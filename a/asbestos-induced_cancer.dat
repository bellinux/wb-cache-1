40|$|Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) is an <b>asbestos-induced</b> <b>cancer</b> with poor prognosis that displays characteristic alterations in microRNA expression. Recently {{it was reported}} that the expression of a subset of microRNAs can distinguish between MPM and adenocarcinoma of the lung. However, the functional importance of these changes has yet to be investigated. We compared expression of miR- 192, miR- 193 a- 3 p and the miR- 200 family in normal pleura and MPM tumor specimens and found a statistically significant reduction in the levels of miR- 193 a- 3 p (3. 1 -fold) and miR- 192 (2. 8 -fold) in MPM. Transfection of MPM cells with a miR- 193 a- 3 p mimic resulted in inhibition of growth and an induction of apoptosis and necrosis in vitro. The growth inhibitory effects of miR- 193 a- 3 p were associated with a decrease in MCL 1 expression and were recapitulated by RNAi-mediated MCL 1 silencing. Targeted delivery of miR- 193 a- 3 p mimic using EDV minicells inhibited MPM xenograft tumour growth, and was associated with increased apoptosis. In conclusion, miR- 193 a- 3 p appears to have importance in the biology of MPM and may represent a target for therapeutic intervention. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background: Malignant {{mesothelioma}} (MM) is {{a highly}} aggressive, incurable <b>asbestos-induced</b> <b>cancer</b> for which treat-ment options are limited. Surgical resection can reduce tumour burden, but patients ultimately succumb to disease due to reoccurrence of unresectable tumour, highlighting {{the need for new}} treatment modalities. In this study we describe the use of an easily translatable heat shock (HS) treated autologous tumour lysate vaccine and discus its potential appli-cation as an adjunct therapy for treating MM. Methods: Heat shocked autologous tumour lysate (HSL) vaccine was generated from AE 17 sOVA mesothelioma cells and tested for its ability to act as a protective or therapeutic vaccine in a murine tumour model. Vaccine efficacy was assessed by tumour growth/survival of vaccinated mice and FACS analysis used to assess DC maturation and trafficking from vaccine site to draining lymphnodes (dLN). Results: Mice vacci-nated prior to tumour challenge with HS lysate induced protection in 40 % of mice and caused a significant delay in tu-mour progression in remaining mice. Vaccine dose-response experiments showed that HS lysate was at least a log more efficient at retarding tumour growth and promoting survival than untreated lysate. HS and untreated lysate were equally effective at maturating DCs, but HS lysate improved trafficking of vaccine-site DCs to draining lymph nodes (dLN) ...|$|E
40|$|Asbestos-related cancers such as {{malignant}} mesothelioma and lung cancer {{are an important}} issue in the world. There are many conflicts concerning economical considerations and medical evidence for these cancers and much confusion regarding details of the pathological mechanisms of <b>asbestos-induced</b> <b>cancers.</b> For example, there is uncertainty concerning the degree of danger of the iron-absent chrysotile compared with iron-containing crocidolite and amosite. However, regarding bad prognosis of mesothelioma, medical approaches to ensure {{the recognition of the}} biological effects of asbestos and the pathological mechanisms of asbestos-induced carcinogenesis, as well as clinical trials to detect the early stage of mesothelioma, should result in better preventions and the cure of these malignancies. We have been investigating the immunological effects of asbestos in relation to the reduction of tumor immunity. In this paper, cellular and molecular approaches to clarify the immunological effects of asbestos are described, and all the findings indicate that the reduction of tumor immunity is caused by asbestos exposure and involvement in <b>asbestos-induced</b> <b>cancers.</b> These investigations may not only allow the clear recognition of the biological effects of asbestos, but also present a novel procedure for early detection of previous asbestos exposure and the presence of mesothelioma as well as the chemoprevention of asbestos-related cancers...|$|R

40|$|Carcinogenicity of {{asbestos}} {{has been well}} established for decades and it has similar approval standards in most advanced countries based {{on a number of}} studies and international meetings. However, Korea has been lagging behind such international standards. In this study, we proposed the approval standards of an occupational cancer due to asbestos through intensive review on the Helsinki Criteria, post-Helsinki studies, job exposure matrix (JEM) based on the analysis of domestic reports and recognized occupational lung cancer cases in Korea. The main contents of proposed approval standards are as follows; In recognizing an <b>asbestos-induced</b> lung <b>cancer,</b> diagnosis {{of asbestos}}is should be based on CT. In addition, initial findings of asbestosis on CT should be considered. High Exposure industries and occupations to asbestos should be also taken into account in Korea An expert’s determination is warranted in case of a worker who has been concurrently exposed to other carcinogens, even if the asbestos exposure duration is less than 10 years. Determination of a larynx cancer due to asbestos exposure has the same approval standards with an <b>asbestos-induced</b> lung <b>cancer.</b> However, for an ovarian cancer, an expert’s judgment is necessary even if asbestosis, pleural plaque or pleural thickening and high concentration asbestos exposure are confirmed. Cigarette smoking status or the extent should not affect determination of an occupational cancer caused by asbestos as smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect in causing a lung cancer and they are involved in carcinogenesis in a complicated manner...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A 76 -year-old male {{died of lung}} cancer. At first, he was {{diagnosed}} as a silicosis, because he had worked for 30 years as a caster in shipyard and large opacities detected by chest x-ray and CT scanning. After the operation of lung cancer, numerous asbestos bodies were observed in the operated lung tissues. The detailed occupational inquiry revealed his asbestos use as a caster in shipyard. Early stage of asbestosis was suspected by chest CT scanning, but not definitely diagnosed in premortal examinations. Asbestosis, pleural plaques, silicosis and large cell carcinoma of the lung were histopathologically confirmed at the autopsy. A patient with <b>asbestos-induced</b> lung <b>cancer</b> complicated by silicosis was rarely published in the literature...|$|R
30|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that both single-walled (SW) and {{multi-walled}} (MW) CNT deposit in the deep lung tissue of mice with low clearance after pulmonary administration [7 - 9]. Occupationally relevant in vivo exposures (10 to 80  μg/mouse) and pulmonary fibroblast in vitro exposure studies, using in vivo dose equivalents (0.02 to 0.2  μg/cm 2), resulted in dose-dependent transient pulmonary inflammation followed by fibroblast cell proliferation, alveolar wall thickening, and collagen I production culminating in persistent pulmonary fibrosis [9, 10]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested the potential carcinogenicity of CNT [11 - 13]. The possible carcinogenic mechanisms include DNA damage [14 - 16], mitotic disruption [12], impaired apoptosis, and activation of oncogenic signaling events, which recapitulate <b>asbestos-induced</b> lung <b>cancer</b> and mesothelioma [17 - 19]. It was suggested that nanotube bundles are similar in size to microtubules that form the mitotic spindle and may be incorporated into the mitotic spindle apparatus, resulting in multipolar mitosis and aneuploidy [20] which were observed in asbestos-treated cells [15]. Furthermore, CNT exposure induced asbestos-like granulomas in mice in a short-term abdominal instillation study [18].|$|R
40|$|The adverse {{pulmonary}} {{effects of}} asbestos are well accepted in scientific circles. However, the extrapulmonary consequences of asbestos exposure {{are not as}} clearly defined. In this review the potential for asbestos to produce diseases of the peritoneum, immune, gastrointestinal (GIT), and reproductive systems are explored as evidenced in published, peer-reviewed literature. Several hundred epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro publications analyzing the extrapulmonary effects of asbestos were used as sources {{to arrive at the}} conclusions and to establish areas needing further study. In order to be considered, each study had to monitor extrapulmonary outcomes following exposure to asbestos. The literature supports a strong association between asbestos exposure and peritoneal neoplasms. Correlations between asbestos exposure and immune-related disease are less conclusive; nevertheless, it was concluded from the combined autoimmune studies that there is a possibility for a higher-than-expected risk of systemic autoimmune disease among asbestos-exposed populations. In general, the GIT effects of asbestos exposure appear to be minimal, with the most likely outcome being development of stomach cancer. However, IARC recently concluded the evidence to support <b>asbestos-induced</b> stomach <b>cancer</b> to be “limited. ” The strongest evidenc...|$|R
40|$|With {{more than}} 20 years having {{passed since the}} last EPA risk {{assessment}} for asbestos, it is about {{time to take a}} new look at the data and conduct a risk assessment that is based on the current state of knowledge of asbestos-induced disease, particularly the current state of knowledge regarding the dependence of risk on fiber type and fiber dimensions. It {{seems to me that the}} EPA has two choices here. One choice might be to acknowledge that risk assessments need to be easily understood and transparent, but that the science is complex and difficult to understand. Thus the EPA could choose to make a number of simplifying assumptions and arrive at estimates of risk that it believes to be protective of public health while acknowledging that these numbers do not represent outputs from the best possible analyses. The second choice, which the EPA appears to be making here, is to conduct the best possible analyses of the available data. If this is indeed the choice EPA has made, then it falls short, particularly in its choice of models for analyses. There are three fundamental issues the EPA has to address here. 1. The choice of the appropriate bin-specific models for <b>asbestos-induced</b> lung <b>cancer</b> and mesothelioma (I will not discuss asbestosis here) ...|$|R
40|$|Fas-associated factor (FAF) - 1 is a multidomain {{protein that}} was first {{identified}} {{as a member of}} the Fas death-inducing signaling complex, but later found to be involved in various biological processes. Although the exact mechanisms are not clear, FAF 1 seems to play an important role in <b>cancer,</b> <b>asbestos-induced</b> mesotheliomas, and Parkinson's disease. It interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, Hsp 70, and p 97 /VCP (valosin-containing protein), in addition to the proteins of the Fas-signaling pathway. We have determined the crystal structure of the ubiquitin-associated domain of human FAF 1 (hFAF 1 -UBA) and examined its interaction with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance. hFAF 1 -UBA revealed a canonical three-helical bundle that selectively binds to mono- and di-ubiquitin (Lys 48 -linked), but not to SUMO- 1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier 1) or NEDD 8 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8). The interaction between hFAF 1 -UBA and di-ubiquitin involves hydrophobic interaction accompanied by a transition in the di-ubiquitin conformation. These results provide structural insight into the mechanism of polyubiquitin recognition by hFAF 1 -UBA...|$|R
