5|$|Hangar 5, the westernmost {{original}} hangar, houses Duxford's aircraft conservation workshops. Open to the public, {{the hangar}} allows visitors to see museum staff and volunteers <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> {{a variety of}} conservation tasks. Notable projects include a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter acquired from an American owner in 'jungle recovery' condition, and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 now on display in AirSpace. Duxford is a partner with the British Aviation Preservation Council in the National Aviation Heritage Skills Initiative, which has been funded since 2005 by the Heritage Lottery Fund and aims to provide training to volunteers supporting aviation heritage projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{the sons}} of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{landscape}} architect for Central Park in New York, Carey and Frederick, Jr. were asked to design the park's master plan while they were <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> Grant Park. The city agreed to pay $1,800 for the plan, but Olmsted was concerned that Atlanta might not have enough money for the necessary improvements.|$|E
5|$|While <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> The Songlines between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin {{frequently}} {{came down}} with colds. He also developed skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{designed}} Deal Castle, but Sir Edward Ryngeley and Thomas Wingfield served as the commissioners for the project, with Robert Loyrde and David Marten as the paymaster and comptroller, and Christopher Dickenson and William Clement as the master mason and carpenters. Work began at Deal in April and progressed at speed, with 1,400 men <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the site by the following month. A strike for higher pay was broken up over the summer by Ryngeley and by December, when Anne of Cleves dined there, the castle was mostly completed. Deal and the other fortifications along the Downs cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build, much of which came from proceeds of {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries a few years before. Lead, timber and stone from local monasteries were also recycled for use in Deal Castle.|$|E

5|$|The Duke's {{return to}} favour under the House of Hanover {{enabled him to}} preside over {{the defeat of the}} 1715 Jacobite rising from London (although it was his former assistant, Cadogan, who {{directed}} the operations). But his health was fading, and on 28 May 1716 (O.S.), shortly {{after the death of his}} daughter Anne, Countess of Sunderland, he suffered a paralytic stroke at Holywell House. This was followed by another, more severe stroke in November, this time at a house on the Blenheim estate. The Duke recovered somewhat, but while his speech had become impaired his mind remained clear, recovering enough to ride out to watch the builders <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> Blenheim Palace and attend the Lords to vote for Oxford's impeachment.|$|E

25|$|Impatient to {{complete}} his epic cycle, Wagner began work on the preliminary draft of Götterdämmerung on 2 October 1869, {{while he was still}} <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the third act of Siegfried. There was to be no fair copy of this the final opera in the cycle, so the three acts passed through just three stages: preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), orchestral draft (Orchesterskizze), and full score (Partiturerstschrift). Wagner had altered his modus operandi once again while <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the last two acts of Die Meistersinger: now it was his practice to finish both complete drafts of each act in turn before beginning the full score of the entire opera.|$|E
25|$|Orciani {{was arrested}} May 6, but gave the alibi {{that he had}} been <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the day of both crimes.

The {{self-employed}} Vanzetti had no such alibis and was charged for the attempted robbery and attempted murder in Bridgewater and the robbery and murder in the Braintree crimes. Sacco and Vanzetti were charged with the crime of murder on May 5, 1920 and indicted four months later on September 14.|$|E
