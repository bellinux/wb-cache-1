5|$|Airspace: in many European countries, {{the growth}} of civil {{aviation}} is {{reducing the amount of}} uncontrolled airspace. In the U.S. new security requirements, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> controlled airspace around cities, has also had some impact on where to fly.|$|E
5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in part due to the slowdown of the region's manufacturing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E

5|$|From {{the bone}} {{features}} of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, {{it is estimated that}} Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may be much higher because in the process of bones remodeling <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needs 18–24 years to be mature.|$|E

5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.|$|E

5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> international markets also impact {{on the number of}} people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E
5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> federal power.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis {{served as}} a {{gathering}} place for organizing troops. As Indianapolis's citizens rallied {{in support of the}} Union, its population increased with the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities and spurred real estate development. City residents experienced rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. It was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. The Civil War era ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development, its connections to an expanding railroad network, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> local charitable organizations.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war the Texas economy declined for a period. Nevertheless, ranching interests became major economic drivers in the area spawning many other economic enterprises such as hide processing plants and shipping concerns. The success of these enterprises <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Galveston as one of the prime commercial centers in the South and Southwest helped promote the construction of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway; and the La Porte, Houston and Northern Railroad through the area {{over the course of the}} 19th century. These railroads running along the southwest shore of the bay would spawn new communities such as Clear Creek (League City), Webster, and later Texas City.|$|E

5|$|Much {{of modern}} popular music can trace its roots to the {{emergence}} in the late 19th century of African American blues <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> gospel music in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African roots in the music tradition of the original white settlers, such as country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish communities, among others.|$|E
5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. Reading's trade benefited from better designed turnpike roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to Oxford and the West Country. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the River Kennet to boats as far as Newbury. Opposition stopped when it became apparent that the new route benefited the town. After the opening of the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810, one could go by barge from Reading to the Bristol Channel. From 1714, and probably earlier, the role of county town of Berkshire was shared between Reading and Abingdon.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{originally}} {{settled in the}} late 17thcentury by Jacob Rutsen, a merchant from Albany, but did not become a major population center until the 1825 discovery of Rosendale cement in the region; {{the development of the}} cement industry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the Delaware and Hudson Canal along the Rondout Creek and Main Street, gave rise to substantial economic development in Rosendale. The town's cement was used in the construction of numerous national landmarks. The Wallkill Valley Railroad reached the village in 1871, and its depot in the village was the largest station on the Wallkill Valley line. Rosendale was formally incorporated as a village in 1890.|$|E
