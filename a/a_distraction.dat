40|$|Background Knee joint <b>distraction</b> (KJD) is <b>a</b> {{surgical}} joint-preserving {{treatment in}} which the knee joint is temporarily distracted by an external frame. It is associated with joint tissue repair and clinical improvement. Initially, patients were submitted to <b>an</b> eight-week <b>distraction</b> period, and currently patients are submitted to <b>a</b> six-week <b>distraction</b> period. This study evaluates whether <b>a</b> shorter <b>distraction</b> period influences the outcome. Methods Both groups consisted of 20 patients. Clinical outcome was assessed by WOMAC questionnaires and VAS-pain. Cartilaginous tissue repair was assessed by radiographic joint space width (JSW) and MRI-observed cartilage thickness. Results Baseline data between both groups were comparable. Both groups showed an increase in total WOMAC score; 24  ±  4 in the six-week group and 32  ±  5 in the eight-week group (both p <  0. 001). Mean JSW increased 0. 9  ±  0. 3  mm in the six-week group and 1. 1  ±  0. 3  mm in the eight-week group (p =  0. 729 between groups). The increase in mean cartilage thickness on MRI was 0. 6  ±  0. 2  mm in the eight-week group and 0. 4  ±  0. 1  mm in the six-week group (p =  0. 277). Conclusions <b>A</b> shorter <b>distraction</b> period does not influence short-term clinical and structural outcomes statistically significantly, although effect sizes tend to be smaller in six week KJD as compared to eight week KJD...|$|R
