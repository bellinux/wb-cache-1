40|$|Introduction : Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} sperm nuclear chromatin condensation and its correlation with semen parameters and vitality test in infertile patients {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI), varicocele, and idiopathic infertility. Materials and Methods : Sperm chromatin condensation was determined by <b>aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> in 22 SCI-injured infertile men, 20 with varicocele, and 28 with idiopathic infertility. The results were compared with the semen analysis parameters and the hypo-osmotic swelling test results. Three grades of staining for sperm heads were distinguished: unstained, showing sperm maturity (G 0); partially stained (G 1); and completely stained, showing sperm immaturity (G 2). The total score was calculated as: (G 0 × 0) + (G 1 × 1) + (G 2 × 2). Results : In all groups, the total staining score was higher than 75 %, corresponding to a high degree of immaturity of sperm. Patients with SCI had a less sperm nuclear chromatin condensation and chromatin stability than patients with idiopathic infertility and varicocele (total scores, 98 % versus 89 % and 88 %, respectively; P Conclusion : <b>Aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> for sperm nuclear chromatin condensation is a method independent of semen analysis and demonstrates the internal structural defects of sperm.

Clustered stomata were also induced by treatment with glucose or fructose solution but not by mannitol solution, suggesting that osmotic stress was not a cause of the disturbed stomatal patterns. Stomatal lineage cell-specific enhancer trap lines revealed that the sugar solution treatment led to ectopic expression of stomatal lineage cell-specific genes in non-stomatal lineage cells. <b>Aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> also showed that there was reduced deposition of callose, a plant cell wall component, in new cell walls during formation of stomatal precursor cells (meristemoids).

In order to solve the argument, we investigated pistil receptivity, seed set, and compatible index of 24 chrysanthemum cultivars.

However, only 10 of them produced self-pollinated seeds, and their seed sets and compatible indexes were 0. 03 – 56. 50 % and 0. 04 – 87. 50, respectively. The cultivar “Q 10 - 33 - 1 ” had the highest seed set (56. 50 %) and compatible index (87. 50), but ten of its progeny had a wide range of separation in seed set (0 – 37. 23 %) and compatible index (0 – 68. 65). The results indicated that most of chrysanthemum cultivars were self-incompatible, while a small proportion of cultivars were self-compatible. In addition, there is a comprehensive separation of self-incompatibility among progeny from the same self-pollinated self-compatible chrysanthemum cultivar. Therefore, it is better to emasculate inflorescences during chrysanthemum hybridization breeding when no information concerning its self-incompatibility characteristics is available.

Results: The data revealed that spermatozoa of OAT and MUI cases when exposed to UV-radiation showed higher percentage of immature sperm compared with normal fertile individuals. Higher percentage of Chromomycin A 3 fluorescence in OAT and MUI cases revealed impaired DNAprotamine binding with subsequent DNA fragmentation after exposure to UV. Conclusions: In the present study, sperm chromatin is at higher risk of DNA fragmentation in the infertile (OAT and MUI) cases due to UV irradiation (254 nm).

Urban using <b>aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> of pollen tubes and fluorescence microscopy. We show that sites of incompatibility {{occur in the}} stigma and upper regions of the style. There is an asymmetry between the morphs where, following selfing, pollen tubes tend to grow further into long-styled compared to short-styled plants, although the difference is not particularly marked. We demonstrate {{for the first time}} a qualitative difference in the appearance of pollen tubes. Upon self-pollination, pollen tubes in short-styled plants do not produce callose plugs, while all other pollinations result in callose plug formation. This could indicate that there is a difference in the mechanisms of incompatibility between the morphs. Exploiting crosses between two populations of Turnera scabra Millsp. that differ in flower size, we found no support for the hypothesis that incompatibility of long-styled plants is the result of insufficient nutrient reserves in pollen. Bud-pollinations provided limited support for the hypothesis that a short-specific style protein is involved in incompatibility. Crosses between distylous and homostylous species provided support for a recombinant origin for homostyly for four species, while deviations from this expectation were observed in four instances.

In our current investigations, we focussed on morphological consequences and changes in mRNA and protein expression in hearts from these animals. mRNA expression was analysed by differential display analysis and Northern blot as well as by cDNA microarray analysis followed by pathway analysis. Protein expression was examined using immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Fibrosis was determined by chromotrope <b>aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> for collagen. A distinct increase in the expression of α-tubulin mRNA was noted in hearts of all mutant mouse strains compared with the control.

Using cDNA microarray analysis, we detected an activation of apoptosis, in particular an increase of caspase- 3 expression in hearts of mice overexpressing LPL but not in PPARα knockout mice overexpressing LPL. This finding was confirmed immunohistochemically. In addition, we identified a distinct interstitial increase in collagen and an increase around blood vessels. In our mouse model, we detect mRNA and protein changes typical for cardiomyopathy even before overt clinical signs of heart failure. In addition, a small but distinct increase in the rate of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and fibrotic changes contributes to cardiac failure in mice overexpressing LPL, whereas additional deficiency in PPARα seems to protect hearts from these effects...|$|R

Plants utilize calmodulin-activated Ca 2 + pumps (autoinhibited Ca 2 +-ATPase [ACA]) at the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuole. Here, we show that a double knockout mutation of the vacuolar Ca 2 + pumps ACA 4 and ACA 11 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) results in a high frequency of hypersensitive response-like lesions. The appearance of macrolesions could be suppressed by growing plants with increased levels (greater than 15 mm) of various anions, providing a method for conditional suppression. By removing plants from a conditional suppression, lesion initials were found to originate primarily in leaf mesophyll cells, as detected by <b>aniline</b> blue <b>staining.</b> Initiation and spread of lesions could also be suppressed by disrupting the production or accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), as shown by combining aca 4 / 11 mutations with a sid 2 (for salicylic acid induction-deficient 2) mutation or expression of the SA degradation enzyme NahG. This indicates {{that the loss of}} the vacuolar Ca 2 + pumps by itself does not cause a catastrophic defect in ion homeostasis but rather potentiates the activation of a SA-dependent programmed cell death pathway.

40|$|COMATOSE (CTS) encodes a peroxisomal ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter required {{not only}} for beta-oxidation of storage lipids during germination and establishment, but also for biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and conversion of indole butyric acid to indole acetic acid. cts mutants exhibited reduced fertilization, which was rescued by genetic complementation, but not by exogenous application of jasmonic acid or indole acetic acid. Reduced fertilization was also observed in thiolase (kat 2 - 1) and peroxisomal acyl-Coenzyme A synthetase mutants (lacs 6 - 1, lacs 7 - 1), indicating a general role for beta-oxidation in fertility. Genetic analysis revealed reduced male transmission of cts alleles and both cts pollen germination and tube growth in vitro were impaired {{in the absence of}} an exogenous carbon source. <b>Aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> of pollinated pistils demonstrated that pollen tube growth was affected only when both parents bore the cts mutation, indicating that expression of CTS in either male or female tissues was sufficient to support pollen tube growth in vivo. Accordingly, abundant peroxisomes were detected in a range of maternal tissues. Although gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were reduced in flowers of cts mutants, they were unchanged in kat 2 - 1, suggesting that alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid catabolism do not contribute to the reduced fertility phenotype through altered pollen tube targeting. Taken together, our data support an important role for beta-oxidation in fertility in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and suggest that this pathway could play a role in the mobilization of lipids in both pollen and female tissues...|$|R
40|$|Lasers have in {{principle}} {{the capability to}} cut {{at the level of}} a single cell, the fundamental limit to minimally invasive procedures and restructuring biological tissues. To date, this limit has not been achieved due to collateral damage on the macroscale that arises from thermal and shock wave induced collateral damage of surrounding tissue. Here, we report on a novel concept using a specifically designed Picosecond IR Laser (PIRL) that selectively energizes water molecules in the tissue to drive ablation or cutting process faster than thermal exchange of energy and shock wave propagation, without plasma formation or ionizing radiation effects. The targeted laser process imparts the least amount of energy in the remaining tissue without any of the deleterious photochemical or photothermal effects that accompanies other laser wavelengths and pulse parameters. Full thickness incisional and excisional wounds were generated in CD 1 mice using the Picosecond IR Laser, a conventional surgical laser (DELight Er:YAG) or mechanical surgical tools. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed that the PIRL laser produced minimal tissue ablation with less damage of surrounding tissues than wounds formed using the other modalities. The width of scars formed by wounds made by the PIRL laser were half that of the scars produced using either a conventional surgical laser or a scalpel. <b>Aniline</b> blue <b>staining</b> showed higher levels of collagen in the early stage of the wounds produced using the PIRL laser, suggesting that these wounds mature faster. There were more viable cells extracted from skin using the PIRL laser, suggesting less cellular damage. b-catenin and TGF-...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of megasporocytes and the functional megaspore formation in Deschampsia antarctica were analyzed {{with the use}} of microscopic methods. A single archesporial cell was formed directly under the epidermis in the micropylar region of the ovule without producing a parietal cell. In successive stages of development, the meiocyte was transformed into a megaspore tetrad after meiosis. Most megaspores were arranged in a linear fashion, but some tetrads were T-shaped. Only one of the 60 analyzed ovules contained a cell in the direct proximity of the megasporocyte, which could be an aposporous initial. Most of the evaluated D. antarctica ovules featured monosporic embryo sacs of the Polygonum type. Approximately 30 % of ovules contained numerous megaspores that were enlarged. The megaspores were located at chalazal and micropylar poles, and some ovules featured two megaspores – terminal and medial – in the chalazal region, or even three megaspores at the chalazal pole. In those cases, the micropylar megaspore was significantly smaller than the remaining megaspores, and it did not have the characteristic features of functional megaspores. Meiocytes and megaspores of D. antarctica contained polysaccharides that were detectable by PAS-reaction and <b>aniline</b> blue <b>staining.</b> Starch granules and cell walls of megasporocytes, megaspores and nucellar cells were PAS-positive. Fluorescent callose deposits were identified in the micropylar end of the megasporocytes. During meiosis and after its completion, thick callose deposits were also visible in the periclinal walls and in a small amount in the anticlinal walls of megaspores forming linear and T-shaped tetrads. Callose deposits fluorescence was not observed in the walls of the nucellar cells...|$|R

40|$|Background: One of the {{affecting}} {{factors in}} disturbance process of spermatogenesis is chemotherapeutic-induced oxidative stress resulted from cyclophosphamide (CP) treatment {{which leads to}} diminished sperm quality via interference in spermatogenesis process. Objective: This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of ethyl pyruvate (EP) in reducing the CP-induced side effects on reproductive system. Materials and Methods: 24 mature male mice were randomly divided into 3 equal groups and were undergone therapy for 35 days. Control group received normal saline (0. 1 ml/day, IP). CP group were injected CP (15 mg/kg/week, IP) and CP+EP group received EP (40 mg/kg/day, IP) as well as CP. In the end of the treatment period, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Then, the epididymis was incubated with CO 2 in a human tubal fluid medium (1 ml) for half an hour in order to float sperm. Then, the number, motility, viability (eosin-nigrosin staining), DNA breakage (acridine orange staining), nucleus maturity, and sperm morphology (<b>aniline</b> blue <b>staining)</b> were analyzed. Results: The average (15. 87 ± 1. 28), motility (35. 77 ± 2. 75), viability (40 ± 3. 03), nucleus maturity (36 ± 2. 79) and sperm morphology (61. 75 ± 0. 85) were decreased significantly in CP group in comparison with control and EP groups, whereas EP caused significant increase of these parameters. Also, the percentage of DNA damage was increased significantly in CP group (41. 75 ± 3. 75) in comparison with control (2 ± 0. 71) and EP groups (22. 5 ± 4. 13). Conclusion: The results of this study revealed ameliorating effects of EP on sperm quality of CP treated animals. ...|$|R
