5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender and this has been repeated in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the series increased dramatically {{with the release of}} Guitar Hero II for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. Featuring improved multiplayer gameplay, an improved note-recognizing system, and 64 songs, it became the fifth best-selling video game of 2006. The PlayStation 2 version of the game was offered both separately and in a bundle with <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> red Gibson SG guitar controller. Guitar Hero II was later released for the Xbox 360 in April 2007 with an exclusive Gibson Explorer guitar controller and an additional 10 songs, among other features. About 3 million units of Guitar Hero II have sold on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike is {{a comedy}} play written by Christopher Durang. The story {{revolves}} around the relationships of three middle-aged single siblings, two of whom live together, and takes place during a visit by the third, Masha, who supports them. They discuss their lives and loves, argue, and Masha threatens to sell the house. Some of the show's elements were derived from works of Anton Chekhov, including several character names, the play's setting in <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> orchard, and {{the theme of the}} possible loss of an ancestral home.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Albert Benjamin Chandler {{was born}} in the farming {{community}} of Corydon, Kentucky in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said his mother leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> tree when he was 13 years old.|$|E
5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> tree to appeal to international audiences. To complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E

5|$|Hess was {{promoted}} to platoon leader of the 10th Company of the 18th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment, which was serving in Romania. He was wounded on 23 July and again on 8 August 1917; the first injury was a shell splinter to the left arm, which was dressed in the field, but the second was a bullet wound that entered the upper chest near the armpit and exited near his spinal column, leaving a pea-sized entry wound and <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> stone-sized exit wound on his back. By 20 August he was well enough to travel, so {{he was sent to}} hospital in Hungary and eventually back to Germany, where he recovered in hospital in Meissen. In October he received promotion to Leutnant der Reserve and was recommended for, but did not receive, the Iron Cross, first class. At his father's request, Hess was transferred to a hospital closer to home, arriving at Alexandersbad on 25 October.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939 Knight {{was asked}} to produce a {{recruitment}} poster for the Women's Land Army, WLA. Knight hired two Suffolk Punch horses and a plough from a farmer and painted them outdoors in <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> orchard on Averills' farm in Worcestershire. Her original design for the WLA poster was rejected for placing {{too much emphasis on}} the horses rather than the women working. A new design, with a single woman, was accepted. Knight painted her 1940 Royal Academy entry, January 1940, showing a similar scene at the same time. During the Second World War, Knight was an official war artist, contracted by the War Artists' Advisory Committee on several short-term commissions.|$|E
5|$|Like in the {{original}} Guitar Hero, the player uses a peripheral {{in the shape of}} a solid-body electric guitar to simulate playing rock music as notes scroll towards the player. Most of the gameplay from {{the original}} game remains intact, and provides new modes and note combinations. The game features more than 40 popular licensed songs, many of them cover versions recorded for the game, spanning five decades (from the 1960s to the 2000s). The PlayStation 2 version of Guitar Hero II can be purchased individually or in a bundle that packages the game with <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> red Gibson SG guitar controller. The Xbox 360 version of the game is offered in a bundle that packages the game with a white Gibson Explorer guitar controller.|$|E

5|$|The {{gardens are}} Grade II* {{listed on the}} Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The gardens of the house were also created {{in line with the}} Arts and Crafts movement, {{providing}} food for the house. Influenced strongly by Margaret Bidulph, who had studied at Studley Horticultural College, where she had met her future head gardener William Scrubey. Scrubey and Margaret Biddulph would go on to plant the gardens together. The terrace and gardens south to the south of the house include yew hedges to create specific spaces, mixed with Portuguese laurels and roses, giving the impression of exterior rooms next to the house. Nearby is an area of topiary, clipped in domes and tiers. At {{the far end of the}} south terrace is a ha-ha, leading to <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> orchard and tennis courts, although only one tennis court remains, the others have been converted in a croquet lawn and a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired <b>a</b> <b>cherry</b> picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E
