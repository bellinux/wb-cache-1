5|$|In {{regards to}} {{pathogenic}} care, or {{the type of}} care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with <b>a</b> <b>caregiver.</b>|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from <b>a</b> <b>caregiver.</b> The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

25|$|John Bowlby, who {{developed}} attachment theory, also describes the negative mental health consequences, {{based on his}} observations, of the effects on infants and young children when a positive relationship with <b>a</b> <b>caregiver</b> is lacking. In addition there is significant research supporting the linkage between early experiences of chronic maltreatment and later problems.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of this {{treatment}} {{also believe that}} emotional attachment of a child to <b>a</b> <b>caregiver</b> begins during the prenatal period, during which the unborn child {{is aware of the}} mother's thoughts and emotions. If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|E
25|$|Neglect is {{a passive}} form of abuse in which <b>a</b> <b>caregiver</b> {{responsible}} for providing care for a victim (a child, a physically or mentally disabled adult, an animal, a plant, or an inanimate object) fails to provide adequate care for the victim's needs, {{to the detriment of}} the victim. It is typically seen as a form of laziness or apathy on the form of the caregiver, rather than ignorance due to inability; accordingly, neglect of a child by and adult with mental disorders or who is overworked is not considered abuse, although this may constitute child neglect nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|Personal {{emergency}} response systems (PERS), or Telecare (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An {{example would be}} the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for hypothermia risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild dementia). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks.

25|$|The {{size of the}} {{production}} vocabulary ranges from about 50 to 550 words {{at the age of}} 2 years. Influences on the rate of word learning, and thus on the wide range of vocabulary sizes of children of the same age, include the amount of speech children are exposed to by their caregivers as well as differences in how rich the vocabulary in the speech a child hears is. Children also seem to build up their vocabulary faster if the speech they hear is related to their focus of attention more often. This would be the case if <b>a</b> <b>caregiver</b> talks about a ball the child is currently looking at.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between both the social support and resources of child kinship caregivers and the caregivers’ health. An exploratory sequential three phase mixed methods design was used. Phase I encompassed a single case study of a Nebraska program serving largely grandparents raising grandchildren. Phase II consisted of multiple individual caregiver case studies, and Phase III consisted of a survey of all caregivers affiliated with the program. Qualitative findings from the first two phases yielded similar caregiver information regarding social support and resources issues. Differing information was received regarding health issues.

25|$|Attachment theory also postulates {{that all}} humans possess an innate {{attachment}} behavioural system that motivates them to seek proximity to <b>a</b> <b>caregiver</b> (also called an attachment figure) {{during times of}} threat or need. Caregiving behaviour is therefore complimentary to attachment behaviour. Furthermore, attachment theory argues that {{the effectiveness of the}} caregiving behaviour enacted determines the quality of the attachment bond between the caregiver and care-recipient, as well as shapes the care-recipient’s general expectations of social support. In this model, a history of receiving effective care from intimate others (whether parents in childhood or romantic partners in adulthood) promotes a sense of attachment security – an interpersonal orientation characterized by the expectation that other people may be relied on for support, and subsequent comfort with intimacy and emotional closeness. In contrast, a history of interactions with cold or rejecting caregivers promotes attachment avoidance – an interpersonal orientation marked by discomfort with intimacy, a reluctance to rely on others for support, and the tendency to suppress emotional distress. Care that is inconsistent or intrusive is believed to foster attachment anxiety, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with intimate relationships and inability to effectively regulate one’s own emotional distress.|$|E

50|$|The assessment/management {{approach}} is predictive of malfunctions in infant-caregiver communication. For example, colic {{is common in}} technologically developed western countries, and {{may be the result}} of the decreased proximity between caregiver and infant.

40|$|Abstract—Joint attention, i. e., the {{behavior}} {{of looking at the}} same object that another person is looking at, {{plays an important role in}} human and human-robot communication. Previous synthetic studies focusing on modeling the early developmental process of joint attention have proposed learning methods without explicit instructions for joint attention. In these studies, the causal structure between a perception variable (<b>a</b> <b>caregiver’s</b> face direction or an individual object) and an action variable (gaze shift to <b>a</b> <b>caregiver’s</b> face or to an object location) was given in advance to learn joint attention. However, such a structure is expected to be found by the robot through interaction experiences. In this paper, we investigates how transfer entropy, an information theory measure, is used to quantify the causality inherent in face-to-face interaction. In computer simulations of human-robot interaction, we examine which pair of perceptions and actions is selected as the causal pair and show that the selected pairs can be used for learning a sensorimotor map for joint attention.
