30|$|RDATA (Relay Data): like a DATA frame, the <b>Address</b> 1 field {{contains}} the <b>address</b> of the receiver, the <b>Address</b> 2 field {{contains the}} <b>address</b> of the sender, and the <b>Address</b> 3 field contains the BSSID. On the first hop, for example, <b>Address</b> 1 holds the <b>address</b> {{of the relay}} and <b>Address</b> 2 holds the <b>address</b> of the AP. Likewise on the second hop, <b>Address</b> 1 holds the <b>address</b> of the relay and <b>Address</b> 2 holds the <b>address</b> of the destination node. The <b>Address</b> 4 field, not used in regular DATA frames unless the To DS and From DS bits are both set, is used in RDATA to hold the <b>address</b> of the destination node for both hops.|$|R

A connection between a sender and a receiver can be identified using an <b>address</b> pair (sender <b>address,</b> receiver <b>address).</b> Usually some <b>address</b> values have special meanings. An all-1s <b>address</b> could be taken to mean an <b>addressing</b> of all stations on the network, so sending to this <b>address</b> would result in a broadcast on the local network. The rules describing the meanings of the <b>address</b> value are collectively called an <b>addressing</b> scheme.|$|R
