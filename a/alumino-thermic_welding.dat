Today it is a basic method for rail joints on railway switches. The analysis of the metal structure in the thermic welding and in the thermic welded zone of rails showed that the weld metal had inclusions small pores and nonmetallics.

40|$|Abstract. Rail {{transport}} development offers {{economic and}} ecological interests. Nevertheless, it requires heavy investments in rolling material and infrastructure. To be competitive, this transportation means {{must rely on}} safe and reliable infrastructure, which requires optimization of all implemented techniques and structure. Rail thermite (or <b>alumino-thermic)</b> <b>welding</b> is widely used within the railway industry for in-track welding during re-rail and defect replacement. The process provides numerous advantages against other welding technology commonly used. Obviously, future demands on train traffic are heavier axle loads, higher train speeds and increased traffic density. Thus, a new enhanced weld should be developed to prevent accidents due to fracture of welds and to lower maintenance costs. In order to improve such assembly process, a detailed metallurgical study coupled to a thermomechanical modeling of the phenomena involved in the rail thermite welding process is carried out. Obtained data enables us {{to develop a new}} improved alumino-thermic weld (type A). This joint is made by modifying the routinely specified procedure (type B) used in a railway rail by a standard gap alumino-thermic weld. Joints of type A and B are tested and compared.

40|$|Abstract: In this article, a {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to evaluate the}} economic life of rail using a sto-chastic analysis of rail failures. The occurrence of rail defects and failures is analysed and issues related to rail maintenance are addressed. The hazard rate of <b>alumino-thermic</b> <b>weld</b> failures is predicted for continuously welded rail, where the expected number of welds is increasing in ton-nage {{as a result of}} replacement. Imperfect inspections are modelled for predicting the expected number of failures by employing a filtered non-homogeneous Poisson process. The impact of maintenance on failure occurrence and whole life-cycle cost (LCC) is analysed and integrated within the model. The application and capability of the proposed model and sensitivity of parameters are illustrated {{through the use of a}} practical example. It is shown that an optimal economic life of rail can always be found, as the repair cost and the risk cost of accident are increasing with tonnage that passed through it. In addition, the inspection frequency has a significant impact on rail LCC. The results also suggest that the proposed model is also valid for optimizing the interval between rail inspections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ultrasonic {{techniques}} {{have been used}} for many years for the inspection of rail. These measurements can detect the presence {{of a wide variety of}} defects but there are practical difficulties with the technology. While large transverse cracks of the type likely to cause catastrophic failure can be detected, the large, critical defects can be masked by large numbers of small, surface defects along the length of the rail. It would be very useful to be able to determine reliably the largest defect size in a length of rail. Also <b>alumino-thermic</b> <b>welds</b> are difficult to inspect due to the typical defect orientation and the attenuation of the weld material. Guided waves provide a very attractive solution to these problems; they travel along the rail, for tens or hundreds of metres, and are partially reflected by any defects which are present. They are particularly sensitive to vertical defects and they are used at relatively low frequency so they are not significantly attenuated by weld material. With financial support from Network Rail, the authors have developed a practical inspection tool based on guided wave measurements. This paper describes the design of a pre-production prototype guided wave instrument suitable for site trials. Results obtained at a level crossing are presented that demonstrate the use of the system as a practical screening tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and determine trends in the uncertainty in the life cycle cost (LCC) associated with the maintenance and renewal (M&R) of the rail of a railway track under a fixed set of input parameters and conditions. Rail maintenance models were identified in the literature which use the mean or expected value of the input distributions to determine a corresponding mean or expected LCC. Although these models display important trends with regard to input parameters such as inspection intervals, they provide no means to quantify the uncertainty related to maintenance and renewal decisions. Thus, a numerical model was developed and programmed using MATLAB which allows the quantification of the uncertainty in the LCC estimated for a given set of conditions. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation to determine the LCC associated with the installation, maintenance and renewal of the rail. The model incorporates imperfect inspections, a hazard function for rail fatigue defects modelled using the Weibull probability distribution and a P-F interval for rail fatigue defects modelled using an exponential probability distribution. The model also allows the modelling of maintenance as either perfect or minimal maintenance as well as the use of either flash butt or <b>alumino-thermic</b> <b>welds</b> to conduct the maintenance. This allowed the development of a method to assess which weld type to use to minimise the minimum attainable mean LCC. The developed model was validated against a similar stochastic rail maintenance model from the literature. However, the model from the literature considers only the expected LCC and does not show any uncertainty related thereto. The novelty in this study therefore lies in the fact that the LCC uncertainty can be quantified in the form of a probability distribution at any given renewal tonnage for a given set of conditions. It was found that the distribution of the LCC at a given renewal tonnage followed a lognormal probability distribution. The standard deviation of the lognormal distributions fitted using the method of maximum likelihood was used as a metric to quantify the uncertainty related to the life cycle cost at a given renewal tonnage. The LCC uncertainty was found to increase with an increase in inspection interval length. Furthermore, the uncertainty was also found to increase with a respective increase in renewal tonnage. For varying inspection interval lengths it was found that the uncertainty of combined maintenance costs (planned plus unplanned maintenance costs) tended more strongly towards the uncertainty in the planned maintenance costs for smaller inspection intervals and more strongly towards the uncertainty in unplanned maintenance costs for larger inspection intervals. A critical cost ratio was found of flash butt <b>weld</b> cost to <b>alumino-thermic</b> <b>weld</b> cost at which the minimum attainable mean LCC was equal. It is more economical to use flash butt welding for maintenance if the cost of flash butt welding maintenance produces a cost ratio lower than the critical cost ratio. The developed model could allow railway operators to assess the risk associated with renewal of the rail at varying renewal tonnages for given conditions such as inspection interval lengths, detectability of rail fatigue defects and the arrival rate of rail fatigue defects.
