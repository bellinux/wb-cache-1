50|$|The Piedmontese, {{following}} their defeat by Austria in the First Italian War of Independence, recognised {{their need for}} allies. This led Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, {{the prime minister of}} the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, to attempt to establish relations with other European powers, partially through Piedmont's participation in the Crimean War. In the peace conference at Paris following the Crimean War, Cavour attempted to bring attention to efforts for Italian unification. He found Britain and France to be sympathetic, but entirely unwilling to go against Austrian wishes, as any movement towards Italian independence would necessarily threaten Austria's territory of Lombardy-Venetia. Private talks between Napoleon III and Cavour after the conference identified Napoleon as the most likely, albeit <b>still</b> <b>uncommitted,</b> candidate for aiding Italy.|$|R

As there were <b>still</b> <b>uncommitted</b> clans who might be tempted to attack the Tokugawa from the rear, time was on the side of Hideyori. Ieyasu used the steadily improving bombardment to pressure for peace negotiation. [...] Hideyori accepted a peace formula whereby the Tokugawa army would withdraw and Osaka castle would remain in Hideyori's hand under the provision of no further [...] "rebellion" [...] against the Tokugawa Shogun. Many Tokugawa troops did not leave but instead worked to fill in the outer moat. Hideyori protested but by the time, a week later, Ieyasu agreed that these had indeed not been included in the peace agreement the outer moat had ceased to exist, and his men were turning to the second moat.|$|R

40|$|Background: Drosophila retinal {{architecture}} is laid down between 24 – 48 hours after puparium formation, {{when some of}} the <b>still</b> <b>uncommitted</b> interommatidial cells (IOCs) are recruited to become secondary and tertiary pigment cells while the remaining ones undergo apoptosis. This choice between survival and death requires the product of the roughest (rst) gene, an immunoglobulin superfamily transmembrane glycoprotein involved {{in a wide range of}} developmental processes. Both temporal misexpression of Rst and truncation of the protein intracytoplasmic domain, lead to severe defects in which IOCs either remain mostly undifferentiated and die late and erratically or, instead, differentiate into extra pigment cells. Intriguingly, mutants not expressing wild type protein often have normal or very mild rough eyes. Methodology/Principal Findings: By using quantitative real time PCR to examine rst transcriptional dynamics in the pupal retina, both in wild type and mutant alleles we showed that tightly regulated temporal changes in rst transcriptional rate underlie its proper function during the final steps of eye patterning. Furthermore we demonstrated that the unexpected wild type eye phenotype of mutants with low or no rst expression correlates with an upregulation in the mRNA levels of the rst paralogue kin-of-irre (kirre), which seems able to substitute for rst function in this process, similarly to their role in myoblast fusion. This compensatory upregulation of kirre mRNA levels could be directly induced in wild type pupa upon RNAi-mediated silencing of rst, indicating that expression of both genes is also coordinately regulated in physiologica...|$|R
500|$|McCarthy's plan to {{gain more}} delegates was {{complicated}} when Senator George McGovern of South Dakota entered the race as the successor to the legacy of Robert Kennedy. The entrance {{had the effect of}} splitting the anti-Humphrey vote. Meanwhile, the McCarthy campaign alleged that Democratic National Chairman John Bailey was giving [...] preferential treatment to Humphrey, to the detriment of McCarthy. They asked for the chairman's resignation, but he rejected the claims and argued that the two candidates were receiving [...] "exactly the same treatment in hotel space, amphitheatre space, telephone service, tickets, transportation and every other phase of convention activity." [...] As the eve of the convention dawned, Humphrey appeared to hold a lead over McCarthy among the delegates with McGovern in a distant third, but with many delegates <b>still</b> <b>uncommitted,</b> the three men battled it out. Meanwhile, on the streets of Chicago, anti-war protests raged as 6,000 federal troops and 18,000 Illinois National Guard defended the premises of the convention. Humphrey won the nomination on the first ballot, despite the fact that McCarthy had won a plurality of the primary vote. Riots intensified, and supporters of McCarthy urged the candidate to run a fourth party campaign against Nixon, Humphrey and George Wallace. He announced that he would not run such a campaign, and stepped down while denying an endorsement to Humphrey. At the end of his campaign, McCarthy stated that he [...] "set out to prove...that {{the people of this country}} could be educated and make a decent judgment...but evidently this is something the politicians were afraid to face up to." ...|$|R

Many names were considered for the proposed party including the [...] "Peoples Party" [...] before Democratic Coalition is selected.In August 1995 a [...] "conference" [...] was held in Christchurch that involves all the MPs as well as Cosgrove and Mark.

Moore declared that he was 95% Committed.By the end of 1995 Over 600 financial members were signed up and the party {{was ready to be}} registered (500 members are required to be registered under New Zealand Electoral Law). However Mike Moore was still undecided on forming the party.During the last week of the 1995 parliamentary session Moore met with Laws, McCardle and Elder to declare himself 99% committed. The first week of the 1996 parliamentary session was discussed as an ideal launch date. However, in an interview with The Sunday Star-Times the following weekend, Mike Moore stated that he was committed to Labour. In January 1996 a meeting was held in Moore's office. With Moore <b>still</b> <b>uncommitted,</b> Michael Laws told the others he will instead join the New Zealand First party. This led to Mike Moore pulling the plug on the project despite the other MPs still being keen.|$|R
50|$|Before the Court of Claims was established, {{monetary}} {{claims against}} the federal government were normally submitted through petitions to Congress. By {{the time of the}} Court's creation, the workload had become unwieldy so Congress gave the Court jurisdiction to hear all monetary claims based upon a law, a regulation, or a federal government contract. The Court was required to report its findings to Congress and to prepare bills for payments to claimants whose petitions were approved by the Court.

This research background by height mount Tax arrears in Indonesia that is reaching Rp. 3, 57 Trliun in 2006. These tax arrears as low indicator of level compliance of taxpayer in Indonesia. Almost 31 % Tax arrears will accumulate in the next year, so that have an effect on to state acceptance from Tax. According to Soemahamidjaja in Waluyo, dkk (2003 : 5) which is expressing that Tax is fee obliged to, in the form of goods or money, collected by power pursuant to law norms, utilize to close goods production cost and collective service in reaching prosperity of public.

Steinert (2003) states that the pressures facing musicians to negotiate between {{the demands of the}} culture industry and the traditional role of the artist generates a fundamental contradiction within art which is symbolically enacted through artistic production. This study, which draws on on-going postgraduate research aims to develop a research framework that investigates how musicians negotiate this contradiction. The study considers if a more reflexive approach to art exists, typified by the Pop Art movement, which paradoxically lends itself to commercial <b>appropriation</b> whilst <b>still</b> remaining a legitimate art form in its own right. This study questions if the interaction of music with marketing represents a commodification or “sell-out” of music or if it can constitute a more reflexive approach towards musical production and the negotiation of Culture Industry pressures...|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws upon}} a neo-Gramscian {{analysis}} of world order to critically assess {{the relationship between}} neo-liberal globalization and socioeconomic rights. It argues that, notwithstanding the well-documented discursive tensions that appear to exist between neo-liberalism and socioeconomic rights, the latter have been reconceptualized {{in a manner that}} is congruent with the hegemonic framework of the former in a number of international institutional settings. This has been achieved in part through three discursive framing devices which will be termed ‘socioeconomic rights as aspirations’, ‘socioeconomic rights as compensation’, and ‘socioeconomic rights as market outcomes’. The article will conclude by arguing that, despite such <b>appropriation,</b> there are <b>still</b> fruitful possibilities for counterhegemonic articulations of socioeconomic rights to contest neo-liberal globalization.

50|$|The {{last act}} {{came on the}} far right of the Russian line where 10,000 troops were <b>still</b> unused and <b>uncommitted.</b> They were faced by the {{advancing}} Highland Brigade; a mere three battalions. Led by Sir Colin Campbell, the 93rd (Highland) Regiment, the 79th (Cameron Highlanders) Regiment and the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment were advancing in a dangerously thin line extended for almost 2000 yd although in the smoke and confusion of battle the Russians were unable to see that it was only two ranks deep. The highly disciplined Highland Brigade advanced firing, a task difficult to accomplish in those days. For the Russians it proved too much and they fell back. The Battle of the Alma was effectively over. On the right of the Allied line, Canrobert had finally got his guns up the cliffs and his Zouaves seized Telegraph Hill. The ridge Lord Raglan had so dramatically made his own was now swarming with red-coated troops. The Russian right was fleeing before the Highland Brigade, the Greater Redoubt was taken and the road to Sevastopol was now open.|$|R

We describe preliminary encounters and findings from demonstrating a working prototype in morning tea gatherings of people in their 50 s-late 70 s and from introducing it into the homes of two people in their 80 s who live on another continent. Key findings are that: The concept of keeping in touch around a "habituated object" such as a kettle was well received; Simple and varied interaction modalities that allow asymmetric forms of communication are needed; Designing for use across different time zones requires attention; And, that even when augmenting a habituated object, the process of introduction, <b>appropriation</b> and habituation <b>still</b> needs significant attention and investigation...|$|R
50|$|This year’s theme, Staging Reality, Documenting Fiction, {{examines}} contemporary photographers {{working in}} Africa who negotiate the boundaries and relationships between photography, beliefs, and truths. Incorporating conceptual and performative strategies that expand traditional photographic practice, many contemporary artists {{working on the}} continent move {{beyond the confines of}} the photojournalistic gaze. These artists produce work that considers the complex social and political concerns that define a new Africa in the twenty-first century, and they explore how the ubiquity of images plays a vital role in how reality is constructed and articulated. Utilizing genres such as staged narratives, performance, <b>appropriation,</b> self-portraiture, and <b>still</b> life, these artists push the temporal and spatial boundaries of the photographic medium. In doing so, Staging Reality, Documenting Fiction considers how these artists imagine different futures and charter fictive worlds, using photography as a catalyst to investigate the changing realities of Africa today.|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{footprint}} (EF) {{analysis is}} an effective tool to assess ecosystem <b>appropriation,</b> but weaknesses <b>still</b> exist. In order to estimate a city's ecosystem appropriation, we made two modifications to EF: 1) including different types of freshwater area in the calculating framework; and 2) re-adjusting all equivalent factors in terms {{of different types of}} freshwater. The modifications are mainly concerned with changes in the composition of freshwater areas in EF analysis; that is, the proportion of aquaculture freshwater and tap freshwater. An assumption of 25 % of aquaculture freshwater was used to conduct a sensitivity test. It shows that variation of the proportion leads to different equivalent and yield factors for tap freshwater areas. The variations not only change the EF of freshwater but also the total EF. The modified EF calculation served to assess ecosystem appropriation in Jiangyin city in 1998. By comparing the original and the modified EF, {{it was found that the}} ecological deficit was larger (2. 19 ha per capita) in the modified calculation than in the original (2. 16 ha per capita). The original calculation is an underestimate because direct consumption of freshwater was not fully included in its calculating framework. From the modified calculation, the EF for different categories of ecosystems decreased, from fossil energy land, arable land and pasture to built-tip areas, which together occupy about 97. 58 % of the total EF. Fossil energy land occupied 68. 55 % of the total, while freshwater areas took only 0. 62 %. The main ecological deficits were from fossil energy land, arable land, pasture and marine areas. Ecological supply is lacking within Jiangyin and relies on ecosystems outside the city to survive. Ecosystem management is indispensable to optimise the efficiency of ecosystem use and to expand the biological capacity of the city. The modified EF could provide a more reasonable instrument in policy-making and implementing sustainable management of freshwater ecosystems...|$|R
