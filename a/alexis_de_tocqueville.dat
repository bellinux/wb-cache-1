5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces.

An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E

25|$|The French Revolution has {{received}} {{enormous amounts of}} historical attention, both from {{the general public and}} from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution. <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville</b> argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance.|$|E
25|$|Various {{other early}} social historians and economists have gained {{recognition}} as classical sociologists, including Robert Michels (1876–1936), <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville</b> (1805–1859), Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) and Thorstein Veblen (1857–1926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from political philosophy {{in the attempt}} to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or dialectical, rather than purely moral, normative or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.|$|E
25|$|Several {{well-known}} {{figures have}} been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine,Pierre Gunther, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer François Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville,</b> French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.|$|E
50|$|The work, which {{appeared}} before <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> Democracy in America (La Démocratie en Amérique, 1835-39) {{in most cases}} idealizes American society as one based on social equality and justice, {{the realization of the}} ideas of Classical liberalism, an example worth following. The praise of American society is at once a critique of the Hungarian one. Bölöni Farkas attributes great importance to public education, to the press and non-governmental organizations.|$|R

5000|$|Custine {{eventually}} {{discovered that}} his knack was for travel writing. He wrote a decently received {{account of a}} trip to Spain and was encouraged by Honoré de Balzac to write accounts of other [...] "half-European" [...] parts of Europe, like southern Italy and Russia. In the late 1830s, <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> Democracy in America appeared, whose last chapter contained the prophecy that the future belonged to Russia and America. With that, Custine decided that Russia would be his next writing effort. Custine was later dubbed by some historians [...] "the <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville</b> of Russia".|$|R
25|$|The French {{writer and}} {{traveler}} <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville,</b> in Democracy in America (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing {{its effects on}} American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the south, were bringing the white and black populations {{to a state of}} equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.|$|E

When the revolutionaries wanted to reduce the Church's influence, people of the Vendée region considered this unimaginable.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{previous}} liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole {{in which all}} individuals {{have a duty to}} promote the common good. His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and John A. Hobson. In a few years, this New Liberalism had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain, and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand suffrage rights, liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the democratic decision-making process were liable to the tyranny of the majority, a concept explained in Mill's On Liberty and in Democracy in America (1835) by <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville.</b> As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the rights of minorities.|$|E
5000|$|The Tocqueville {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} that, as social conditions and opportunities improve, social frustration grows more quickly. The effect {{is based on}} <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> observations on the French Revolution and later reforms in Europe and the United States. Another way to describe the effect is the aphorism [...] "the appetite grows by what it feeds on". For instance, after greater social justice is achieved, {{there may be more}} fervent opposition to even smaller social injustices than before.|$|R
2500|$|The waterfalls {{are one of}} America's oldest tourist attractions, being {{depicted}} or {{described by}} many books, essays, poems and paintings of the early 19th century. Long before <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> famous essay on America, Kaaterskill Falls was lauded {{as a place where}} a traveler could see a wilder image, a sort of primeval Eden. Beginning with Thomas Cole's first visit during 1825, they became a subject for painters of the Hudson River School, setting the wilderness ideal for American landscape painting. The Falls also inspired [...] "Catterskill Falls", a poem by William Cullen Bryant.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} argue that while there is some {{innovation}} in BEPS, {{it is in fact}} more of a continuation that a sharp break with the past.

In particular, the single tax principle has formed the theoretical basis of much of the international tax regime from the beginning. And it is in fact this continuity rather than any sharp change that gives the final BEPS package its promise to, as Secretary General Gurria also promised, “put an end to double non-taxation. ...|$|R
