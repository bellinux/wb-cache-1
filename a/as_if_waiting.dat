500|$|Some, perhaps {{overwhelmed}} by it all, {{made no attempt}} to escape and stayed in their cabins or congregated in prayer in the third-class dining room. Leading Fireman Charles Hendrickson saw crowds of third-class passengers below decks with their trunks and possessions, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> for someone to direct them. Psychologist Wynn Craig Wade attributes this to [...] "stoic passivity" [...] produced by generations of being told what to do by social superiors. August Wennerström, one of the male steerage passengers to survive, commented later that many of his companions had made no effort to save themselves. He wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington has a {{whimsical}} statue of Stevenson, {{sitting on a}} bench with his feet propped on his briefcase and his head in one hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> for his flight. He is depicted wearing shoes that had a hole in the sole, from having walked many miles during his election campaign. [...] The shoe had become a symbol of his campaign.|$|E

"In design it is {{a simple}} granite block, as massive as a dolmen, but {{surrounded}} by a corona of bronze lances that are models of the original lances. ... hey are depicted in a resting position, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> to be seized at any instant and brought into battle. The sense of suspended action before the moment of the battle is all the more potent because it is rendered in stone and metal, making it perpetual. Of the hundreds of monuments at Gettysburg, Furness's is among the most haunting." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} accumulate use, multiple colors of highlighting and different thicknesses of underlining often occur, sometimes {{making it difficult to}} determine which portion of the evidence was read. If debaters stop before finishing the underlined or highlighted portion of a card, it is considered good form to [...] "mark" [...] the card to show where one stopped reading. To otherwise misrepresent how much of a card was read—either by stopping early or by skipping underlined or highlighted sections—is known as [...] "cross-reading" [...] or [...] "clipping" [...] which is generally considered cheating. Although many judges overtly condemn the practice on their paradigms, it is hard to enforce, especially if judges permit debaters to be excessively unclear. Opponents will generally stand behind a debater whom they believe to be cross-reading or clipping, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> to take a card (see below), and silently read along with them in an attempt to get their opponent to stop or the judge to notice.|$|E
2500|$|Life in the Resistance {{was highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and it was}} imperative for a good résistant to live quietly and never attract attention to themselves. Punctuality was key to meetings in public as the Germans would arrest anyone who was seen hanging around in public <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>waiting</b> for someone. A major difficulty for the Resistance was the problem of denunciation. Contrary to popular belief, the Gestapo was not an omnipotent agency with its spies everywhere, but instead the Gestapo relied upon ordinary people to volunteer information. According to the Abwehr officer Hermann Bickler, the Germans needed 32 000 indicateurs (informers) to crush all resistance in France, but he reported {{in the fall of}} 1940 that the Abwehr had already exceeded that target. It was difficult for Germans to pass themselves off as French, so the Abwehr, the Gestapo and the SS could not have functioned without French informers. In September 1940, the poet Robert Desnos published an article titled [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] in the underground newspaper Aujourd'hui appealing to ordinary French people to stop denouncing each other to the Germans. Desnos's appeal failed, but the phrase [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] ("I'll go and tell the Germans about it") was a very popular one in occupied France as hundreds of thousands of ordinary French people denounced each other to the Germans. The problem of what the French called indics or mouches as informers were known was compounded by the corbeaux (poison pen letters). The writers of the corbeaux was inspired by a mixture of motivations such as envy, spite, greed, anti-Semitism, and sheer opportunism as many ordinary French people wanted to ingratiate themselves with what they believed to be the winning side. Ousby noted [...] "Yet perhaps the most striking testimony to the extent of denunciation came from the Germans themselves, surprised at how ready the French were to betray each other". The problem of denunciation was always the most serious handicap for the resistance as there were a seemingly endless number of ordinary French people who were desperate to denounce anyone they suspected of engaging in resistance. In occupied France, one had to carry at all times a huge cache of documents such as an ID card, a ration card, tobacco voucher (regardless if one was a smoker or not), travel permits, work permits, and so on. For these reasons, forgery become a key skill for the resistance as the Germans regularly required the French to produce their papers, and anyone whose papers seemed suspicious would be arrested.|$|E

60|$|Then fell a great silence, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>waited</b> some word of doom. A {{multitude}} of eyes timidly stole {{back and forth}} from the Emperor to me and from me to the Emperor. And I had wit to keep the silence and to stand there, arms folded, haughty and remote.|$|R

6000|$|For {{many hours}} the {{immediate}} vicinity of the low framework upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats.

6000|$|... "You've {{been like}} an angel beside my bed. You know {{they talk about the}} angel of death. It's the most {{beautiful}} of all. You've been like that; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were <b>waiting</b> for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Antonio was in evident haste.

Antonio drew his companions into the shelter of a bush till they should pass.|$|R
