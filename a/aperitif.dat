5|$|The <b>apéritif</b> {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an <b>apéritif,</b> accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|The juice {{forms the}} basis for various popular cordials, juice drinks, juices and smoothies. Typically blended with apple or other red fruits, it is also mixed with {{pomegranate}} and grape juice. Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the <b>apéritif</b> liqueur crème de cassis, {{which in turn is}} added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale.|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an <b>Apéritif).</b> It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E

25|$|For an <b>aperitif,</b> {{flavoured}} {{dry wine}} or sparkling wine goes with all meals. Specialists in tasting {{consider that the}} sugar or alcohol in some wines has a saturating effect on the taste buds, by contrast the fruity liveliness awakens them to the meal to come.|$|E

25|$|Madeira is a {{fortified}} wine {{made in the}} portuguese Madeira Islands, {{off the coast of}} Africa. Madeira is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an <b>aperitif</b> to sweet wines usually consumed with dessert. Cheaper cooking versions are often flavoured with salt and pepper for use in cooking, but these are not fit for consumption as a beverage.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Karen MacNeil {{notes that}} most well made {{examples}} of Provençal wine have flavors and aromas {{that reflect the}} garrigue landscape of the region which includes wild lavender, rosemary and thyme. The rosés of the region are normally dry with zestiness derived from their acidity. The red and whites are characterized by their full bodies and intense aromatics. The nature and impression of the wines change significantly depending on whether they are consumed as an <b>apéritif</b> or paired with food, particularly the traditional flavors of Provençal cuisine. The rosé wine in particular is noted {{for its ability to}} pair well with garlic based dishes, such as aioli.|$|E
25|$|Beaujolais wine can be {{paired with}} a variety of food {{according}} to the lightness and body of the wine. Beaujolais Nouveau is typically used as an <b>apéritif</b> with basic Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages doing well with light fare, like picnics and salads. The lighter Cru Beaujolais pair well with poultry and the heavier Crus pairing better with red meats and hearty dishes like stews. In Norway, Beaujolais is a favorite with cod and bacalhau dishes. According to Lyon chef Paul Bocuse, Beaujolais wine is used to make a traditional regional dessert involving a glass of sliced peaches, topped with blackcurrants and drenched in chilled Beaujolais wine.|$|E
25|$|Most Madeira is {{consumed}} as wine. Popular uses include <b>apéritifs</b> (pre-meal) and digestifs (post-meal). In Britain it {{has traditionally been}} associated with Madeira cake.|$|R

25|$|They {{also share}} traits {{with the work}} of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant who {{together}} had founded Purism, a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the impulsiveness of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, Léger's Nude on a Red Background (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. The Siphon of 1924, a still life based on an advertisement in the popular press for the <b>aperitif</b> Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in Léger's work. Its balanced composition and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.|$|E
500|$|Before a meal, {{the stomach}} would preferably be [...] "opened" [...] with an <b>apéritif</b> (from Latin aperire, [...] "to open") that was preferably {{of a hot}} and dry nature: {{confections}} made from sugar- or honey-coated spices like ginger, caraway and seeds of anise, fennel or cumin, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be [...] "closed" [...] {{at the end of}} the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a dragée, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or hypocras, a wine flavoured with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese. A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, purslane, herbs, moist fruits, light meats, such as chicken or goat kid, with potages and broths. After that came the [...] "heavy" [...] meats, such as pork and beef, as well as vegetables and nuts, including pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest. It was popular, and recommended by medical expertise, to finish the meal with aged cheese and various digestives.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{and writers}} {{disagree}} on the strategic significance of the battle, although most describe it as a British tactical and operational success. In 1919, Ludendorff wrote that the British victory cost the German army dear and drained German reserves. Hindenburg wrote that the losses at Messines had been [...] "very heavy" [...] and that he regretted that the ground had not been evacuated; in 1922, Kuhl called {{it one of the}} worst German tragedies of the war. In 1920 Haig's Dispatches described the success of the British plan, organisation and results but refrained from hyperbole, referring to the operation as a successful preliminary to the main offensive at Ypres. In 1930, Liddell Hart thought the success at Messines inflated expectations for the Third Battle of Ypres and that because the circumstances of the operations were different, attempts to apply similar tactics resulted in failure. In 1938 Lloyd George called the battle an <b>apéritif</b> and in 1939, G. C. Wynne judged it to be a [...] "brilliant success", overshadowed by the subsequent tragedy of the Battles of Passchendaele. The Official Historian called it a [...] "great victory" [...] in 1948 and Prior and Wilson (1997) called the battle a [...] "noteworthy success" [...] but then complained about the decision to postpone exploitation of the success on the Gheluvelt plateau. Ashley Ekins referred to the battle as a great set-piece victory, which was also costly, particularly for the infantry of II Anzac Corps, as did Christopher Pugsley, referring to the experience of the New Zealand Division. Heinz Hagenlücke called it a great British success and wrote that the loss of the ridge, had a worse effect on German morale than the number of casualties. Jack Sheldon called it a [...] "significant victory" [...] for the British and a [...] "disaster" [...] for the German army, which was forced into a [...] "lengthy period of anxious waiting". Brown in 1996 and Simpson in 2001 concluded that extending British supply routes over the ridge, which had been devastated by the mines and millions of shells, to consolidate the Oosttaverne line and completion of the infrastructure further north in the Fifth Army area, was necessary before the Northern Operation (Third Battle of Ypres) could begin and was the main reason for the operational pause in June and July.|$|E
5|$|In French cuisine, {{beverages}} that precede a meal {{are called}} <b>apéritifs</b> (literally: {{that opens the}} appetite), and can be served with amuse-bouches (literally: mouth amuser). Those that end it are called digestifs.|$|R

2500|$|The caravan was at {{its height}} between 1930 and the mid-1960s, before {{television}} and especially television advertising was established in France. Advertisers competed to attract public attention. Motorcycle acrobats performed for the Cinzano <b>apéritif</b> company and a toothpaste maker, and an accordionist, Yvette Horner, {{became one of the}} most popular sights as she performed on the roof of a Citroën Traction Avant. The modern Tour restricts the excesses to which advertisers are allowed to go but at first anything was allowed. The writer Pierre Bost lamented: [...] "This caravan of 60 gaudy trucks singing across the countryside the virtues of an <b>apéritif,</b> a make of underpants or a dustbin is a shameful spectacle.

2500|$|The still white {{wines are}} either dry, medium dry, or medium sweet, {{depending}} {{on the amount of}} sunshine the grapes have absorbed.

The dry wines should be served at 10nbsp&°C with fish and seafood, while the medium dry wines are better suited to fish prepared with a sauce or to cooked and cured meats. The medium sweet wines go particularly well with foie gras and desserts. Alternatively they can be served as an <b>aperitif.</b> On average they can be kept for between 2 and 5 years.|$|E
