5|$|A film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Doctor Strange was initially listed as being in development at New World Pictures, with <b>a</b> <b>script</b> dated January 21, 1986 by Bob Gale. For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production. By 1989, Alex Cox had co-written <b>a</b> <b>script</b> with Doctor Strange co-creator Stan Lee. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain Dormammu on Easter Island, Chile. A film using this script was almost made by Regency, but the company's films were distributed by Warner Bros. at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising. By December 1992, Wes Craven had signed to write and direct Doctor Strange for release in either 1994 or 1995, with Savoy Pictures distributing. In 1995, David S. Goyer had completed <b>a</b> <b>script</b> for the film. By April 1997, Columbia Pictures had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch {{was working on a}} new screenplay, with Bernie Brillstein and Brad Grey producing.|$|E
