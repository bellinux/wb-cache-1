25|$|In several papers, Alan Scott Rau of the University of Texas {{law school}} {{has gone to}} a greater extent than Fortas did in {{grounding}} Prima Paint and the separability doctrine. He notes that challenges to the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> are often inseparable from the underlying claim, and that some public policy objectives may be better served by allowing the case to be heard by an arbitrator first. Conversely, he also notes that some challenges to a contract's formation necessarily include a challenge to the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> in any event, contrary to some recent lower-court decisions.|$|E
25|$|The lending {{agreements}} {{called for}} all disputes between the borrower and lender {{to be settled}} in arbitration. The original plaintiffs argued that the entire contract, including the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause,</b> was invalid because it violated the law. When it was appealed to the High Court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote {{for a majority of}} seven that the Federal Arbitration Act, as previously interpreted by the Court, settled a question that had long been debated by legal scholars and lower-court judges. The opinion distinguished void and voidable contracts, requiring that in the latter an arbitrator rule on all issues including the legality of the contract unless the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> was itself challenged. The only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who restated his belief that the Arbitration Act does not supersede state law.|$|E

40|$|Purporting {{to serve}} justice, efficiency, {{and freedom of}} contract, {{business}} interests are increasingly attempting to use binding <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> to secure unfair advantages over unknowing parties.

This article discusses courts’ enforcement of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> undermining protections to the franchisee, and how franchisees can create a more level playing field...|$|R
40|$|Our {{empirical}} {{study examines}} {{the role and}} importance of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in standard form contracts, primarily with other businesses. While {{much has been written}} about the impact of mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in consumer contracts, relatively little has been written on mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in customer agreements where the customer was a business and not an individual consumer. In this Article, we specifically address the findings presented in Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey Miller, and Emily Sherwin’s study, Arbitration’s Summer Soldiers: An Empirical Study of <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Clauses</b> in Consumer and Nonconsumer Contracts. 1 Our study finds that many businesses employ mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in their customer contracts with other businesses. Our study also suggests that the primary reason for mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in customer contracts where the customer is a business is the avoidance of expenses associated with litigation. Our study may help companies to better understand attitudes about arbitration and assist in contract negotiations. The results of our study may also help courts determine whether <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in merchant form agreements––and changes to those clauses––are “material” under section 2 - 207 (2) of the Uniform Commercial Code...|$|R
25|$|If the {{contract}} contains a valid <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim {{in accordance with}} the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts.|$|E
25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause.</b> But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E
25|$|The {{former is}} {{the far more}} {{prevalent}} type of arbitration agreement. Sometimes, legal significance attaches {{to the type of}} arbitration agreement. For example, in certain Commonwealth countries (not including England and Wales), it is possible to provide that each party should bear their own costs in a conventional <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause,</b> but not in a submission agreement.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{data set}} of 2, 858 {{contracts}} contained as exhibits in Form 8 -K filings by reporting corporations over a six month period in 2002 for twelve types of contracts and a seven month period in 2002 for merger contracts. Because 8 -K filings are required only for material events, these contracts likely are carefully negotiated by sophisticated parties who are well-informed about the contract terms. These contracts, therefore, {{provide evidence of}} efficient ex ante solutions to contracting problems. The vast majority of contracts did not require arbitration. Only about 11 percent of the contracts included binding <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses.</b> The rate of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> varied substantially by type of contract. For example, pooling and servicing agreements and trust agreements had no <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> while employment and licensing contracts had {{the highest rate of}} <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> 37 percent and 33 percent respectively. <b>Arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> are strongly negatively associated with standardization of contract terms: the more standardized the contract, the less likely it will mandate arbitration of disputes. Contracts with California connections tended to have high rates of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> while contracts with New York connections tended to have low rates of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses.</b> <b>Arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} appear in contracts with international connections, but even in such contracts, the clauses were infrequent in absolute terms. Only 20 percent of international contracts contained <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> compared to ten percent of domestic contracts. Our results suggest, in contracts involving two sophisticated actors, that the parties perceive preserving access to litigation to be value-enhancing compared to ex ante binding arbitration. This contrasts with widespread beliefs about arbitration’s efficiency and with imposition of mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in some standardized consumer transactions such as credit card and cellular phone contracts...|$|R

Our empirical findings reveal that SNS <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> contravene many of the basic principles deemed indispensable for a fundamentally fair process for consumers to obtain civil recourse for recognized torts and remedies for contract disputes.

5000|$|Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller, and Emily Sherwin {{said that}} none of the {{contracts}} they researched had standalone waivers of class actions without <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> because, outside of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> class action waivers [...] "are legally vulnerable and also politically controversial".|$|R
25|$|In McMahon, the {{defendant}} had sought arbitration of claims not only under the 1934 Act {{but the more}} recent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). By a 5–4 margin the Court ruled for them, enforcing the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> in the plaintiffs' customer agreement. In a reversal of its longstanding position, the SEC filed an amicus supporting arbitration.|$|E
25|$|The FAA made {{no impact}} on the federal courts until the 1958 Second Circuit {{decision}} in Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., which held that the requirement to arbitrate meant that any challenge to the contract itself had to go before an arbitrator, not just disputes over possible breaches of contract. Only the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> itself could be challenged in court first.|$|E
25|$|In AT Mobility v. Concepcion (2011), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld an <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> in a {{consumer}} standard form contract which waived {{the right to}} a lawsuit and class action. However, this clause was relatively generous in that the business paid all fees unless the action was determined to be frivolous and a small-claims court action remained available; these types of protections are recommended for the contract to remain enforceable and not unconscionable.|$|E
50|$|Bills {{have been}} {{proposed}} that would carve out some disputes from {{the applicability of the}} FAA, nullifying <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> as applied to those disputes. The first example of such a carve-out was the Motor Vehicle Franchise Arbitration Act, signed into law in 2002, which nullified <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in car dealership franchise contracts. Subsequent legislation carved-out disputes involving high-interest loans to military members, poultry and livestock farmers, and defense contractors bringing claims about civil rights or alleged sexual assault. In 2014 Barack Obama issued an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from enforcing <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> against employees bringing civil rights claims or alleging sexual assault.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Demaine and Hensler {{wrote that}} 16 of 52 <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> {{examined}} contained class action waivers, and none expressly permitted class arbitration.

According to the preliminary results of the CFPB's arbitration study, released in 2013, 93.9% of unique credit card contracts that contained <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> representing 99.9% of the credit card market where contracts contain <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> had explicit class action waivers.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a study of contractual practices by well-known firms marketing consumer products, comparing the firms 2 ̆ 7 consumer contracts with contracts the same firms negotiated with business peers. The frequency of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in consumer contracts has been studied before, as has the frequency of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in non-consumer contracts. Our study {{is the first to}} compare the use of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> within firms, in different contractual contexts. The results are striking: in our sample, mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> appeared in more than three-quarters of consumer contracts and less than one tenth of non-consumer contracts (excluding employment contracts) negotiated by the same firms. This suggests that the firms 2 ̆ 7 faith in arbitration is considerably weaker than they have claimed. For the purpose of business-to-business disputes, in which they may be either plaintiffs or defendants, they prefer the option to litigate in court...|$|R
25|$|Mitsubishi's {{response}} was {{a motion to}} the judge to compel arbitration as mandated by the agreement. The court ordered most of the contractual claims arbitrated, but reserved jurisdiction on the statutory claims alleged by Soler, including antitrust. Soler made an interlocutory appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes Puerto Rico, arguing that all its statutory counterclaims were {{not covered by the}} <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause,</b> and that Sherman Act claims could not be arbitrated in any event.|$|E
25|$|Richard J. Cardamone {{wrote for}} a panel that {{followed}} Mitsbushis analysis: first holding the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> valid, then inquiring into whether the claims came under its scope. Since, as the Mitsubishi majority had found, the alleged bad acts {{arose from the}} activities covered by the contract, all save the RICO and tortious interference claims were arbitrable. It told the district court to stay even the RICO claims, however, pending the outcome of McMahon at the Supreme Court (which ruled them arbitrable).|$|E
25|$|The Court {{announced}} its decision in July, {{near the end}} of term. Harry Blackmun wrote for a five-justice majority that affirmed the First Circuit's holding that the statutory claims were arbitrable and reversed it by holding the antitrust claims arbitrable as well. John Paul Stevens' lengthy dissent argued primarily that the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> was inapplicable to the dispute, and the precedent against arbitrating antitrust claims was far stronger than the majority represented it to be. Justice Lewis Powell took no part in the case.|$|E
40|$|In {{a string}} of recent opinions, the Supreme Court has made it harder for {{consumers}} to avoid <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> even when businesses strategically insert provisions in them that effectively prevent consumers {{from being able to}} bring any claim in any forum. Arbitration differs from litigation in ways that harm the interests of consumer antitrust plaintiffs. For example, arbitration limits discovery and has no meaningful appeals process. Furthermore, defendants use the terms in <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> to prevent class actions and to undercut the pro-plaintiff features of antitrust law, including mandatory treble damages, meaningful injunctive relief, recovery of attorneys’ fees, and a lengthy statute of limitations. The problems associated with antitrust arbitration are magnified in concentrated markets. Supporters of enforcing <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> assume that they these contractual provisions are the result of an informed, voluntary bargain. But when a market is dominated by a single supplier or a small group of firms, consumers often find it impossible to purchase a necessary product while retaining the right to sue, especially since <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> are generally embedded in contracts of adhesion. This means that in the markets most likely to be affected by antitrust violations, consumers are least {{likely to be able to}} avoid mandatory <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses.</b> Antitrust authorities can address the problem of proliferating <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses.</b> We argue that antitrust officials should condition merger approval on the merging parties’ agreement to not require arbitration of antitrust claims...|$|R

25|$|In 1983 a {{three-judge panel}} of Levin H. Campbell, then the circuit's chief judge, Frank M. Coffin and Hugh Henry Bownes, heard the case. Near {{the end of the}} year they handed down their decision. Unanimously they ruled for Mitsubishi on the {{statutory}} claims, holding them within the ambit of the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause.</b> However, they also said, the Sherman Act claims could be litigated as they were not so parochial to American law, and were too important to U.S. public policy to leave to arbitrators.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} concerning arbitration of antitrust claims. The Court {{heard the}} case on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which had ruled that the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> in a Puerto Rican car dealer's franchise agreement was broad enough to reach its antitrust claim. By a 5–3 margin it upheld the lower court, requiring that the dealer arbitrate its claim before a panel in Tokyo, as stipulated in the contract.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{filed an}} interlocutory {{appeal to the}} Second Circuit, which heard oral arguments in the case {{near the end of}} the year. Chief Judge Thomas Walter Swan (no relation to defendant) was joined on the panel by Harrie Brigham Chase and Charles Edward Clark. They handed down their split decision early the following year. Swan and Chase had agreed, overturning the district court and holding the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> enforceable. Clark agreed with Goddard that the underlying policy considerations precluded that outcome, and did not require the specificity the majority demanded.|$|E
5000|$|The judge {{continued}} that “the District Court recognized… {{the distinction}} our Court has drawn between <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in individual contracts… and <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in bargaining agreements.” The former, he wrote, was “governed by {{a line of}} Supreme Court cases represented by Gilmer v.

5000|$|The Concepcion {{decision}} also impacted {{the usage}} of <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> in consumer contracts, including {{the usage of}} [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] arbitration terms like the ones in AT&T's agreement. Jean Sternlight said that the Concepcion decision would cause businesses to include <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> with class action waivers, saying that the Concepcion decision removed the possibility of [...] "costly litigation" [...] over whether such terms are enforceable. In a 2012 research paper, Gilles wrote that the majority opinion in Concepcion led to a [...] "race to the top" [...] in implementing arbitration procedures that are more friendly to consumer claims {{and more likely to}} allow their vindication. Gilles wrote that corporate lawyers encouraged companies to implement terms similar to the ones used by AT&T Mobility and upheld in Concepcion. According to Gilles, many large consumer-oriented businesses changed their arbitration provisions in 2011 and 2012. However, Gilles noted that only 6 out of the 37 companies she examined had <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> that [...] "offered anything close to AT&T's set of incentives, and none were quite as generous". Ann Marie Tracey and Shelley McGill wrote that businesses would introduce more consumer-unfriendly terms in their <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses</b> since unconscionability [...] "provided strong motivation for business to draft agreements fairly in the pre-Concepcion environment; that motivation does not exist in the post-Concepcion era." [...] Suzanna Sherry said that the broad holding of the decision would make harsh <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> similar to the earliest consumer <b>arbitration</b> <b>clauses,</b> enforceable, since the unconscionability doctrine that had been used to strike down those harsh clauses could be found preempted based on Concepcion.|$|R

25|$|Arguably, either {{position}} is potentially unfair; {{if a person}} is made to sign a contract under duress, and the contract contains an <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal. Conversely a court may be persuaded that the arbitration agreement itself is void having been signed under duress. However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to go to court to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.|$|E

Mrs. McNulty, a broker {{with what was}} then Shearson/American Express, persuaded Mrs. McMahon to invest not only their personal savings but also their employee's retirement and profit sharing funds with her company. Two years later, McNulty persuaded the McMahons to sign power of attorney forms allowing Shearson to make trades without their consent. Those standard form contracts contained an <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> committing either party to use that method of resolving disputes.|$|E
25|$|The case {{arose from}} a claim by a New Jersey {{manufacturer}} that a Maryland firm had misrepresented {{itself in a}} transaction and thus the contract between the two was unenforceable, precluding the arbitration agreed upon {{in the event of}} a dispute. Abe Fortas wrote for a 6-3 majority that the FAA was broad enough to require arbitration of all issues save the <b>arbitration</b> <b>clause</b> itself. Hugo Black's dissent called the majority's interpretation overbroad and at odds with Congressional intent in passing the law. He feared it would put legal matters in the hands of arbitrators with little or no legal understanding of it nor duty to follow the law.|$|E
