I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

25|$|The adult beluga {{is rarely}} mistaken {{for any other}} species, because it is {{completely}} white or whitish-grey in colour. Calves are usually born grey, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are a month old, have turned dark grey or blue grey. They then start to progressively lose their pigmentation until they attain their distinctive white colouration, {{at the age of}} seven years in females and 9 in males. The white colouration of the skin is an adaptation to life in the Arctic that allows belugas to camouflage themselves in the polar ice caps as protection against their main predators, polar bears and killer whales. Unlike other cetaceans, the belugas seasonally shed their skin. During the winter, the epidermis thickens and the skin can become yellowish, mainly on the back and fins. When they migrate to the estuaries during the summer, they rub themselves on the gravel of the riverbeds to remove the cutaneous covering.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} Oxford boat {{overlapped}} their opponents yet Cambridge pushed away again before Chiswick Eyot where the Dark Blues once began to overlap the Light Blues' stern. [...] Cambridge's stroke Lawes reacted and pushed {{to keep the}} lead, but by Chiswick Church the crews were level. [...] Oxford's better line in the river saw them draw away rapidly from Cambridge, whereupon the Light Blues were regarded as [...] "falling to pieces". [...] Oxford's lead at Barnes Bridge was around three lengths, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> passed the finishing line they had won by four lengths {{in a time of}} 21 minutes 24 seconds, securing the Dark Blue's fifth consecutive win and taking the overall record to 1210 in their favour.

500|$|With {{but a few}} notable exceptions, the {{interiors}} of the palazzi were from the start less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were finished without ornate interior decoration, simply because they {{took so long to}} build <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were completed Baroque had passed from fashion; the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style known as [...] "Pompeian". Often one can find a fusion of the two styles, as in the ballroom wing of the Palazzo Aiutamicristo in Palermo, built by Andrea Giganti in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Cristadoro with allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster. This ceiling was already old-fashioned when it was finished, {{and the rest of the}} room was decorated in a far simpler mode. Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their interiors lost.|$|E
500|$|The kingdom was {{sometimes}} threatened by nomads; a letter sent to Yasmah-Adad informs him that 2000 Suteans conducted a raid against Qatna. Relations with Yamhad worsened during Išḫi-Addu's reign and the conflict evolved into border warfare; Qatna occupied {{the city of}} Parga {{in the region of}} Hamath for a while before Sumu-Epuh retook it. In the south, Išḫi-Addu faced a general rebellion; the alliance with Assyria was cemented by the marriage of Išḫi-Addu's daughter to Yasmah-Adad in [...] The following year, after petitions by Qatna, Shamshi-Adad sent an army to help Išḫi-Addu deal with the rebellion. The Assyrian troops avoided engaging Yamhad and did not participate in its war with Qatna, while Išḫi-Addu took up residence in Qadeš to oversee the suppression of the rebellion, which apparently was supported by Yamhad. After four years in the service of Qatna, Shamshi-Adad ordered his troops to return; this might have been connected to a peace treaty between Assyria and Yarim-Lim I, son of Sumu-Epuh. Išḫi-Addu, who in the past had declared that [...] "even if Shamshi-Adad would conclude peace with Sumu-epuh, I will never make peace with Sumu-epuh, as long as I live!", was delivered a heavy blow, but Mari's sources are silent on how the king dealt with the situation, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> resumed mentioning Qatna in , Išḫi-Addu was dead and succeeded by his son Amut-piʾel II.|$|E

500|$|Intelligent {{steering}} from C. G. F. Bryan, the Oxford cox, saw the Dark Blues [...] "hugging the Surrey bank" [...] {{to reduce}} the Cambridge lead to about a length by Chiswick Eyot. [...] It was short-lived however, as Bryan steered back over towards the Middlesex side of the river, losing his crew a length in doing so and moving into rougher water, and by Chiswick Steps, the Light Blues were {{four and a half}} lengths ahead. [...] Cambridge's stroke Ran Laurie called for a spurt <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> passed under Barnes Bridge they were five lengths ahead. [...] They crossed to the Middlesex side of the river before passing the finishing post with a lead of four and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 48 seconds. [...] It was a record twelfth victory for the Light Blues and took the overall record in the event to 46–40 in their favour. [...] Former Oxford rower E. P. Evans, writing in The Manchester Guardian, stated that Cambridge [...] "won in the easiest manner possible, having led from start to finish" [...] and described the race as a [...] "fiasco". [...] The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested that [...] "never was it so obvious after the first few strokes that there was only one crew in the race ... Oxford's form was too bad to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew {{had a lot of time}} on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chorus of}} the song {{includes}} the line [...] "The boys of the NYPD choir still singing 'Galway Bay'".

The NYPD Pipes and Drums did not know [...] "Galway Bay" [...] and so sang a song that all of them knew the words to – the [...] "Mickey Mouse March", the theme tune for The Mickey Mouse Club television series. The footage was then slowed down and shown in brief sections to disguise the fact the Pipes and Drums were singing a different song. Murray recalled that the Pipes and Drums had been drinking on the coach that brought them to the video shoot, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> arrived they were more drunk than the band, refusing to work unless they were supplied with more alcohol.|$|E
