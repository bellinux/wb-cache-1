60|$|It {{is exactly}} this unmilitant {{quality in the}} Suffragettes that makes their {{superficial}} problem. The problem is that their action has none {{of the advantages of}} ultimate violence; it does not afford a test. War is a dreadful thing; but it does prove two points sharply and unanswerably--numbers, and an unnatural valor. One does discover the two urgent matters; how many rebels there are alive, and how many are ready to be dead. But a tiny minority, even an interested minority, may maintain mere disorder forever. There is also, of course, in the case of these women, the further falsity that is introduced by their sex. It is false to state the matter as a mere brutal question of strength. If his muscles give a man a vote, then his horse ought to have two votes and his elephant five votes. The truth is more subtle than that; it is that bodily outbreak is a man's instinctive weapon, like the hoofs to the horse or the tusks to the elephant. All riot is a threat of war; but the woman is brandishing a weapon she can never use. There are many weapons that she could and does use. If (for example) all the women nagged for a vote they would get it in a month. But there again, one must remember, it would be necessary to get all the women to nag. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> {{to the end of the}} political surface of the matter. The working objection to the Suffragette philosophy is simply that overmastering millions of women do not agree with it. I am aware that some maintain that women ought to have votes whether the majority wants them or not; but this is surely a strange and childish case of setting up formal democracy to the destruction of actual democracy. What should the mass of women decide if they do not decide their general place in the State? These people practically say that females may vote about everything except about Female Suffrage.|$|E

40|$|I feel {{somewhat}} constrained {{in attempting}} {{to focus on the}} topic of theories of mathematical learning, for I am unable to separate matters of learning from matters of reasoning. I suppose this is for two reasons. First, in talking about learning, we immediately bump into the question “Learn what?”, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> into the arena of concepts, methods, schemes, and so forth that learners always express within occasions of reasoning. Second, any cognitive theory I know of postulates that learning happens by way of action—some theories focus on habituation of overt behavior, some focus on assimilation and accommodation, others focus on compilation of propositions. These various theories ’ constructs all call for explicit attention to events that occasion learning; I tend to think of such events as necessarily entailing students ’ reasoning in the context of problems. So, in addressing the issue of mathematical learning I find it rewarding to orient the discussion toward the development of mathematical reasoning—purposeful inference, deduction, induction, and association in the areas of quantity and structure. The idea I put forward is this: Mathematical reasoning at all levels is firmly grounded in imagery. I ought to say something about what I mean by imagery and why I take interest in imagery. This will take a while. IMAGERY By “image ” I mean much more than a mental picture. Rather, I have in mind an image as being constituted by experiential fragments from kinesthesis, proprioception, smell, touch, taste, vision, or hearing. It seems essential also to include the possibility that images can entail fragments of past affective experiences, such as fearing, enjoying, or puzzling, and fragments of past cognitive experiences, such as judging, deciding...|$|E

We first study the theoretical time com-plexity of minimal siphon decision problems in general Petri nets, and present three new complexity results: first, we show that the existence of a siphon of a given cardinality is NP-complete; second, we prove that deciding the Siphon-Trap property is co-NP-complete; third, we prove that deciding the existence of a minimal siphon containing a given set of places, deciding the existence of a siphon of a given cardinality and deciding the Siphon-Trap property ca...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Researchers {{from the}} {{cognitive}} and spatial sciences are studying text descriptions of movement patterns {{in order to examine}} how humans communicate and understand spatial information. In particular, route directions offer a rich source of information on how cognitive systems conceptualize movement patterns by segmenting them into meaningful parts. Route directions are composed using a plethora of cognitive spatial organization principles: changing levels of granularity, hierarchical organization, incorporation of cognitively and perceptually salient elements, and so forth. Identifying such information in text documents automatically is crucial for enabling machine-understanding of human spatial language. The benefits are: a) creating opportunities for large-scale studies of human linguistic behavior; b) extracting and georeferencing salient entities (landmarks) that are used by human route direction providers; c) developing methods to translate route directions to sketches and maps; and d) enabling queries on large corpora of crawled/analyzed movement data. In this paper, we introduce our approach <b>and</b> implementations <b>that</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> closer to the goal of automatically processing linguistic route directions. We report on research directed at one part of the larger problem, that is, extracting the three most critical parts of route directions and movement patterns in general: origin, destination, and route parts. We use machine-learning based algorithms to extract these parts of routes, including, for example, destination names and types.

Adorno's continuing confrontation with the "domination of nature" traces the tensions between the ideological construction and resistance of "nature" {{as well as the}} instrumentalization and implicit disruptive promise of sensuous life.

40|$|What is {{mathematical}} neuroscience? Is {{it simply}} an interdisciplinary field that aims at modelling neural processes using mathematics? Most likely {{this is a}} perfectly respectable working definition, though probably worth qualifying {{with the statement that}} it has both practical and theoretical applications in neurobiology. However, when one digs a bit deeper into the historical use of math-ematics in neuroscience it may be more useful to distinguish between computational, theoretical, and mathematical neuroscience proper.

In this field mathematics is most often used hand-in-hand with computational tools to numerically explore model behaviour. The theoretical neuroscientist is more concerned with building testable, pos-sibly metaphorical, theories for understanding the operation of neurobiological circuits.

A rapidly growing body of research in the field of evolutionary psychology has documented the importance of evolutionary forces in shaping patterns of human cognition and behavior. The process of natural selection is proposed to have shaped many behaviors that represent crimes in modern societies, such as murder, assault, rape, and theft, to address ancestrally recurrent conflicts between individuals. The cost-inflicting strategies thatwe recognize as crimesmay have been favored by natural selectionwhen they gave individuals an advantage in competition for scarce, reproductively reproductively-relevant resources. An exploration of the contexts of ancestrally recurrent conflicts for these resources and how the process of selection operates to shape adaptive strategies in individuals to best competitors can help to elucidate the nature of cognitive <b>and</b> behavioral adaptations <b>that</b> are hypothesized to produce criminal behaviors.
