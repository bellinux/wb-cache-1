40|$|ABSTRACT: Cupric oxide–chitosan {{nanocomposite}} {{was prepared}} in aqueous solution. Copper ions were adsorbed into the chitosan mainly by chelation to form copper-loaded chitosan. Copper-loaded chitosan was reduced by using sodium hydroxide at specific pH. Copper oxide nanoparticle-loaded chitosan {{was formed by}} oxidation of Cu(OH) 2 -loaded chitosan by using drops of H 2 O 2 (30 %). CuO nanoparticles-loaded chitosan molecules were stirred with a high-speed homogenizer at 10, 000 rpm for 30 minutes. The corresponding CuO/chitosan nanocomposite formed was characterized by using transmission electron microscope images. The copper oxide/chitosan nanocomposite was applied to cotton fabric by using pad-dry cure technique. Cotton fabric treated with CuO–chitosan nanocomposite was characterized via scanning electron microscope supplied with energy dispersive spectroscopy to verify the elemental composition of deposited materials on the fabric. Antimicrobial activity of the prepared fabric samples treated with chitosan nanoparticles and CuO/chitosan nanocomposites against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aurous) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) were investigated.

Although metallic mordants are effective, they are environmentally pollutants, hence not desirable. In the current work, the novel natural mordant like chitosan with different concentrations (10 % and 20 % of weight of fiber) was applied on cotton and fabric was printed with natural dyes such as catechu, turmeric, and marigold using screen printing method. All the three dyes were used in powder form in print paste with different concentrations (1 %, 5 %, and 10 %) and guar gum was used as thickener. The printed samples using chitosan as a mordant showed the equivalent color values to that of prints obtained using alum as a mordant.

30|$|Plain, twill and satin {{woven fabrics}} of cotton, {{polyester}} and polyester-cotton of 150  g/m 2 and 200  g/m 2 {{have been used}} to study their suitability for surgical gowns before and after application of flouropolymer and antibacterial finishes. Different concentration levels of fluoropolymer and antibacterial finishes were used to find the level of finishes required for different AAMI protection levels along with their durability using standard laundering cycles. It is observed that all the fabrics except 150  g/m 2 cotton fabric, can be used for AAMI protection level 1 only without any finish. The water repellence of fabrics increases on application of fluoropolymer finish. 4 % fluoropolymer finish on these fabrics {{can be used to make}} them suitable for AAMI protection level 2. Increasing fluropolymer concentration level further increases the hydrostatic pressure but does not make them suitable for protection level 3 and therefore are not recommended for critical areas of the surgical gown. Twill woven fabrics of 200  g/m 2 show highest hydrostatic pressure, but higher stiffness and low air permeability make them quite uncomfortable for longer duration usage. Satin fabrics are more comfortable offering higher air permeability and lower stiffness, but show lowest hydrostatic pressure values and therefore offer minimal water repellence. Repeated laundering cycles lead to reduction in the barrier resistance of fabrics. It is observed that 150  g/m 2 polyester and twill woven 200  g/m 2 cotton fabrics with 4 % fluoropolymer finish maintain their AAMI protection level 2 upto 20 washing cycles. Satin woven fabrics treated with 4 % fluoropolymer finish can maintain AAMI protection level 2 upto 5 washing cycles only. 1.5 % <b>antibacterial</b> <b>finish</b> is sufficient to inhibit the growth of S. aureus bacteria for all fabric samples and this antibacterial activity is maintained upto 20 washing cycles for all fabrics.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) Permanent press fabrics {{are popular}} {{today because of}} their easy care properties. However, {{it has not been}} verified whether or not this same finish might also act as an antibacterial agent. Therefore, this study investigated the hypothesis that permanent press finishes might stop or curtail bacterial growth on fabrics. Inoculations of two bacteria, E. Coli and B. mega on finished and unfinished fabric samples provided results for a comparative study. Some samples were inoculated and plated immediately; others were inoculated and kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours before plating to simulate storage and climatic conditions; and a third group were inoculated, kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours and then laundered in and according to suggested Launderometer standards. The samples from this last test were then either plated whole or macerated and plated. The Agar Plate Test method (AATCC test standard for detection and evaluation of antibacterial finishes) and the Streak Test method were used for another set of tests. Another segment of the study concerned naturally soiled finished and unfinished fabrics. Small samples of each fabric were sewn in regular clothing, worn one day, and then plated. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and subsequently plated showed little or no growth whereas all the unfinished samples showed considerably increased growth. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and stored for twenty-four hours in a humidity chamber before plating showed no growth while the unfinished samples all exhibited bacterial growth. Of the samples that were inoculated, stored for twenty-four hours in the humidity chamber, washed, and plated whole, all finished samples had no growth but all untreated samples showed growth. Of the washed samples that were macerated, the untreated macerated fibers showed from five to six times more growth than the permanent press samples. The Agar Plate Test and Streak Test both showed that the permanent press samples inhibited bacterial growth whereas the unfinished samples showed no inhibition of growth. On all samples of naturally soiled permanent press fabrics, the majority of samples containing bacterial growth had less growth than the unfinished samples. These results would indicate that the permanent press finish can inhibit some bacterial growth and thus may act concomitantly as an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>finish...</b>|$|E

30|$|Farouk et al. {{proposed}} {{the design of}} hybrid polymers based on nanosized ZnO particles, being a great alternative as an <b>antibacterial</b> <b>finishing</b> for textiles [56]. These hybrid materials are based on glycidiltrimethoxisilane (GPTMS) and were applied onto cotton/polyester (65 / 35  %) fabrics, using a padding process. The antimicrobial activity of the modified fabrics with a constant mass of ZnO (10  wt.%) but with a varying particle size was tested against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus). An important consideration of this work is that the fabrics treated with the hybrid polymer loaded with ZnO particles of the smaller particle size (30 – 60  nm) leads to a complete annihilation of both bacteria, while fabrics coated with hybrid polymers loaded with bigger ZnO particles (600 – 650  nm) achieve a 93 and 97  % reduction of the E. coli and M. luteus populations, respectively.

Silver nanoparticle as a broad antibacterial agent is widely used for <b>antibacterial</b> <b>finishing</b> of textiles [12, 13]. Besides antibacterial property, noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., silver and gold) possess particular localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property, which leads to bright colors. Some strategies have been developed to utilize noble metal nanoparticles to functionalize different fibers such as cotton, wool, and silk. The coloration of fibers has been achieved through treatment with silver nanoparticles, taking advantage of the LSPR optical property of noble metal nanoparticles [5, 14, 15]. Similarly, gold nanoparticles can also endow fabrics with different functions including colors, UV protection, and antibacterial properties [16 – 18].|$|R
