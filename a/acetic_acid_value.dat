In previous studies in CWBI, Acetobacter senegalensis was used for production of dried vinegar starters; however the impact of stressors (ethanol and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid)</b> on A. senegalensis remained unclear. In this study, different techniques such as flow cytometry, culturability on solid medium and 2 -DiGE were used comparatively to investigate the effect of carbon sources of inoculum media on the tolerance of A. senegalensis to stressors. Analysis of respiration system by flow cytometric methods showed {{that the presence of}} 2 % (v/v) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in inoculum medium, in one hand, causes 80 % of cells to continue to do respiration after a sudden exposure to 1 - 3 % (v/v) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in stress media while 89. 7 % of cells grown in glucose appeared as dead cells after an abrupt exposure to 3 %(v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> On the other hand, 59. 2 % and 49. 33 % of cells grown in the presence of 2 % (v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> could maintain their entire membrane integrity after exposure to 1 % and 3 % (v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. Inoculum medium contained 5 % (v/v) of ethanol as a carbon source enabled about 90 % of cells to keep their growing capacities after a sudden exposure to 3 % <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> In contrast, just 40 % of cells grown in glucose as a carbon source maintained their culturability on solid medium after exposure to 1 % <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> A similar profile of culturability was observed for the cells grown in 5 % (v/v) ethanol or 2 % (v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> A proteomic approach (2 -DiGE) was used to analyze proteins expressed in the presence of different carbon sources. Differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolisms, folding, sorting and degradation processes. The relative abundance of proteins was extensively different for cell grown in glucose compared with protein contents of cells grown in ethanol or <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> In conclusion, production of a cost effective vinegar starter needs a qualified biomass which tolerates ethanol and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Tolerance of A. senegalensis to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> depends to a great extent on the composition of the medium which cells grow in. In spite of low adaption to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> for cell grown in glucose, using ethanol or <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in inoculum media renders a physiological state in A. senegelensis which enables it to cope with higher concentration of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> readily, this biomass has a potential {{to be used as a}} starter.

The <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric <b>acid</b> to recover <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|R

Moreover, {{to increase the}} resistance towards thermal degradation, the oxidative pretreatment of kraft lignin with air was proposed [227]. Similar to kraft lignin, <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> lignin {{can be used in}} the production of CFs. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> lignin from hardwood lends facilitates the preparation of CFs more so than that from softwood. Hardwood <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> lignin could be spun via fusion spinning without any chemical modifications [228], while softwood <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was infusible. The condensed and aryl-ether structure of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> could hinder the thermal mobility [220]. To convert softwood <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> lignin into a fusible material, the removal of the high molecular weight fraction or re-cooking with aqueous <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was effective [220, 229]. CFs from softwood <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> could be prepared by direct carbonization without thermal stabilization [229]. Thermal hydrogenolysis [230] or phenolysis [231] of steam-exploded lignin from birch was conducted to improve the softening and melting properties. Olganosolv lignin also can be used for the production of CF [232].|$|R
40|$|Glycolaldehyde and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> are {{promising}} bio-based platform chemicals, {{which could be}} extracted from a wood-based pyrolysis oil-derived aqueous phase. The aim {{of this paper was}} to study the effect of the aqueous feed composition and tri-n-octylamine/ 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol concentration on the <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> extraction and glycolaldehyde co-extraction performance. In the physical and reactive extractions, glycolaldehyde and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> are extracted independently from each other. In the physical extraction, the feed composition has a slight influence on the distribution coefficients and yields of both <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> extraction and glycolaldehyde co-extraction. In the reactive extraction, the <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> extraction and glycolaldehyde co-extraction are relatively independent of the feed composition. For a combined one-step <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and glycolaldehyde extraction pure 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol solvent provides the highest yields. Although 40 wt. % tri-n-octylamine provides the best <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> extraction performance, a solvent containing more than 50 wt. % tri-n-octylamine in 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol is preferred for a two-step scenario in which <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is extracted prior to glycolaldehyde, due to the decrease of glycolaldehyde co-extraction with increasing tri-n-octylamine concentratio...|$|R
