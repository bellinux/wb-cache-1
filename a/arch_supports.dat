25|$|This type of bridge {{comprises}} an arch {{where the}} deck is completely above the arch. The {{area between the}} arch and the deck {{is known as the}} spandrel. If the spandrel is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone arch bridge, the bridge is called a closed-spandrel deck arch bridge. If the deck is supported by a number of vertical columns rising from the arch, the bridge is known as an open-spandrel deck arch bridge. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel arch bridge. Finally, if the <b>arch</b> <b>supports</b> the deck only {{at the top of the}} arch, the bridge is called a cathedral arch bridge.|$|E
500|$|The marble pyramidion has an {{extremely}} complex construction to save weight yet remain strong. Its surface slabs or panels are usually only [...] thick (with small {{thick and thin}} portions) and generally {{do not support the}} weight of slabs above them, instead transferring their own weight via [...] wide internal marble ribs to the shaft's walls. The slabs are generally [...] wide and [...] high with a [...] vertical overlap (shiplap) to prevent water from entering the horizontal joints. Twelve such courses, the internal ribs, the marble capstone, and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion. Its height is [...] [...] Its weight is [...] The slope of the walls of the pyramidion is 17°24' from the vertical. [...] There are twelve ribs, three per wall, which spring from the [...] level, all being integrated into the walls up to the [...] level. All are free standing above 500 feet, relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones. The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint, forming four corner arches. Each such <b>arch</b> <b>supports</b> a pair of square corner stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam. The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone's weight by themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Mesoamerican {{cultures}} never {{invented the}} keystone, {{and so were}} unable to build true arches, but instead all of their architecture made use of the [...] "false" [...] or Corbelled arch. These arches are built without centering and can be built without support, by corbelling regularly the horizontal courses of the wall masonry. This type of <b>arch</b> <b>supports</b> much less weight than a true arch.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insoles on uphill and downhill walking of persons with flatfoot. Sixteen healthy college students with flatfoot were recruited in this study. Their heart rate, peak oxygen uptake (VO 2), and median frequency (MDF) of surface electromyogram were recorded and analyzed. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis. The main results were as follows: (a) peak VO 2 significantly decreased with <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insoles compared with flat insoles during uphill and downhill walking (<b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insole versus flat insole: uphill walking, 20. 7 [*]±[*] 3. 6 versus 31. 6 [*]±[*] 5. 5; downhill walking, 10. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 3 versus 16. 9 [*]±[*] 4. 2); (b) <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insoles could reduce the fatigue of the rectus femoris muscle during downhill walking (MDF slope of <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insole: 0. 03 [*]±[*] 1. 17, flat insole: − 6. 56 [*]±[*] 23. 07); (c) insole hardness would increase not only the physical sensory input but also the fatigue of lower-limb muscles particularly for the rectus femoris muscle (MDF slope of <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insole: − 1. 90 [*]±[*] 1. 60, flat insole: − 0. 83 [*]±[*] 1. 10) in persons with flatfoot during uphill walking. The research results show that <b>arch</b> <b>support</b> insoles could effectively be applied to persons with flatfoot to aid them during uphill and downhill walking...|$|R

5000|$|In 1906, William J. Riley, British emigrant, {{founded the}} New Balance Arch Support Company, {{manufacturing}} <b>arch</b> <b>supports</b> and other accessories {{designed to improve}} shoe fit in the Boston area. His first product, a flexible arch support, was designed with three support points to provide greater balance and comfort in the shoe. It is believed that Riley {{came up with the}} name [...] "New Balance" [...] by observing chickens in his yard and demonstrated the way his <b>arch</b> <b>supports</b> worked by keeping a chicken foot on his office desk. He explained to customers that the chicken's three-pronged foot resulted in perfect balance. In 1927, Riley hired Arthur Hall to be a salesman. In 1934, Hall became a business partner and found his niche by marketing to people whose jobs required them {{to spend a lot of}} time standing. In 1956, Hall sold the business to his daughter Eleanor and her husband Paul Kidd.|$|E

5000|$|The upper {{church was}} built between the years 1010-1020 (at {{the same time}} as the {{expansion}} of the lower church). Its construction required the strengthening of the columns of the lower church, which were enclosed in square piles.

50|$|Like {{the flying}} arch, the {{inverted}} arch {{is not used}} to support a load, as for a bridge, but rather to resist sideways, inwards loads.
