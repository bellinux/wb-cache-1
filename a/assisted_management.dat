40|$|This study {{critically}} {{examines the}} role of visitor use information in park management planning. Few park planning documents utilise visitor use information. This is thought to result from two problems. Firstly, visitor use studies have been plagued with methodological problems such as unclear objectives, lack of rigour in the survey design and lack of synthesis of information needs. These have resulted in data which are unreliable and at times have no direct implication for management planning. The second problem arises {{from the lack of}} understanding of the role visitor use information may play in the planning process.

40|$|When {{projecting}} livestock environmental {{prospects for}} the 1990 's. {{it is critical to}} recognize the multidimensional nature of managing livestock species under hot environments. This paper identifies potential critical physiological windows during the life cycle of the animal that are sensitive to heat stress and responsive to environmental modification. Ovarian follicular development appears to be sensitive to heat stress leading to reductions in intensity of oestrus and subsequent fertility. Periods of follicular development that are sensitive to heat stress have not been defined. With current improved systems to alter the microenvironment of animals. the period of embryonic sensitivity to heat stress has shifted so that early embryonic losses are less. Potential recombinant proteins that may enhance embryo survival and correct deficiencies in placental function that are induced by heat stress warrant additional investigation. The postpartum period is a critical period in which a multitude of factors interact to influence animal productivity and its sensitivity to heat stress. Nutritional strategies to improve animal performance with the use of fat-supplementation are discussed. Environmental modification and housing systems need to not only maximize the efficiency of animal production but need to consider the potential impact on the environment relative to water use. soil and water pollution. Animal production and management systems need to consider both animal health and well-being issues. To optimize profit under conditions of greater societal constraints and available management alternatives, computer <b>assisted</b> <b>management</b> systems will become a critical tool...|$|E
40|$|Background Pain is {{the most}} common {{presenting}} somatic symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and anxiety are the two most common mental disorders. They frequently co-occur, are under-treated, and result in substantial disability and reduced health-related quality of life. Objectives The Comprehensive vs. <b>Assisted</b> <b>Management</b> of Mood and Pain Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource technology-assisted intervention for the management of patients suffering from pain plus anxiety and/or depression. Methods/design CAMMPS has enrolled 294 primary care patients with chronic pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression and randomized them to either: 1) Assisted Symptom Management (ASM) consisting of automated symptom monitoring by interactive voice recording or Internet and prompted pain and mood self-management; or 2) Comprehensive Symptom Management (CSM) which combines ASM with optimized medication management delivered by a nurse-physician specialist team and facilitated mental health care. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression (PAD) severity score. Secondary outcomes include individual pain, anxiety, and depression scores, health-related quality of life, disability, healthcare utilization, and treatment satisfaction. Discussion CAMMPS provides an integrated approach to PAD symptoms rather than fragmented care of single symptoms; coordinated symptom management in partnership with primary care clinicians and psychologists embedded in primary care; efficient use of health information technology; attention to physical and psychological symptom comorbidity; and the coupling of self-management with optimized medication management and facilitated mental health care...|$|E

40|$|Objective Although the Computer <b>Assisted</b> <b>Management</b> in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial-II (CAMERA-II) showed {{favorable}} clinical {{effects in}} the most intensive methotrexate (MTX) -based strategy with prednisone (MTX ± prednisone) compared to that with placebo (MTX + placebo), this beneficial difference was only seen in 1 of the 3 analyses of remission. Our objective was to investigate whether the Continuity Rewarded (ConRew) score and a simple sum score would better reveal differences regarding remission between the 2 treatment arms of CAMERA-II. Furthermore, we investigated whether the patient vector graph, which plots on patient level, would add visual information on remission compared to a conventional box plot only, which displays data on the group level. Methods The ConRew method, which awards continuous periods of remission with a higher score, was applied, {{in addition to a}} simple sum score of remission periods of 4 weeks. A patient vector graph was compared with box plots. Results Both the mean ± SD simple sum score and the ConRew score of remission were significantly higher (favorable) in the MTX + prednisone strategy group versus the MTX + placebo group, respectively: 9 ± 7 versus 12 ± 8; P = 0. 003, and 23 ± 16 versus 17 ± 14; P = 0. 004. The patient vector graphs show a visual pattern of more and longer periods of remission in the MTX + prednisone strategy and visually add information to the box plots. Conclusion The simple sum of remission periods, the ConRew score, and the patient vector graph add understanding and discrimination to the analysis of the remission outcome in CAMERA-II...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{analyses}} {{using data from the}} Early Utrecht Rheumatoid Arthritis Cohort study group (EURAC; in Dutch called SRU, “Stichting Reumaonderzoek Utrecht”), mainly focusing on the latest study: Computer <b>Assisted</b> <b>Management</b> in early RA trial-II (CAMERA-II). We chose to organize this thesis into two sections: 1. Aiming for Cure: Chapters describing research regarding treatment strategies and analysis of reporting of effects. 2. Commitment to Care: Chapters describing research regarding the more subjective, patient-bound outcomes, such as psychological distress, quality of life and patients' reported disease outcomes. In the first part firstly the literature was extensively explored in two reviews. The first review on tight control strategies showed that although remission rates differed in these studies, in general were not higher in studies applying a biological DMARD from start compared to studies with initial conventional DMARD. The second review, addressing how to best treat established RA based on literature, we concluded that MTX is the anchor DMARD and should be the DMARD of choice to build a combination therapy around and combination therapy should be the treatment of choice. The next two chapters were based on research performed on the CAMERA-II data, showing in one that taking duration of remission periods into account discriminates better between treatment arms and in the other that a multibiomarker disease activity measure correlates with the disease activity score based on 28 joints. Also, in the separate biomarker outcomes, patterns could be seen making it possible to distinguish between the two treatment arms on biomarker level. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, which also contained four chapters, we were able to establish that the improvement of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the past decades has resulted in an improvement of psychological and physical functioning and that the present treatment paradigm of intensive tight-control with treat-to-target (even when it is including prednisone) has no negative effect on the patients quality of life. Furthermore, the weight gain that was more prevalent in the most intensive treatment arm of CAMERA-II (MTX-based strategy with prednisone 10 mg/d vs. MTX-based strategy with placebo) was attributable to the lowering of disease activity and not a side effect of the prednisone use. Finally, we studied our hypothesis that the lack of response to biological DMARDs can be attributable to high scores on the subjective components of the DAS 28. Our hypothesis did not hold: a greater reduction of the combined subjective components was seen in the good responders...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To compare {{as proof}} of concept the {{sensitivity}} to change of automated quantification of radiographic wrist and hand joint space width (JSW) with scoring JSW according to the Sharp/van der Heijde scoring method (SHS) in two strategy groups of a treat-to-target and tight-control early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) study. Methods. Digital radiographs were assessed for JSW changes of 134 patients of the 236 patients participating in the second Computer <b>Assisted</b> <b>Management</b> in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis trial, of whom both baseline and year 2 radiographs were available (year 1 radiographs n = 125). Of those 134 patients, 70 started with methotrexate and prednisone (MTX + Pred) and 64 with MTX and placebo (MTX + Plac). JSW change over 1 and 2 years of the hands and wrists was assessed, applying both the joint space narrowing (JSN) subscore of the SHS by 2 readers and the automated assessment with the JSW quantification software 'JSQ'. For both methods, progression of JSW change of the hand and wrist was analysed using linear mixed modelling (dependent variable 'JSW', factor 'strategy group', covariate 'follow-up time in years', interaction term 'strategy group*follow-up time'; radiographs of baseline, year 1 and year 2 were used). For each method the standardised mean difference (SMD) for the change in JSW from baseline to year 2 between the treatment strategies was obtained using a non-parametric method. Results. Patient characteristics of the current subpopulation {{were similar to those}} of the whole study population. JSN of the hand and wrist according to SHS at 2 years was present in 16 vs. 23 % in the MTX+Pred group vs. the MTX+Plac group. The mean yearly progression rates of JSW change of the hands and wrists using JSQ were - 0. 00 mm (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 01; 0. 01) for MTX + Pred vs. - 0. 02 mm (95 %CI - 0. 03; - 0. 01) for MTX + Plac, p= 0. 045, and using SHS JSN they were 0. 19 units (95 %CI 0. 09; 0. 30) vs. 0. 30 units (95 %CI 0. 14; 0. 45) for MTX + Pred vs. MTX + Plac, p = 0. 271. The SMD for the change from baseline to year 2 between the treatment strategies was 0. 37 for JSQ and 0. 13 for SHS JSN. Conclusion. In this proof of concept study the yearly progression rate of JSW change of hand and wrist joints, according to the automated JSW quantification software package 'JSQ', was higher in the group initiating MTX+Plac than in the group initiating MTX+Pred. A similar trend was seen with the JSN assessment according to the SHS method of the hand and wrist. However, JSN of the hand and wrist according to SHS, the current gold standard to assess radiographic progression, was seen in only about 20 %. Therefore, further studies are needed to conclude firmly that JSQ should be incorporated into quantitative scoring of radiographs in RA...|$|E
