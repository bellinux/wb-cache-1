60|$|I {{was away}} below the ferry now. I rose up, {{and there was}} Jackson's Island, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>mile</b> and a half down stream, heavy timbered and {{standing}} {{up out of the}} middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at the head--it was all under water now.|$|R
5|$|Approximately {{four miles}} (6.4km) east of that junction, M-34 turns north for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> (3.2km) along Benner Highway and {{passes through the}} {{community}} of Cadmus.

McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E

60|$|When we {{got there}} there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and {{perfectly}} dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>mile</b> back in the woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.|$|R

5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov turned around {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> from the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her.

5|$|In Dewey County, SH-34 crosses SH-47, {{two miles}} (3km) south of Leedey, and crosses the Canadian River near the unincorporated {{settlement}} of Trail. The highway then passes through Camargo. Just east of Vici, SH-34 joins US-60 and SH-51 for a one-mile (1.6km) concurrency, then SH-34 heads north again at Vici. The highway passes through Sharon north of Vici, then joins US-183/US-270/SH-3 four miles (6km) southeast of Woodward. At Woodward, SH-34 again sets {{off to the}} north alone, and right after crossing the North Canadian River, SH-34C branches to the east <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> (3km) north of Woodward, connecting to Boiling Springs State Park.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a {{university}} on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus {{is located in}} the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and Collegiate Crescent Campus is <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> away, adjacent to Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. The university is the third largest in the UK, with more than 37,000 students (of whom over 4,000 are international students), 4,170 staff and 747 courses. Sheffield Hallam University's history goes back to 1843 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to {{call off}} the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> away to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched {{west from}} Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> in this {{direction}} (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00a.m., before abruptly turning south toward Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing to a long frost which had hardened the roads and Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed {{for the first time}} in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an effective tool for bombardment.|$|E
60|$|Next day you couldn't {{hear nothing}} around that town but how splendid that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way.

5|$|M-64 {{starts at}} the Wisconsin state line north of Presque Isle, Wisconsin, where it runs north as the {{continuation}} of CTHB into the state of Michigan. The trunkline runs through dense forests along the Presque Isle River {{in a rural area}} of Gogebic County; this region {{is a part of the}} Ottawa National Forest. As the highway enters the community of Marenisco, it follows Pine and Fair avenues through town. On the north side of Marenisco, M-64 turns easterly and runs concurrently with US2 for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> (3km) including a crossing of the Presque Isle River. East of town, M-64 separates from US2 and turns northeasterly toward the southern end of Lake Gogebic. The road turns north along the western shore of the lake and provides access to Lake Gogebic State Park. About halfway along the lakeshore, the highway crosses into Ontonagon County and from the Central to the Eastern time zone.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1985, Disney {{executives}} {{moved the}} animation division from the Disney studio lot in Burbank {{to a variety}} of warehouses, hangars, and trailers located <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> east (3.2 kilometers) in nearby Glendale, California. The animation division's first feature animation at its new location was The Great Mouse Detective (1986), begun by John Musker and Ron Clements as Basil of Baker Street after both left production of The Black Cauldron. The film was enough of a critical and commercial success to instill executive confidence in the animation studio. Later the same year, however, Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment released Don Bluth's An American Tail, which outgrossed The Great Mouse Detective at the box office and became the highest-grossing first-issue animated film to that point.|$|E
5|$|William Thomas Stearn {{was born}} at 37 Springfield Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871/2–1922) and Ellen ("Nellie") Kiddy (1886–1986) of West Suffolk. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the River Cam, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> north of Cambridge's City Centre, where Springfield Road ran {{parallel}} to Milton Road to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (see image). Despite not having any family background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed {{a keen interest in}} natural history and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the wild flowers of the hedgerows and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when William was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties since his widow had no pension.|$|E

5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
