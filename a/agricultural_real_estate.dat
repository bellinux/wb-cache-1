40|$|The article {{investigates the}} concept of <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> {{according}} to Art. 553 of the Civil Code. In particular, the author poses the question to what extent this concept corresponds {{with the requirements of}} modern agriculture. Three issues have been analysed in detail: the legal structure of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> the basis of unity of components arranged into an <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and the legal qualification and functions of particular material components of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> The author concludes that the legislator does not treat an <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> as a unit of ownership only, but approaches this issue from the objective angle. For the time being, such an approach may be considered sufficient. However, in the future there may appear the neeed {{to pay more attention to}} functional aspects of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> and thus the reference to the economic category of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> may prove necessary. At present, {{the concept of}} an agricultural productive unit assumes the presence of agricultural land. This is why the Civil Code provisions on agricultural real estates are not applicable to agricultural productive units that do not have such land. The author postulates to amend the Code provisions adequately. Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> has {{historically}} been what observers call a “thin market,” in that very little is marketed and changes ownership at any given point in time. In fact, even when there is spirited buying interest and willingness to bid aggressively, the supply side {{of the market for}} agricultural land tends to be inelastic - in that the percentage change in quantity put on the market is much less that the percentage increase in bid prices. Of course, this partially explains upward value trends to <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> over time. If potential buyers realize there is only a limited offering on the market at any given point in time, or that a particular land tract of interest may not be for sale for decades, then they will tend to bid more aggressively when the opportunity arises. Even when the income-earnings potential of <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> may be less than desirable at the time, buyers may still be willing to compete hard for an agricultural property, knowing that the window-of-opportunity to buy it is limited...|$|E

40|$|Since {{independence}} {{the great}} land reform {{had been held}} that brought private property in land relations in Ukraine. But {{at the same time}} the agricultural land market through the introduction of a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land had stopped functioning. The lack of a common classification of property for agricultural purposes, a number of legal and legislative aspects are currently the main obstacles to the creation of a transparent market for <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> which includes not only the land but also buildings and structures that are directly or not used in agriculture. The main aim of the article is to highlight the constructive action to improve the functioning of the market for <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> namely the possibility of creating an integrated classifier to <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and amend the information files of the State Land Cadastre and State Register of rights to real estate. The successful operation of agricultural property market in Ukraine would be ruling out in the absence of a common classification of real estate for agricultural purposes, so this classification should be offered. At this stage, the existing categories of land use purpose designed classifier property for agricultural purposes is integrated with links to existing Classification and aims to unify all objects of agricultural purpose in a single classification. Creation classification of objects of agricultural purpose, of course, accelerate the successful start functioning agricultural estate market, but it in no time, not provide it completely. And one of the main obstacles to implementing it is valid to do at this time in Ukraine a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land. According to the authors, the lack of legitimate opportunities to operate in the market for <b>agricultural</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> leads to illegal activities to the ground and holding back the development of the State Land Cadastre and slows conduct any research and development in the field of land evaluation.
