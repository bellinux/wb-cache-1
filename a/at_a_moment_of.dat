Unusual for the time, La dame blanche was based on episodes from two novels by Walter Scott. The libretto by Eugène Scribe is built around {{the theme of the}} long lost child fortunately recognized <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> peril. The style of the opera influenced Lucia di Lammermoor, I puritani and La jolie fille de Perth. La dame blanche {{was one of the first}} attempts to introduce the fantastic into opera.|$|E

500|$|The Mortara case was, in {{the view}} of Timothy Verhoeven, the {{greatest}} controversy to surround the Catholic Church in the mid-19th century, as it [...] "more than any other single issue... exposed the divide between supporters and opponents of the Vatican". Abigail Green writes that [...] "this clash between liberal and Catholic worldviews <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> critical international tension... gave the Mortara affair global significance—and rendered it a transformative episode in the Jewish world as well". Mortara himself suggested in 1893 that his abduction had been, for a time, [...] "more famous than that of the Sabine Women".|$|E

The Democratic [...] "Solid South" [...] had long {{been a source of}} frustration to Republican ambitions. Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners. Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy. Through his first term, he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans {{in the aftermath of the}} Civil Rights Movement. He nominated two Southern conservatives, Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
2500|$|Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss was {{commissioned}} in 1787 by Colonel John Campbell. It {{is regarded as}} a masterpiece of Neoclassical sculpture, but shows the mythological lovers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> great emotion, characteristic of the emerging movement of Romanticism.

2500|$|Vergara {{has been}} {{compared}} to Jacob Riis [...] for his photographic documentation of American slums and decaying urban environments. [...] Beginning in the 1980s, Vergara applied the technique of rephotography to a series of American cities, photographing the same buildings and neighborhoods from the exact vantage point at regular intervals over many years to capture changes over time. [...] Trained as a sociologist with a specialty in urbanism, Vergara turned to his systematic documentation <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> urban decay, and he chose locales where that stress seemed highest: [...] the housing projects of Chicago; the South Bronx of New York City; Camden, New Jersey; and Detroit, Michigan, among others.|$|E

2500|$|Almost every {{episode title}} for the first eight seasons begins with the word [...] "My".

A few episodes are told from another character's perspective and have episode titles such as [...] "His Story" [...] or [...] "Her Story". Apart from {{a brief period of}} narration from J.D. at the beginning and the end, these episodes primarily contain internal narration from other characters besides J.D. The transfer of the narration duties usually occurs <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> physical contact between two characters.

2500|$|Some land {{reinforcements}} {{were sent}} in May and June. However when Palmerston, {{alarmed by the}} blockade and the Trent affair, pressed for {{increasing the number of}} regular troops in Canada to 10,000, he met resistance. Sir George Cornwall Lewis, head of the War Office, questioned whether there was any real threat to Great Britain. He judged it [...] "incredible that any Government of ordinary prudence should <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> civil war gratuitously increase the number of its enemies, and, moreover, incur the hostility of so formidable a power as England." [...] In the debate in Parliament on June 21 there was general opposition to reinforcements, based on political, military, and economic arguments. [...] A long standing issue was the attempt by Parliament to shift more of the burden of Canadian defense to the local government. Colonial secretary Newcastle, felt that the requests by Williams were part of a pattern of the [...] "last few years" [...] in which he had [...] "been very fertile of demands and suggestions." [...] Newcastle was also concerned that there were no winter quarters available for additional troops and he feared desertions would be a serious problem.|$|E
