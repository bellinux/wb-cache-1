This classical two dimensional optimization problem can be extended by a third dimension, namely tactile cueing. With increasing level of control augmentation for helicopters, driven by fly-by-wire technology, also their handling qualities (flying qualities) are tailored by using advanced control modes like attitude command or translational rate command. To get fully access to the overall active rotorcraft, also the pilot inceptors are considered to exhibit active features, which are the dynamic force-displacement characteristics. This allows the adaptation of these characteristics to the control law and control modes, and in addition tactile cueing or feedback in an integrated approach.

By determining the pixel coordinates on the video frame and by using a range finder the target’s geo-location is determined in the North-East-Down (NED) frame. The contribution of this method is that the target can be localized to within 9 m when view from an altitude of 2500 m and down to 1 m from an altitude of 100 m. This method offers a highly versatile tracking and geo-localisation technique that has very good number of advantages over the previously suggested methods.

40|$|In ALLFlight (Assisted Low Level Flight and Landing on Unprepared Landing Sites) a pilot {{assistance}} {{system is}} developed {{which allows the}} intuitive operation of a manned helicopter from start to landing on unprepared landing sites and an intermediate low level flight {{in the presence of}} obstacles in a degraded visual environment. The objective of ALLFlight is the achievement of a safe and effective 24 h <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> <b>operation</b> under above conditions by providing the pilot an optimal combination of assistance, consisting of advanced visual and tactile cueing and intelligent control augmentation, reducing his workload and increasing his situational and mission awareness. An extremum of this development is the fully automatic flight and landing of manned helicopter in a confined area. ALLFlight will provide curved and unsteady trajectories (in space and time) for all phases of operational helicopter flight (take-off, low level flight, landing) under all conditions (day, night, degraded vision). The trajectory generation incorporates the cognitive pilot's decision processes for trajectory planning in the described scenarios and bases on a highly accurate digital reproduction of the present helicopter surrounding world, including terrain and obstacle data. For this a pre-processed terrain data base is updated by actual sensors, making use of data fusion techniques (laser, radar, infrared). The latest handling qualities cognitions will drive the development and maturing of the relevant assistance systems (automation, visual and haptic support) and their coalescence to allow the pilot an intuitive following of the generated trajectories or surfaces in dependence of the present flight phase and environment condition. The integration of all systems and all relevant flight tests will be performed on the FHS research helicopter. Finally, the possible integration of the developed procedures into the regulations of air traffic management in controlled and uncontrolled areas of the European airspace will be investigated. ...|$|E

The main objective is to achieve a safe and effective 24 h <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> <b>operation</b> capability of DLR’s research helicopter EC- 135 under difficult visual conditions, e. g. in brown-out or white-out situations. This will be realized by providing the pilot assistance with the help of advanced visual and tactile cueing and intelligent control augmentation. Reducing pilot’s workload and increasing his situational and mission awareness are some more objectives within this project. ALLFlight deals with the integration of a full scale enhanced vision sensor suite onto DLR’s research helicopter. This sensor suite consists of a wide set of imaging sensors, such as a colour TV camera, an un-cooled thermal infrared camera, an optical radar scanner and a mmW radar system. A compact high performance so-called sensor co-computer system (SCC) has been designed and realized to be able to process and display the huge incoming flood of data from these sensors. This computer system can easily be installed into the helicopter’s experimental electronic cargo bay. A sophisticated, high performance, distributed data acquisition, recording, processing, and fusion software architecture has been developed and implemented during the first project year. This paper explains the architectural software concept and the implementation of the SCC. Some first data replays of gathered sensor data and some concepts of data fusion and display formats will be discussed. During the forthcoming years until 2012 the output will result into a broader mission potential of the helicopter compared to the present situation whenever a mission cannot be performed or has to be cancelled due to a degraded visual environment...|$|E

30|$|However, these {{requirements}} have mainly been proposed to support aeronautical operations (ranging from en-route phase to approach operation with vertical guidance, called APV II). In fact, continuity requirements were introduced {{for the first}} time in aviation in the late 1960 s to define precise approach requirements for a radio navigation system, called the Instrument Landing System (ILS). The purpose was to describe the quality of service during a most critical phase of operation (e.g. 15  s for the precise approach phase of an aeroplane before landing, duration in which service interruption is dangerous). Continuity requirement was derived by means of a risk allocation from the Target Level of Safety (TLS), whereas TLS results from statistical analysis of historical accident data of aeroplanes for a given period. In 1993, the ICAO’s Air Navigation Commission requested <b>All</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Operations</b> Panel (AWOP) to examine the possibility of extending the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concept, which was originally intended for en-route operations, to include approach, landing and departure operations.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the activities completed under {{a grant from}} the NASA Langley Research Center to develop a plan for the assessment, improvement, and deployment of a Radar Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) for the detection of wake vortices. A brief review is provided of existing alternative instruments for wake vortex detection. This is followed by a review of previous implementations and assessment of a RASS. As a result of this review, it is concluded that the basic features of a RASS have several advantages over other commonly used wake vortex detection and measurement systems. Most important of these features are the good fidelity of the measurements and the potential for <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> <b>operation.</b> To realize the full potential of this remote sensing instrument, a plan {{for the development of a}} RASS designed specifically for wake vortex detection and measurement has been prepared. To keep costs to a minimum, this program would start with the development an inexpensive laboratory-scale version of a RASS system. The new instrument would be developed in several stages, each allowing for a critical assessment of the instrument s potential and limitations. The instrument, in its initial stages of development, would be tested in a controlled laboratory environment. A jet vortex simulator, a prototype version of which has already been fabricated, would be interrogated by the RASS system. The details of the laboratory vortex would be measured using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. In the early development stages, the scattered radar signal would be digitized and the signal post-processed to determine how extensively and accurately the RASS could measure properties of the wake vortex. If the initial tests prove to be successful, a real-time, digital signal processing system would be developed as a component of the RASS system. At each stage of the instrument development and testing, the implications of the scaling required for a full-scale instrument would be considered. It is concluded that a RASS system, developed for the specific application of wake vortex detection, could become part of a robust Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS). This system, in turn, could contribute to Reduced Spacing Operations (RSO) in US airports and improvements in Terminal Area productivity (TAP) ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{currently}} existing {{rules for the}} use of EVS in combination with operational benefits (FAA rule on Enhanced Flight Visibility or the respective JAA approach published in the NPA OPS 41 Subpart E <b>All</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Operations)</b> do not allow an EVS head-down display. The rule requires that EFVS include a head-up display rather than the alternative of a head-down display because the pilot is conducting an instrument approach procedure in lower visibility conditions, but with no change in the prescribed instrument approach minima and must accomplish several visually-related judgments and control tasks in quick succession. While the regulatory requirements {{for the use of}} EFVS are analogous to the conventional requirements for descent and operation below DH or MDA, the pilot needs to use the imagery, the flight reference information, and eventually the outside view, at the same time. The pilot must be able to look for the outside visual references in the same location as they appear in the EFVS image and readily see them as soon as visibility conditions permit, without any delays or distraction due to multiple head-up/ head-down transitions. When scanning between the head-up and head-down views, it takes additional time for the pilot to reacquire the information in each view and for the pilot’s eyes to readjust for differences in light level and changes in focus between optical infinity and the distance to the instrument panel. Repeated scanning between the head-up and head-down views would be distracting, increase pilot workload and potentially degrade path performance during a critical phase of flight. However, our proposal for the use of EVS does allow for a head-down display to continue the descent below DH/MDA. The above mentioned concerns against head-down display can be overcome by an introduction of an adequate crew procedure and display design The task sharing between Pilot-Flying and Pilot-Not-Flying has to be arranged such that multiple head-up/head-down transitions can be avoided. The Pilot-Flying is using the head-down display for acquisition of the necessary visual cues in the EVS image. The pilot flying is monitoring the instruments and looking for the outside visual cues. The use of reduced RVR (as described in the JAA NPA OPS 41) will help the crew to define the point when one can expect the runway to become visible. Thus, this aspect is included in the approach briefing. In addition, the approach briefing covers the aspect of who will conduct the visual landing once visual contact to the runway is established and how - in case there will be no hand-over of the controls – the pilot-not-flying can support the pilot-flying in immediately detection the runway after his transition from head-down to head-up. This contribution focuses on the results of simulation trials with pilots using DLR’s cockpit simulator GECO. The simulation trials compares {{the currently}} used head-up display design with the new head-down display in combination with the defined crew procedure. Results are given in terms of performance and workload assessments. ...|$|R
