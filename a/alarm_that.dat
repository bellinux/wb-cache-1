5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E
25|$|To allow {{protection}} from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a full face mask and is worn to protect against smoke inhalation, toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A special device called a Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) is commonly worn independently or {{as a part of}} the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> can assist another firefighter (firefighter assist and search team (FAST), or rapid intervention team (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.|$|E

It was <b>alarming</b> <b>that</b> a socialist-mixed-economy state could do in a few short months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly <b>alarming</b> <b>that</b> the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's political and moral legitimacy.|$|R

25|$|A bank {{might be}} {{interested}} in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E
25|$|After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marcel Janco's {{buildings}} {{were subject to}} legal battles, as the original owners and their descendants were allowed to contest the nationalization. These landmarks, like other modernist assets, became treasured real estate: in 1996, a Janco house was valued at 500,000 United States dollars. The sale of such property happened at a fast pace, reportedly surpassing the standardized conservation effort, and experts noted with <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> Janco villas were being defaced with anachronistic additions, such as insulated glazing and structural interventions, or eclipsed by the newer highrise. In 2008, despite calls from within the academic community, only three of his buildings had been inscribed in the National Register of Historic Monuments.|$|E
25|$|A manual {{shutdown}} {{was initiated}} {{during the middle}} of a start-up operation. The cause was a high pressure <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual reactor shutdown. An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The textile {{question}} {{played a}} role in West's election, as thousands of mill workers who had strayed from the Democratic Party to support George C. Wallace's independent candidacy returned to their ancestral political home. Each party blamed the other for the failure to obtain import restrictions. Democrats expressed <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> textile workers were losing jobs as plants were unable to compete on the world market. Democrats urged President Nixon through executive orders to curtail clothing imports from the Far East; Republicans insisted that only Congress had the legal authority to limit the importation of man-made fabrics. Presidential counselor Harry S. Dent, Sr., of South Carolina, another former aide to Strom Thurmond and the liaison official between the White House and the state GOP organizations, said that the administration was meeting with foreign competitors to devise voluntary restraints. Dent said that Nixon was pledged to veto bills with quotas on any item except textiles.|$|E
25|$|He was {{concerned}} too {{about the potential}} spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's Catholic Action movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway. The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with excommunication anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal La Civilta Cattolica, active in Vatican circles, further spread <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> fifth columns of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas.|$|E
25|$|Lovat held {{a council}} amongst his {{men with the}} Whig lairds preferring a siege to starve out the Jacobites, but he {{resolved}} to attack the town instead. However, before {{he could make a}} move Aurthur Rose, younger son of Rose of Kilravrock, along with his brother Robert and a handful of men had drifted towards Inverness in a boat. Rose of Kilravrock and Forbes of Culloden had already blockaded the town from the south east. Sir John Mackenzie, on learning of the imminent attack took up position in the Tolbooth, which was a strong building in the centre of the town, and served as the guard house. Arthur Rose had taken a sentry guard by surprise with his pistol in the dark and used him to get the door of the guard house open. Rose tried to storm in but the guard raised the <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> he was an enemy and Rose ended up being crushed in the door and was shot dead in that position by the Mackenzies. He was the only fatality of the siege.|$|E

25|$|In , D'murr is {{piloting}} {{one of two}} heighliners which Hasimir Fenring uses to secretly {{test the}} synthetic melange created by the Tleilaxu in their Project Amal. The flawed spice disrupts and confuses D'murr's thoughts, feelings and prescience. He is compelled to send a telepathic message to his twin C'tair (who is hiding on Tleilaxu-conquered Ix) that his own heighliner carries rightful Ixian ruler Rhombur Vernius, {{on his way to}} free the planet. Disastrously, the first heighliner emerges from foldspace at the wrong point, striking the defensive shields of Wallach IX and plummeting into the atmosphere to its destruction. Affected by the tainted melange, D'murr misguides his ship out of the known universe and collapses. As his spice supply is replaced with real melange, D'murr senses with <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> 'the enemy has seen us' (this is presumably the first reference to the Unknown Enemy that, millennia later, chases the Honored Matres back to the Old Empire in Heretics of Dune and threatens to destroy humanity). D'murr uses the last of his strength to return the ship safely to Junction, home of the Guild Headquarters, and dies.|$|E
25|$|From around 1967 onwards, the Anglican-Methodist unity scheme {{began to}} run into problems. There was strong {{opposition}} from Anglo-Catholics, and the Voice of Methodism campaigned against it. Following initial <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> the Scheme would begin in 1965, voting was delayed until 1969. There were many arguments over the ‘Service of Reconciliation’. It was argue that by asserting the historic episcopate {{the doctrine of the}} priesthood of all believers, stated in the 1932 Methodist Deed of Union, was being denied. The debate became acrimonious, reaching a low point with the publication of the book 'Anglican-Methodist Unity: Some Considerations Historical and Liturgical' by Margaret Deanesly and Geoffrey G. Willis. The Voice of Methodism brought a Chancery Court case against the Methodist Connexion. It was claimed that the degree of opposition expressed in the Methodist District Synods and Circuit Meetings did not represent the true depth of feeling against the Scheme in the pews. Around a tenth of the Church left. At the votes taken in July 1969, the Methodist Conference accepted the Scheme, but insufficient support was given in the Anglican Convocations and, despite several attempts to revive it, the proposals lapsed.|$|E

500|$|The oil spill, located {{immediately}} {{north of}} Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County, California, originated in a [...] diameter underground pipeline named Line 901 owned by Plains All American Pipeline. Crude oil produced by offshore platforms was transported from onshore receiving plants to another pipeline that transported the oil inland for processing. The oil pipeline operators in Midland, Texas had turned off an <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> would have notified {{them of the}} leak as {{they were dealing with}} a separate problem with a pump. The 28 year old pipeline was not equipped with an automatic shut-off valve and was eventually shut down by control operators when they were notified of the leak from parties who visually located the spill.|$|E
500|$|The player must {{navigate}} the protagonist, Solid Snake, through the game's areas without being detected by enemies.

500|$|World War I was {{a turning}} point in Filitti's {{diplomatic}} career. Like many of his fellow Conservatives, and against the lobby which dominated the PNL, he believed in tying Romania to the Central Powers, especially to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. The Entente Powers alternative, he argued, was bankrupt, because Romania would find herself manipulated by a hostile Russian Empire. His core idea, paraphrased by Georgeta Filitti, was that: [...] "Any entente, any attempt to collaborate, any concession made to [...] would sooner or later turn against us." [...] The diplomat witnessed with <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> public opinion was against him, either because of seductive Francophilia, or because a war on Austria-Hungary could bring Romania Transylvania region and other irredenta: [...] "The Russian gold has bought off the press and many private persons. Others are guided by sentimentality". In restaurants such as Casa Capșa, [...] "Franco-hysteria and Russo-Frenchitude [...] a peak", and [...] "people of no significance" [...] were even proposing to assassinate the Germanophile King Carol. In this context, he believed, Transylvania could only stand to lose its character if ever governed from Bucharest.|$|E
500|$|By 3:11p.m., a DeKalb Fire Department {{ambulance}} was {{the first}} to arrive on the scene and was staged in a nearby parking lot. The parking lots near the Field House were used as a staging area for ambulances and fire trucks that arrived from throughout the region. At 3:13p.m., Sergeant Ellington advised that there were at least two deaths. Officers encountered several problems, including a piercing fire <b>alarm</b> <b>that</b> had been pulled, as well as very high radio traffic and static that made it hard to hear radio calls come in.

[...] He then joined the Continental Army in May 1775 as a major in Bridge's Regiment, and was among the troops sent to fortify Breed's Hill on the night of June 16–17. [...] He missed the next day's Battle of Bunker Hill, because he was sent by Colonel William Prescott to request reinforcements. [...] He continued to serve in the Siege of Boston, transferring to the 19th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776. [...] One of Brooks' subordinates in this unit was William Hull, with whom he formed a fast friendship. [...] After the British withdrawal from Boston, Brooks' regiment next saw action in the October 1776 Battle of White Plains, and was in General George Washington's retreat across New Jersey afterward.
