500|$|The book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2007 {{prompted}} a reevaluation {{of the book}} from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in Carousel magazine, wondered if {{the popularity of the}} Cat and his [...] "delicious naughty behavior" [...] will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, [...] "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{underwent}} further tightening, namely {{with improved}} sewer lighting and {{the incorporation of}} the Javert suicide scene effect. Boublil explained: [...] "The transfer from London to the United States has prompted further modifications. 'We are taking this opportunity to rethink and perfect, to rewrite some details which probably {{no one else will}} see, but which for us are still long nights of work,' Mr. Boublil says. 'There are things that nobody had time to do in London, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a wonderful opportunity to fix a few things. No one will notice, perhaps, but for us, it will make us so happy if we can better this show. We would like this to be the final version.'" [...] Two songs were deleted—the complete version of Gavroche's song [...] "Little People" [...] and the adult Cosette's [...] "I Saw Him Once". A short section at the beginning of [...] "In My Life" [...] replaced [...] "I Saw Him Once". The lyrics in Javert's [...] "Stars" [...] were changed. It now ended with the line, [...] "This I swear by the stars!", while the London production and cast recording ended with the repeated line, [...] "Keeping watch in the night".|$|E

5000|$|Following World War I, the Polish-Ukrainian War {{broke out}} in eastern Galicia. Oil wells of the region were of {{particular}} importance, and on Sunday, May 17, 1919, the suburbs of Drohobycz were captured by a mounted company of 180 men, led by Colonel Stanisław Maczek. After a battle with the Ukrainians, the cities of Drohobycz and nearby Borysław were seized by the Poles on the next day: [...] "Polish lands were destroyed, powerless <b>and</b> fallow. <b>And</b> <b>here,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gold in our hands. In those years, we bought everything for that oil, even beans from Yugoslavia" [...] (page 192).|$|R

One day is surprisingly like another about these times, for us mariners in particular." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{script was}} brilliant. We even hired Christopher Guest to direct it. I've thought {{so many times}} about what went wrong. I always like to say I have the {{distinction}} of making the only unsuccessful Christopher Guest movie.You never know with movies. It's kind of like alchemy; the chemistry just didn't work. It had all the right actors. It had a great director, a great script. But I think {{the tone of the}} comedy was very odd. It almost read better than it played. It wanted to be a quirky, British, Black Adder type of comedy, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> Chris Farley <b>and</b> Matthew Perry. It was just a weird combination.

60|$|Then {{came the}} chase. It seemed it never would end. They raced {{us through the}} trees, the whole tribe of them, and nearly caught us. We were forced {{to take to the}} ground, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the advantage, for they were truly the Tree People, and while they out-climbed us we out-footed them on the ground. We broke away toward the north, the tribe howling on our track. Across the open spaces we gained, and in the brush they caught up with us, and more than once it was nip and tuck. And as the chase continued, we {{realized}} that we were not their kind, either, and that the bonds between us were anything but sympathetic.|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, I {{shall make}} some {{inquiry into the}} nature and grounds of FAITH or OPINION: whereby I mean that assent which we give to any {{proposition}} as true, of whose truth yet <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no certain knowledge. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> occasion to examine the reasons and degrees of ASSENT.|$|R

60|$|When a species, {{owing to}} highly {{favourable}} circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers {{in a small}} tract, epidemics--at least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue: <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even some of these so-called epidemics appear {{to be due to}} parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.|$|E

Because of your rattle, your hollow rattle--a sound, as I have been told, like the shaking {{together}} of small, dry skulls in a tune of the Waltz of Death. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> another beautiful truth. When any creature is by its make inimical to other creatures, nature in effect labels that creature, much as an apothecary does a poison. So that whoever is destroyed by a rattle-snake, or other harmful agent, it is his own fault. He should have respected the label. Hence that significant passage in Scripture, 'Who will pity the charmer that is bitten with a serpent?'" ...|$|E

60|$|I leave entirely {{upon one}} side all {{questions}} of morality; {{but there is}} still one point of expediency on which I must touch. The old native Government (which was at least cheap) failed to enforce the law, and fell, in consequence, into the manifold troubles which have made the name of Samoa famous. The enforcement of the law--that was what was required, that was the salvation looked for. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a Government at a high figure, and it cannot defend its own gaol, and can find no better remedy than to assassinate its prisoners. What we have bought at this enormous increase of expenditure is the change from King Log to King Stork--from the man who failed to punish petty theft to the man who plots the destruction of his own gaol and the death of his own prisoners.|$|E
60|$|Ballantyne's style often {{gives rise}} to two or even three stories {{continuing}} simultaneously, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the adventures of one Rooney Machowl, an Irishman who decides to move from his ship's carpenter trade to that of diving. In fact divers should always have another trade, or they wouldn't be much use under the water. In addition there is the aspiration of Edgar Berrington to win {{the hand of a}} fair young lady, there are the events happening to the young lady's father, and then again the events happening to the young lady's companion. So it is all fairly convoluted. But you'll certainly learn a lot about diving, as the art stood in 1876. It is rather strange that Ballantyne, having written this book, which ran to several printings, did not much mention diving in any other of his books.|$|E
