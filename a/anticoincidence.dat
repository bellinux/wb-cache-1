The goal of the thesis is to study the spatial structure of MgII systems. The quasars were observed at resolutions R∼ 4 500 and R∼ 40 000. The search yielded a sample of 31 MgII absorption systems at 0. 4 <z< 1. 6 and probing transverse separations between lines of sight (LOS) in the range 0. 29 - 23 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc. Adding systems from the literature {{increased the number of}} systems to 95. The range of transverse separation of the full sample is 0. 3 - 100 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc. In this sample, the dispersion in the fractional equivalent width differences, Δ W_r, decreases with equivalent width for strong systems while no high Δ W_r values are found for transverse distances d< 9 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc. This is in agreement with a smooth distribution of gas at these scales. In addition, these systems show a trend of increasing Δ W_r with transverse separation. For weak systems, the dispersion in Δ W_r with respect to W_r is greater than for strong systems. In this case <b>anticoincidences</b> (i. e., absorption in just one LOS) are found homogeneously in the range 0. 2 - 30 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc. For coincidences, Δ W_r increases with transverse separation but after 3 - 4 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc the trend reverses. These results indicate that weak systems are more patchy or smaller than strong ones. To estimate transverse sizes, I have used two likelihood methods. The first one considers the absorption systems as spheres or disks with a uniform distribution of gas. This method yields R∼ 10 and 14 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc for weak and strong systems, respectively. The second likelihood method uses the individual equivalent widths and assumes the equivalent width varies with impact parameter, i. e. W_r=W_r(r). For W_r(r), I tested a power law and a logarithmic function. The logarithmic function seems to be in better agreement with the data for both strong and weak systems. The second method yields R∼ 20 and 40 h^- 1 _ 70 kpc for weak and strong systems, respectively. Thus, both methods yield smaller sizes for weak population. These sizes are much smaller than estimates using just the frequency of systems, dN/dz. Combining the results of models and observations suggests that size estimation of strong MgII systems is consistent with the assumed distribution of gas, while for weak systems the resulted sizes from the likelihood analysis seem to be overestimated.

A plastic scintillator may be used across the front which is reasonably transparent to gamma rays, but efficiently rejects the high fluxes of cosmic-ray protons present in space.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{experiments}} in nuclear and high-energy particle physics almost invariably use fast <b>anticoincidence</b> circuits to veto unwanted events. [...] The desired events are typically accompanied by unwanted background processes {{that must be}} suppressed by enormous factors, ranging from thousands to many billions, to permit the desired signals to be detected and studied. Extreme examples {{of these kinds of}} experiments may be found at the Large Hadron Collider, where the enormous Atlas and CMS detectors must reject huge numbers of background events at very high rates, to isolate the very rare events being sought.|$|E
50|$|When {{the first}} {{attempts}} to detect X-rays and gamma-rays from the Sun, {{it was found}} that the background flux in space was of the same order of magnitude as the maximum theoretical estimates for the primary flux. Thus, any detector had to be capable of suppressing this background. Lead shielding to reject this background and provide angular collimation had proved unsuccessful since it generated its own background through interactions with cosmic rays. Frost was the first to suggest the use of an active scintillation shield around the X-ray/gamma-ray detector with the two connected in electronic <b>anticoincidence</b> to reject unwanted charged particle events and to provide the required angular collimation.|$|E
50|$|Early experimenters in X-ray and gamma-ray {{astronomy}} {{found that}} their detectors, flown on balloons or sounding rockets, were corrupted by the large fluxes of high-energy photon and cosmic-ray charged-particle events. Gamma-rays, in particular, could be collimated by surrounding the detectors with heavy shielding materials made of lead or other such elements, but it was quickly discovered that the high fluxes of very penetrating high-energy radiation present in the near-space environment created showers of secondary particles {{that could not be}} stopped by reasonable shielding masses. To solve this problem, detectors operating above 10 or 100 keV were often surrounded by an active <b>anticoincidence</b> shield made of some other detector, which could be used to reject the unwanted background events.|$|E

Each detector was 6.5 cm in diameter by 6.5 cm deep (among the largest in the world at the time), for a total detector area of 242 cm2 and a total detector volume of [...] The liquid nitrogen-cooled detectors were shielded on all sides by 15 cm of NaI active <b>anticoincidence</b> shielding for rejection of background events. The instrument had a three-sigma narrow line sensitivity of 1.7 x 10−4 picohenries per square centimeter per second at 500 keV over 12 hours, and a field of view (FWHM) of 17 degrees at 500 keV.|$|E
5000|$|The Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment, (OSSE), by the Naval Research Laboratory {{detected}} {{gamma rays}} entering {{the field of}} view of any of four detector modules, which could be pointed individually, and were effective in the 0.05 to 10 MeV range. Each detector had a central scintillation spectrometer crystal of NaI(Tl) 12 in (303 mm) in diameter, by 4 in (102 mm) thick, optically coupled at the rear to a 3 in (76.2 mm) thick CsI(Na) crystal of similar diameter, viewed by seven photomultiplier tubes, operated as a phoswich: i.e., particle and gamma-ray events from the rear produced slow-rise time (~1 μs) pulses, which could be electronically distinguished from pure NaI events from the front, which produced faster (~0.25 μs) pulses. Thus the CsI backing crystal acted as an active <b>anticoincidence</b> shield, vetoing events from the rear. A further barrel-shaped CsI shield, also in electronic <b>anticoincidence,</b> surrounded the central detector on the sides and provided coarse collimation, rejecting gamma rays and charged particles from the sides or most of the forward field-of-view (FOV). A finder level of angular collimation was provided by a tungsten slat collimator grid within the outer CsI barrel, which collimated the response to a 3.8° x 11.4° FWHM rectangular FOV. A plastic scintillator across the front of each module vetoed charged particles entering from the front. The four detectors were typically operated in pairs of two. During a gamma-ray source observation, one detector would take observations of the source, while the other would slew slightly off source to measure the background levels. The two detectors would routinely switch roles, allowing for more accurate measurements of both the source and background. The instruments could slew with a speed of approximately 2 degrees per second.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic <b>anticoincidence</b> is {{a method}} (and its {{associated}} hardware) widely used to suppress unwanted, [...] "background" [...] events in high energy physics, experimental particle physics, gamma-ray spectroscopy, gamma-ray astronomy, experimental nuclear physics, and related fields.

But the desired events are mixed up with {{a significant number of}} other events, produced by other particles or other processes, which create indistinguishable events in the detector. Very often it is possible to arrange other physical photon or particle detectors to intercept the unwanted background events, producing essentially simultaneous pulses that can be used with fast electronics to reject, or veto, the unwanted background.|$|E
50|$|The payload {{consisted}} of two sets of proportional counters, each with ~0.084 m2 effective area. The counters were sensitive with more than 10% efficiency to X-ray photons in the ~2-20 keV range. The lower energy limit {{was determined by the}} attenuation of the beryllium windows of the counter plus a thin thermal shroud that was needed to maintain temperature stability of the spacecraft.The upper energy limit was determined by the transmission properties of the counter filling gas. Pulse-shape discrimination and <b>anticoincidence</b> techniques were used to filter out emissions of particles and undesirable high-energy photons in the background. Pulse-height analysis in eight energy channels was used to obtain information on the energy spectrum of the incident photons. The two sets of counters were placed back to back and were collimated to 0.52° × 0.52° and 5.2° × 5.2° (full width at half maximum) respectively. While the 0.52° detector gave finer angular resolution, the 5.2° detector had higher sensitivity for isolated sources.|$|E
50|$|Since NASA {{scientists}} {{wanted only}} {{certain types of}} gamma rays to be processed and recorded, they set up EGRET with many systems of checks to filter out any unwanted information. The most basic type of filter EGRET had was only allowing gamma rays entering the telescope from certain angles to be let into the spark chamber. As the gamma ray travelled through the spark chamber, it struck one of the metal plates within the spark chamber. Once the gamma ray {{came in contact with}} a plate of metal, it initiated the process of electron-positron pair production and created an electron and positron. Once both the electron and positron were created, if one of these particles was still moving down throughout the telescope and a signal from the <b>anticoincidence</b> scintillator wasn’t fired, the particle was imaged and its energy level recorded. With each gamma ray having to pass all of these systems of checks, the results of EGRET were supported to be the most valuable out of the other CGRO instruments.|$|E
