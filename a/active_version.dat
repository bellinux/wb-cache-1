25|$|The {{voltage drop}} VF across the forward biased diode {{in the circuit}} of a passive {{rectifier}} is undesired. In this <b>active</b> <b>version,</b> the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of VF. As a result, the voltage drop VF is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (super) diode with VF = 0 V.|$|E

40|$|The {{causes of}} {{antibiotic}} resistance are often complex {{and it is}} difficult to identify strategies to prevent or delay its emergence. One strategy has been to use less active members of a drug class, so that when resistance develops the more active members will still prevail.

Often, less active drugs are the first to be discovered and more <b>active</b> <b>versions</b> follow, so we have had no choice; however, increasingly less active drugs are available to deal with specific infections and this may have a detri-mental effect on the class as a whole...|$|R

Recruiting and training military units allows players to attack other Provinces to plunder their resources, and defend from enemy attacks. Players may trade their resources with other players after they've built a marketplace on their own territory. The Province grows into an empire through territory annexing and colonizing. Players can communicate with each other using in-game messages, and may join alliances for military and economic co-operation with other players.|$|E

40|$|Basic {{studies of}} factors that limit RF fields in warm {{accelerator}} structures require experiments at RF powers that can be produced using pulse compression. This approach is being implemented to compress output pulses from the Yale/Omega-P 34 -GHz magnicon to produce ~ 100 - 200 MW, 100 ns pulses. A new approach for passive pulse compression is a SLED-II type circuit operating with axisymmetrical modes of the TE 0 n type that requires only a single channel {{instead of the usual}} double channel scheme. This allows one to avoid a 3 -dB coupler and need for simultaneous fine tuning of two channels. A 30 GHz passive prototype was tested at low power level in order to demonstrate key principles. The prototype showed a power gain 4. 5 at a compression ratio 6 : 1 for an efficiency 63 %. An <b>active</b> <b>version</b> of the one-channel pulse compressor is also suggested. It is attractive due to the possibility to achieve higher power gain. The <b>active</b> <b>version</b> naturally requires an electrically controlled coupler. In particular, as active elements of the coupler we suggest to use either gas filled discharge tubes or ferroelectrics...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNF-ATc, an inducibly {{expressed}} transcription factor, controls {{gene expression}} in T lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes. We show {{here that the}} transcriptional coactivators CBP/p 300 bind to and control {{the activity of the}} inducible N-terminal transactivation domain of NF-ATc, TAD-A. Similar to the N terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun, TAD-A is inducibly phosphorylated, but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with CBP/p 300. Constitutive <b>active</b> <b>versions</b> of c-Raf and Rac synergistically enhance the CBP/p 300 -mediated increase of TAD-A activity, indicating the important role CBP/p 300 plays in the integration of T cell activation signals. Since a mutation of CBP abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as wild-type CBP in T cells, functions of CBP/p 300 other than histone acetylation appear to control the NF-AT-dependent transcription in T cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) {{signal transduction}} pathways display remarkable homology to the Toll signaling cascade in Drosophila. To {{address the question}} whether members of the Drosophila Toll pathway are functional in mammalian cells, inactive and constitutively <b>active</b> <b>versions</b> of the protein kinase Pelle and its regulator Tube were expressed in HeLa cells and tested for their impact on IL- 1 -dependent signaling events. The Drosophila proteins failed to induce the IL- 1 -responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB, but selectively activated the IL- 1 -regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), thus resulting in elevated AP- 1 activity. Activation of JNK/AP- 1 activity was seen upon expression of a Pelle mutant lacking its C-terminal half or by a membrane-bound and multimerised Tube protein, showing the functionality of the Drosophila proteins in mammalian cells...|$|R
