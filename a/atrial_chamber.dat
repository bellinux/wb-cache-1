50|$|NKX2.5 {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with GATA4 and TBX5.NKX 2.5 is a transcription factor that regulates heart development from the Cardiac Crescent of the splanchnic mesoderm in humans. NKX2.5 is dependent upon the JAK-STAT pathway and works along with MEF2, HAND1, and HAND2 transcription factors to direct heart looping during early heart development. NKX2.5 in vertebrates is equivalent to the ‘tinman’ gene in Drosophila and directly activates the MEF2 gene to control cardiomyocyte differentiation. NKX2.5 operates in a positive feedback loop with GATA transcription factors to regulate cardiomyocyte formation. NKX2.5 influences HAND1 and HAND2 transcription factors that control the essential asymmetrical development of the heart’s ventricles. The gene has been show {{to play a role in}} the heart's conduction system, postnatally. NKX2-5 is also involved in the intrinsic mechanisms that decide ventricle and atrial cellular fate. During ventricular chamber formation, NKX2-5 and NKX2-7 are required to maintain cardiomyocyte cellular identity. Repression of either gene results in the differentiating cardiomyocytes to move towards <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> identity. The Nbx2.5 mutation has also been associated with preeclampsia; though research is still being conducting in this area.|$|E

DESIGN [...] Prospective study. SETTING [...] Department of internal medicine in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] Five control subjects, six patients with essential hypertension, and 11 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. INTERVENTIONS [...] Measurement of left atrial pressure by a tip micromanometer and of real-time left atrial volume from left atrial cineangiograms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Left atrial stiffness constant determined by fitting the ascending limb of the v loop of the left atrial pressure-volume relation to an exponential curve. RESULTS [...] The mean (SD) left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> stiffness constant was significantly larger in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in controls (0. 063 (0. 018) v 0. 041 (0. 006), p < 0. 05) and was correlated with left ventricular wall thickness (r = 0. 560, p < 0. 01). Left atrial reservoir volume (left atrial emptying volume before atrial contraction) was significantly smaller in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in the controls (7. 3 (2. 1) v 12. 5 (4. 4) ml/m 2, p < 0. 01) and was inversely correlated with the left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> stiffness constant (r = - 0. 598, p < 0. 01). The cardiac index was inversely correlated with the left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> stiffness constant (r = - 0. 542, p < 0. 01).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe role of atrial myocytes and {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) changes in <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> remodeling was studied in a canine model {{of heart failure}} (HF). BackgroundCardiac remodeling is a key process mediating the progression of HF. Studies of the structural mechanisms of cardiac remodeling have been limited to the left ventricle. The structural alterations associated with <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> remodeling in evolving HF have not been studied. MethodsAge- and weight-matched dogs were subjected to right ventricular pacing (240 beats/min) for one and three weeks to produce early and severe HF, respectively. Atrial tissues were assessed for myocyte and ECM changes. ResultsRight atrial and left atrial (LA) pressures were significantly increased in early and severe HF. The LA wall tension index was significantly increased at both HF stages by 116 % and 443 %, respectively. Atrial collagen synthesis and degradation were significantly increased in severe HF. Gelatinase activity was significantly increased at both early and severe stages of HF. Gelatin zymography showed increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) - 9 with early HF and increased MMP- 2 with severe HF. The LA wall tension index was significantly correlated with gelatinase activity and collagen synthesis. Although total atrial collagen content was not changed, disarray of collagen fibers was observed. Atrial myocyte hypertrophy without evidence of apoptosis was also present in severe HF. ConclusionsThere is marked <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> remodeling in canine pacing-induced HF, which is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy and dynamic collagen turnover.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} study was to assess left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> and appendage function after internal atrial defibrillation of atrial fibrillation and to evaluate {{the time course of}} recovery. Background. External cardioversion of atrial fibrillation may result in left atrial appendage dysfunction (“stunning”) and may promote thrombus formation. In contrast to external cardioversion, internal atrial defibrillation utilizes lower energies; however, it is unknown whether the use of lower energies may avoid stunning of the left atrial appendage. Methods. Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography were performed in 20 patients 24 h before and 1 and 7 days after internal atrial defibrillation to assess both left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> and appendage function. Transthoracic echocardiography was again performed 28 days after internal atrial defibrillation to assess left atrial function. The incidence and degree of spontaneous echo contrast accumulation (range 1 + to 4 +) was noted, and peak emptying velocities of the left atrial appendage were measured before and after internal atrial defibrillation. To determine left atrial mechanical function, peak A wave velocities were obtained from transmitral flow velocity profiles. Results. Sinus rhythm was restored in all patients. The mean ± SD peak A wave velocities increased gradually after cardioversion, from 0. 47 ± 0. 16 m/s at 24 h to 0. 61 ± 0. 13 m/s after 7 days (p < 0. 05) and 0. 63 ± 0. 13 m/s after 4 weeks. Peak emptying velocities of the left atrial appendage were 0. 37 ± 0. 16 m/s before internal atrial defibrillation, decreased significantly after internal atrial defibrillation to 0. 23 ± 0. 1 m/s at 24 h (p < 0. 01) and then recovered to 0. 49 ± 0. 23 m/s (p < 0. 01) after 7 days. The corresponding values for the degree of spontaneous echo contrast were 1. 2 ± 1. 2 before internal atrial defibrillation versus 2. 0 ± 1. 0 (p < 0. 01) and 1. 1 ± 1. 3 (p < 0. 01) 1 and 7 days after cardioversion, respectively. One patient developed a new thrombus in the left atrial appendage, and another had a thromboembolic event after internal atrial defibrillation. Conclusions. Internal atrial defibrillation causes depressed left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> and appendage function and may result in the subacute accumulation of spontaneous echo contrast and development of new thrombi after cardioversion. These findings have important clinical implications for anticoagulation therapy before and after low energy internal atrial defibrillation in patients with atrial fibrillation.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the role of pulmonary vein sleeve cells (PVCs) in ageing-related heart defects such as atrial fibrillation. During atrial fibrillation the atrial chambers do not follow action potentials propagating from the sino-atrial node, but rather display rapid (300 Hz) electrical signals that prevent coordinated atrial contraction. Although atrial fibrillation is not immediately fatal, it is debilitating because the atrial component of blood pumping is absent. Moreover, the pooling of blood within the atrial chambers can lead thrombus formation. Blood clots can travel from the heart to the brain and cause strokes. PVCs are present outside the heart, and form a sheath around the pulmonary veins. It is well established that PVCs are a source of ectopic action potentials that can propagate into the heart via the left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber.</b> Ablation procedures that electrically isolate the PVCs at their junctions with the left <b>atrial</b> <b>chamber</b> are commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation. Ageing is established as the biggest risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation, and this is most probably due to altered ion homeostasis and the generation of ectopic electrical activity in PVCs. We have used electron microscopy, fluorescence imaging and immunostaining to explore the ageing-related changes in PVC structure and function that may underlie the generation of ectopic action potentials. We compared the responses to electrical field stimulation and the level of spontaneous calcium activity in PVCs from young and aged mice (24 vs. 3 month-old C 57 BL/J 6 mice), and found that PVCs from 24 month-old mice are less likely to respond to electrical field stimulation than those from 3 month-old mice (9. 4 ± 9. 4...|$|E

The contribution of the inflow tract to the definitive <b>atrial</b> <b>chambers</b> has remained enigmatic {{largely because of the}} lack of molecular markers that permit unambiguous identification of this myocardial domain. We now report that the genes encoding atrial natriuretic factor, myosin light chain (MLC) 3 F, MLC 2 V, and Pitx- 2, and transgenic mouse lines expressing nlacZ under the control of regulatory sequences of the mouse MLC 1 F/ 3 F gene, display regionalized patterns of expression in the atrial component of the developing mouse heart.
