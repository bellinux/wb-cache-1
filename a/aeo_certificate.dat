By introducing the voluntary Authorised Economic Operator certificate on the market, the European government makes their intentions clear to distinguish trusted, law obliging organisations from dubious operating organisations. In theory, this system allows a lowering of the trade boundaries for the certified businesses while the local customs can control more effectively the noncertified organisations at the same time. Companies are enticed to obtain the AEO by certain benefits the certificate grants. The most notable advantage is the possibility to avoid customs controls. This in turn can improve the reliability and throughput time of a company’s supply chain. In order to establish if the <b>AEO</b> <b>certificate</b> can form a valuable addition to a company, three research objectives were founded; identify the level of awareness among noncertified organisations, evaluate the representativeness of the proclaimed benefits of the certificate and asses the possible motivations to acquire the AEO. A literature review has been executed {{in order to obtain}} information for the research objectives. In addition, a questionnaire has been distributed among the European sub companies of the Makhteshim Agan Industry (MAI) organisation. All the participants of this survey are entitled to obtain the certificate but have not done that until now. From the findings of the research it appeared that among the European countries a different level of support and certifying procedures are applied. This finding is further supported by the contrasting spread of the AEO holders throughout the European Community. This outcome can form one probable cause why there is a low level of in depth awareness and a significant large hesitation among organisations to obtain the certificate. Furthermore, the proclaimed benefits of the <b>AEO</b> <b>certificate</b> appears to be less relevant to organisations then the risk of losing earlier obtained benefits for faster customs procedures. This risk formed in addition the main motivation for organisations to obtain the certificate. From the findings it became clear the <b>AEO</b> <b>certificate</b> is not yet in its projected state. However the benefits it provides for the government are so large {{that it will be a}} matter of time before the voluntary certificate turns into an unavoidable asset. Business Schoo...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to {{approach}} and explain the concept of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) and evaluation of individual benefits of the <b>AEO</b> <b>certificate</b> holders. It explains basic terms such as the European Community, third countries, international supply chain, electronic Customs, AEO status, and for whom the status is determined. To better understand the status, the theoretical part describes the procedure to get the authorization, criteria to get the authorization, authorization procedure itself, types of the AEO certificates and their particular benefits. More {{detailed description of the}} particular benefits {{can be found in the}} practical section of the work. In this part of the work the various benefits of the AEO certification are further analyze and explained. The work explaines their use in practice and also describes, whether the benefits are used by the questioned companies. Finally the overall assessment of the status of AEO is described...|$|E

Currently, there is a need of developing solutions which aim at facilitating flow of goods, simultaneously ensuring security against the increasing number of threats related to e. g. terrorist attacks, illegal smuggling, thefts and tax frauds. The article presents institution of an authorized operator – Authorized Economic Operator (AEO), introduced on the territory of the European Union in 2008. The discourse demonstrates influence of functioning <b>AEO</b> <b>certificates</b> on security of international supply chains with the particular attention drawn on the importance of AEO institution for Polish operators...|$|R

Recently, the realisation of this goal has become more visible with the emerging concept of the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO). Businesses in the member states can apply for the <b>AEO</b> <b>certificate</b> from government. The aim for granting AEO is to create possible 'win-win' situation with increased trade efficiency and lowered administrative burden. However, without proper selection mechanism, this policy can be misunderstood/misused due to asymmetric information {{between the government and}} businesses. In this paper, we focus on modelling the cause and effect of the adverse selection in the Government-to-Business (G 2 B) relationship building. We argue that an IT-enabled risk assessment approach can effectively eliminate the G 2 B information asymmetry and solve the adverse selection problem. The business model of AEO assessment is built to give a real-life example on how IT-enabled risk management approach can help with collaborative G 2 B relationships building. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Building {{collaborative}} {{relationships with}} trusted businesses {{is a long-term}} strategy for EU governments. Recently, for the EU Tax and Customs Ad-ministration (TCA), the realization of this goal has become more visible with the emerging concept of the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO). Businesses in the member states can apply for the <b>AEO</b> <b>certificate.</b> When it is being granted, simplified control procedures and trade facilitation will be provided by the TCA. A possible “win-win situation ” can be achieved, with increased trade efficiency and lowered administrative burden. However, without proper selec-tion of trusted business partners, governments may be worse off due to the ad-verse selection problem caused by information asymmetry. In this paper, we analyze the cause and effect of the adverse selection in the Government-to-Business relationship building. Further, we show that an IT enabled risk as-sessment approach can effectively eliminate the G 2 B information asymmetry and solve the adverse selection problem. The AEO assessment approach of DutchTCA is analysed to give a real life application on how IT is enabling the general risk management approach of the DutchTCA...|$|E
