5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone.

Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E

25|$|Anthocyanins {{may be used}} as pH {{indicators}} {{because their}} color changes with pH; they are red or pink in acidic solutions (pH < 7), purple in neutral solutions (pH ~ 7), greenish-yellow in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions</b> (pH > 7), and colorless in very <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions,</b> where the pigment is completely reduced.|$|R
5|$|The largest {{chemical}} {{diversity among}} actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, {{but also in}} the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 18–22 by 5–5.6μm. H.nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae with clamp connections. In the flesh, these hyphae are thick-walled and highly branched, measuring up to 10μm in diameter; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner (up to 6μm wide) and less branched. A chemical test {{can be used}} to help identify H.nidulans: all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> is applied. Dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH), is often used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E

30|$|It {{was well}} known that {{single-crystal}} silicon shows strong anisotropic etching behavior in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions.</b> Based on the electrochemical model proposed by Seidel et al. [21], the anisotropic etching behavior of silicon was mainly attributed to the differences on {{the density of the}} dangling bond as well as the structure and energy level of the backbond on the silicon surface. When the density of the dangling bond and the energy level of the backbond are high, the etching rate of the silicon surface in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions</b> is fast. Since { 100 } surfaces show the highest dangling bond density and a relatively high backbond energy level, the etching rate of { 100 } surfaces in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions</b> are the fastest. As a comparison, with one dangling bond and three backbonds per surface atom, the { 111 } surfaces show the lowest dangling bond density and the slowest etching rate in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions.</b> Finally, even with the similar dangling bond density as { 111 } surfaces, the { 110 } surfaces show a relatively higher backbond energy level and higher etching rate than { 111 } surfaces.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60°C in an <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground {{with little or no}} washing or hulling.|$|E
25|$|Because wood-tar {{creosote}} is {{used for}} its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with {{a higher proportion of}} those chemicals to other phenolics. The creosote can be obtained by distilling the wood tar and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|E

25|$|In aqueous solution, thorium occurs {{exclusively}} as the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, {{which has}} tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th–O bond distance is (245±1)pm, the coordination number of Th4+ is (10.8±0.5), the effective charge is 3.82 and the second coordination sphere contains 13.4 water molecules. The Th4+ ion is relatively large and is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å.

25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel is {{not considered to be}} a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> bath.|$|E
25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a colorimetric method used in clinical chemistry to determine creatinine levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of creatinine and picric acid in an <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution.</b> The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine, however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for creatinine, is still widely employed as the method of choice for creatinine testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} medical laboratory. It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new reference methods for creatinine analysis into the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Geopolymerization is a {{chemical}} reaction process, reacting SiO₂ and Al₂O₃ with <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions,</b> which can transform aluminosilicate solids or particles to polymer materials. Geopolymers have many engineering {{applications such as}} cementation binders for construction and solidification or encapsulation of hazardous heavy metals. Mine tailings mainly consist of SiO₂ and Al₂O₃. Theoretically, mine tailings {{can be used as}} source materials for geopolymerization. However, for most researchers, they use fly ash, metakaolin or furnace slag as source minerals, because these minerals are much more reactive with <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions.</b> Mine tailings are naturally-forming minerals and are considered to be inert in geopolymerization. How are mine tailings to be activated through different reaction conditions? We conducted several tentative or preliminary experiments to study the geopolymerization process step by step. We tried different methods to react mine tailings with <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions.</b> Mine tailings were submerged into <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions</b> in a plastic bucket for 6 days in room temperature (20 - 25 °C). We wanted mine tailings to be activated by soaking. The results were not satisfying. Then we tried to react mine tailings with <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions</b> at 60 °C and 90 °C. After analyzing, we found that the results were not satisfying either. So, we conducted simplified geopolymerization experiments in order to better understand the chemical reaction mechanism. Pure SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, which were two major reactants, were employed to simplify and simulate the geopolymerization process. We drew some useful conclusions such as that geopolymerization took place at elevated temperatures; Al₂O₃ almost did not react with <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions</b> at low temperatures, etc. We conducted experiments at elevated temperatures (150 °C, 180 °C, 210 °C). Different levels of pressure (5 MPa, 10 MPa, 20 MPa) were applied to make compact specimens. After many attempts, the results were successful. The highest mechanical strength was about 20 MPa. Most importantly, we obtained polymers produced from geopolymerzation, which could be seen by naked eyes. The experiment techniques such as scanning electron microstructure (SEM) imaging and X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and unconfined compression tests (UCS) were applied to study the geopolymerization reaction mechanism and the feasibility of using mine tailing-based geopolymers as construction materials...|$|R
