25|$|Pottery {{has been}} made in the town since far back into pre-Hispanic times. Some of the oldest pottery found here is {{associated}} with the Olmec culture. One distinctive technique to the areas pottery is using cattail fluff <b>as</b> <b>temper,</b> mixing it into the clay. Pottery items include flowerpots, storage jars, figures, cooking pots, comals, jars, dishes and more. Many are glazed in various colors. To honor the tradition there is a Museo del Alfarero or Potters’ Museum in the Capilla de la Natividad and a festival dedicated to the craft. The Feria del Barro, also known as the Festival Cultural de Tlayacapan was initiated by Cornelio Santamaría and is held each November. The 2009 Feria de Barro featured singer Susana Harp and groups such as Leones de la Sierra as well as the native Banda de Tlayacapan. The festival not only showcases the area’s pottery but also has expositions of photography, other crafts and children’s events.|$|E

2500|$|Shell-tempered pottery {{has long}} been known to exist in the middle and lower Mississippi Valley by both amateur {{collectors}} as well as professional archeologists. [...] "Grave diggers" [...] and amateur collectors have plundered many Mississippian mounds for the fine funerary effigies and other vessels placed as grave goods within mounds and surrounding village areas. Early professional surveys in the valley noted the preponderance of shell-tempered wares in large village sites throughout the valley alluvial plains. Mississippian pottery is easily distinguished from earlier Woodland period pottery. Woodland vessels tend to have thicker walls, flat or conical bases and a large amount of either coarse sand or grog used <b>as</b> <b>temper.</b> Mississippian vessels generally have thinner vessel walls, obvious white flecks of shell temper and round-bottomed pottery forms. For decades archeologists have examined, sorted, described and stored Woodland sherds from those of Mississippian vessels with relative ease.|$|E
2500|$|Ceramics {{are often}} used to {{identify}} archaeological cultures. The type of temper (or mix of tempers) used helps to distinguish the ceramics produced by different cultures during particular time periods. Grog, sand, and sandstone were all used by Ancestral Pueblo people and other Southwestern cultures. Crushed bone was used <b>as</b> <b>temper</b> {{in at least some}} ceramics at a number of sites in Texas. In the Southeastern United States, the earliest ceramics were tempered with fiber such as Spanish moss and palmetto leaves. In Louisiana, fiber as tempering was replaced first by grog and later by shell. In peninsular Florida and coastal Georgia sand replaced fiber as tempering. Still later, freshwater sponge spicules became an important temper in the [...] "chalky ware" [...] of the St. Johns culture in northeastern Florida. Locally produced ceramics of the Lucayan people in the Bahamas were characterized by crushed conch shell tempering, as opposed to the quartz sand-tempered ware imported from Hispaniola.|$|E

60|$|The {{beginning}} of the battle as recorded in the last chapter took place on a Friday,--Friday, 11th November,--and consequently two entire days intervened before the debate could be renewed. There seemed to prevail an opinion during this interval that Mr. Gresham had been imprudent. It was acknowledged by all men that no finer speech than that delivered by him had ever been heard {{within the walls of}} that House. It was acknowledged also that as regarded the question of oratory Mr. Daubeny had failed signally. But the strategy of the Minister was said to have been excellent, whereas that of the ex-Minister was very loudly condemned. There is nothing so prejudicial to a cause <b>as</b> <b>temper.</b> This man is declared to be unfit for any position of note, because he always shows temper. Anything can be done with another man,--he can be made to fit almost any hole,--because he has his temper under command. It may, indeed, be assumed that a man who loses his temper while he is speaking is endeavouring to speak the truth such as he believes it to be, and again it may be assumed that a man who speaks constantly without losing his temper is not always entitled to the same implicit faith. Whether or not this be a reason the more for preferring the calm and tranquil man may be doubted; but the calm and tranquil man is preferred for public services. We want practical results rather than truth. A clear head is worth more than an honest heart. In a matter of horseflesh of what use is it to have all manner of good gifts if your horse won't go whither you want him, and refuses to stop when you bid him? Mr. Gresham had been very indiscreet, and had especially sinned in opposing the Address without arrangements with his party.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of three block-shaped beef blends (lean, fat, and 50 : 50 lean/fat mixture), tempered using radio-frequency (RF) heating is presented. Post tempering temperature distribution indicated a minor temperature gradient within the blocks, suggesting a relatively uniform temperature distribution. The heating {{rate of the}} three blends decreased <b>as</b> <b>tempering</b> time progressed with the highest rates being observed in the leanest blends. Power absorption (P abs) for the lean and 50 : 50 mixture increased <b>as</b> <b>tempering</b> time increased but the high fat blend showed an initial increase before plateauing and then declining slightly. While intrinsic power efficiency {{was found to be}} satisfactory, overall power efficiency, evaluated on the basis of consumed power, was 50 %, though it is important to emphasize the system was not fully optimized.
