Bournemouth has the third largest community of surfers in the UK and in 2009 an artificial surf reef, one of only four in the world, was constructed there. The reef failed to deliver the promised grade 5 wave, suffered a series of delays and ran over budget, finally costing £3.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{is located}} on the western side of central {{southern}} Great Britain. To the north and west is the Irish Sea, and to the south is the Bristol Channel. The English counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire lie to the east. Much of the border with England roughly follows the line of the ancient earthwork known as Offa's Dyke. The large island of Anglesey lies off the northwest coast, separated from mainland Wales by the Menai Strait, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of smaller islands.|$|E

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|The {{county is}} drained by several {{important}} rivers which flow southwards into the Bristol Channel, especially the River Towy, and its several tributaries, {{such as the}} River Cothi. The Towy is the longest river flowing entirely within Wales. Other rivers include the Loughor (which forms the eastern boundary with Glamorgan), the River Gwendraeth and the River Taf. The River Teifi forms much of the border between Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of towns in the Teifi Valley which have communities living {{on either side of}} the river and hence in different counties. Carmarthenshire has a long coastline which is deeply cut by the estuaries of the Loughor in the east and the Gwendraeth, Tywi and Taf, which enter the sea on the east side of Carmarthen Bay. The coastline includes notable beaches such as Pendine Sands and Cefn Sidan sands, and large areas of foreshore are uncovered at low tide along the Loughor and Towy estuaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} been {{inhabited}} since pre-Roman times. It {{was used as}} a holiday destination in Roman Britain for occupants of Camulodunum (Colchester). Fishing has been a key industry on the island since then, particularly oysters, and along with tourism makes up {{a significant part of the}} island's economy. The Church of St Peter & St Paul in West Mersea is thought to have existed since the 7th century, while the Church of St Edmund in East Mersea dates from around the 12th or 13th centuries. The island became popular with smugglers from the 16th to the 19th century. It became a focal point for troops in both world wars, and a number of observation posts can still be found on the island. Tourism remains popular, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of beach huts and holiday parks on the island. A week-long festival of boat racing, Mersea Week, takes place every summer.|$|E

25|$|The {{late medieval}} German school survives into the German Renaissance, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of printed 16th-century manuals (notably the one by Joachim Meyer, 1570).

Wrestling comes {{to be seen as}} an ignoble pursuit proper for the lower classes and until its 19th-century revival as a modern sport becomes restricted to folk wrestling.|$|E

On shunting signals, where speeds are much lower, a miniature version of the alphanumeric route indicator is used.|$|E
