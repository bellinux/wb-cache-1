5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe had a right to assert a claim <b>arising</b> <b>out</b> of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E

5|$|This tranquility {{disappeared}} {{when the}} British consul in Rio de Janeiro, William Dougal Christie, nearly sparked {{a war between}} his nation and Brazil. Christie sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands <b>arising</b> <b>out</b> of two minor incidents {{at the end of}} 1861 and beginning of 1862. The first was the sinking of a commercial barque on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul after which its goods were pillaged by local inhabitants. The second was the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio.|$|E
5|$|A {{reward of}} £2.5 million was also offered, {{including}} from the News of the World, Rowling, Branson, Green, and a Scottish businessman, Stephen Winyard. In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 {{in the form}} of libel damages <b>arising</b> <b>out</b> of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively. In 2011 Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, was serialized by The Sun and The Sunday Times, both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million. In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000. As of February 2017 it had seven directors, including the McCanns.|$|E
5|$|Market {{research}} conducting during 1997 {{revealed that}} airlines wanted a smaller {{aircraft in the}} 70-80-seat range. As the project proceeded, there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus. China wanted a larger aircraft than originally envisioned. In addition, there were difficulties <b>arising</b> <b>out</b> of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak business case. STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project, in 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year. The A318 {{is believed to have}} emerged from the AE31X project though an Airbus-only project, named the A319M5 in 1995, began before the AE31X cancellation.|$|E

5|$|This {{period of}} calm {{came to an}} end when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an {{ultimatum}} containing abusive demands <b>arising</b> <b>out</b> of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The Brazilian government refused to yield, and the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. The Brazilian government then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E

Irish Palladian Country houses often feature robust Rococo plasterwork, frequently {{executed by the}} Lafranchini brothers, an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin {{was built in the}} 18th century that it set a Georgian stamp on the city; however <b>arising</b> <b>out</b> of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin {{was one of the few}} cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.|$|E
