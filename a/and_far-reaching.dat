5|$|Plutarch's {{account of}} the revolt {{suggests}} that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom, and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war, in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome itself. The Third Servile War had significant <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their subsequent actions as Consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions {{and contributed to the}} eventual transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E

Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.|$|E
25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power.

He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E

After his bill was defeated, Representative Samuel Shellabarger of Ohio drafted another bill, only {{slightly}} less sweeping than Butler's, that successfully passed both houses and became law upon Grant's signature on April 20. Along with Republican Senator Charles Sumner, Butler proposed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, a seminal <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> law banning racial discrimination in public accommodations.

However, throughout the Late Middle Ages, the Oberland, {{as a whole}} or in part, revolted several times against Bernese authority.

25|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th century, {{fundamental}} internal reforms were attempted in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as it slid into extinction. The reform activity, initially promoted by the magnate Czartoryski family faction known as the Familia, provoked a hostile reaction and military response from neighboring powers, but it did create conditions that fostered economic improvement. The most populous urban center, {{the capital city of}} Warsaw, replaced Danzig (Gdańsk) as the leading trade center, and the importance of the more prosperous urban social classes increased. The last decades of the independent Commonwealth's existence were characterized by aggressive reform movements <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art and the evolution of the social and political system.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} {{opposition to the}} concordancia came from the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, MNR). The first party with widespread support in Bolivian history, the MNR had a membership that included intellectuals and both white-collar and blue-collar workers. It was founded in 1941 by {{a small group of}} intellectual dissidents from the middle and upper classes and represented persons {{from a wide range of}} political persuasions who were united by their discontent with the status quo. Among its leaders were Víctor Paz Estenssoro, a professor of economics; Hernán Siles Zuazo, the son of former President Siles Reyes; and several influential writers. The party's program included nationalization of all of Bolivia's natural resources <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> social reforms. Its anti-Semitic statements resulted not only in the imprisonment of MNR leaders but also in charges by the United States government that MNR was under the influence of Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Newton's tract De motu corporum in gyrum, {{which he}} sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what are {{now known as the}} three laws of Kepler, {{assuming}} an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections. It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium. The contents of De motu so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work. The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.|$|E
25|$|Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that dramatically increased the regulatory {{power of the}} federal government. It remains {{as one of the}} most important <b>and</b> <b>far-reaching</b> cases concerning the New Deal, and set a precedent for an expansive reading of the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the business interests that financed the legal challenge all the way to the Supreme Court was to convince the court to declare the entire federal crop support program unconstitutional and thereby end it. Unfortunately for Filburn and his backers, by the time the case reached the high court, eight out of the nine justices had been appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal legislation. In addition, the case was heard during wartime, shortly after the United States had entered World War II. Not surprisingly, the Filburn decision supported the president's policy, holding that the Constitution allowed the federal government to regulate economic activity that was only indirectly related to interstate commerce.|$|E
