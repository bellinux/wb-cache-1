After being duly sworn in by U.S. Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock as the first U.S. Air Mail pilot in history, Ovington took off in his own American-made Bleriot Queen tractor-type monoplane, Dragonfly, at 5:26 PM and dropped the bag of mail over Mineola six minutes later from an altitude of 500 feet. Unfortunately the bag broke when it hit the ground, but all of the mail was eventually recovered and forwarded by regular channels with the cancellation reading [...] "AEROPLANE STATION No.1 – GARDEN CITY ESTATES, N.Y."

50|$|In that month, President Franklin D.

The project, known as the Army Air Corps Mail Operation (AACMO), divided the country into three zones, with Jones placed in charge of the Eastern Zone. He established his headquarters at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, and later at Mitchel Field on Long Island. Flight operations commenced on February 19 in severe winter weather. By February 24, there were three crashes in the Eastern Zone, two of them fatal. Jones instituted a number of operational restrictions in the interest of safety, but these were often disregarded by his pilots, many of whom were inexperienced young reservists. AACMO continued into June 1934, and Jones' report of his zone's activities was published and widely read.|$|E

5000|$|Norton Field {{was located}} in an area {{southwest}} of present East Broad Street, Fairway Boulevard, and Hamilton Road in Whitehall, Ohio, just south {{of what is now}} John Glenn Columbus International Airport. It was dedicated on 30 June 1923, in a ceremony attended by top American ace and Columbus native Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. The flying field was established at the urging of Aero Club of Columbus, who lobbied the War Department for its creation. The 100 acre property, with dimensions of 2000 x 2250 ft, received a 10-year lease, secured from Jim Lamp and paid for by the Pure Oil Company, according to Ohio Aviation News (Fall 2000). This property was then provided to the War Department. [...] "For $1 a year as the community’s part of the deal, Norton Field was equipped by the War Department with 2 steel hangars, a fueling dock & a beacon light on a tower." [...] The first delivery of <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> Columbus occurred on the day of its dedication. Norton Field became the headquarters for the 308th Observation Squadron, made up of local reservists, many of whom were members of the Aero Club.|$|E

50|$|The NMCA is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} airline industry museum in the United States, and is poised to become the nation's premier center for airline history and research, attracting visitors from around the globe. It is being designed to become a major tourism attraction and economic generator for the region, and {{to serve as a}} cultural and educational amenity for residents and visitors alike. The Museum will take a broad look at all aspects of the airline industry, not just one particular airline or airport, covering everything from the birth of the airline industry to modern labor relations; from <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> air cargo; highlighting every job in the industry and its value. Most importantly, it will preserve the artifacts and stories {{of the men and women}} who built the industry to what it is today. In 2007, after years of research and planning, the Museum selected and subsequently announced south metro Atlanta as its permanent home, followed by a major operating grant award from Clayton County, Georgia to assist with planning, research & other operating needs. As a result of growing public demand, and interest from the aviation community, the first Interim Headquarters & Research Air-Chive was opened in Forest Park, Georgia in March 2008. The Interim H.Q. was designed to act as both temporary museum and sales center to give the public an idea of what to expect further down the road, and immediately became a success.|$|E

25|$|For {{several years}} the new field was used mainly for {{training}} and aerobatic flights.
