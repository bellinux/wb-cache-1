Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress to the next level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines.

500|$|The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, {{intended}} as a lightweight and agile <b>aerial</b> <b>platform</b> with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the rear stabilizer producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag. [...] Being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves maneuverability, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. [...] A pair of air brakes are located {{on the sides of}} the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance. It is capable of flying at a 70–80 degrees angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|As the Gazelle {{continued}} to serve into the 21st century, several major modernisation and upgrade programs were undertaken, commonly adding new avionics {{to increase the}} aircraft's capabilities. [...] Aerotec group offered an overhaul package to existing operators, which comprised upgraded ballistic protection, night vision goggles, new munitions including rockets and machine guns, and 3D navigational displays; as of 2013, Egypt {{is said to be}} interested in upgrading their domestically built Gazelles. QinetiQ developed a Direct Voice Input (DVI) system for the Gazelle, the DVI system enables voice control over many aspects of the aircraft, lowering the demands placed upon the crew. In September 2011, QinetiQ and Northrop Grumman proposed outfitting former British Gazelles with autonomous flight management systems derived from the Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout, converting them into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s to meet a Royal Navy requirement for an unmanned maritime <b>aerial</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Of great {{significance}} to those pioneers working toward powered flight, Hargrave successfully lifted {{himself off the}} ground under a train of four of his box kites at Stanwell Park Beach on 12 November 1894. Aided by James Swain, the caretaker at his property, the kite line was moored via a spring balance to two sandbags (see image). Hargrave carried an anemometer and clinometer aloft to measure windspeed and {{the angle of the}} kite line. He rose 16 feet in a wind speed of 21mph. This experiment was widely reported and established the box kite as a stable <b>aerial</b> <b>platform.</b> Hargrave claimed that [...] "The particular steps gained are the demonstration that an extremely simple apparatus can be made, carried about, and flown by one man; and that a safe means of making an ascent with a flying machine, of trying the same without any risk of accident, and descending, is now at the service of any experimenter who wishes to use it." [...] This was seen by Abbott Lawrence Rotch of the meteorological observatory at Harvard University who constructed a kite from the particulars in Engineering. A modification was adopted by the weather bureau of the United States and the use of box-kites for meteorological observations became widespread. The principle was applied to gliders, and in October 1906 Alberto Santos-Dumont used the box-kite principle in his aeroplane to make his first flight. Until 1909 the box-kite aeroplane was the usual type in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The HAWE system [...] is {{developed}} from Tiago Pardal's idea. This system {{consists of a}} pumping cycle {{similar to that of}} kite systems.

50|$|Although China was {{satisfied}} {{with the performance of}} its own Changfeng series land attack cruise missile, an inherent problem with this turbojet powered Changfeng (missile) meant that the size and weight of the missile were too large to be carried by <b>aerial</b> <b>platforms</b> in Chinese inventory and the range of the missile was inadequate.
