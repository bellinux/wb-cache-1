The effects of external electric fields at the electric field intensity related to streamer initiation and propagation on the bond lengths, dipole moment, total energy, infrared spectra, and orbital energy of the triolein molecule are investigated using density functional theory (DFT).

The results show that the bond lengths, dipole moments, total energy, and infrared spectra change obviously under external electric fields.
