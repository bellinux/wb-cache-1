Now in regard of the universal there happened little that did not first or last <b>arrive</b> <b>here...</b> And those news-mongers, as they called them, did not only take the boldness to weigh the public but most intrinsic actions of the state, which some courtier or other did betray to this society.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish {{arrived in}} the 1520s. The first Spaniard to <b>arrive</b> <b>here</b> {{is said to have}} been Gonzalo de Umbria, sent by Hernán Cortés to explore the area to see if there was any gold. The conquest caused the native peoples to mostly abandon the area, and it is not known where they went. Those left to provide tribute were known in the Mexican {{highlands}} for their cotton shawls and decorated conch shells. The oldest document with Zihuatanejo’s name is called the Matricula de Tributos (Record of Tribute). Today the local dialect has been lost and the only trace of the native population is a small archaeological site that was explored by INAH in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Playa Escobilla is {{considered}} to the sanctuary of the Olive Ridley turtle as {{a large number of}} these creatures <b>arrive</b> <b>here</b> to lay their eggs. It is a large green area where forest meets a lagoon. Canoe and guided tours are available to see the areas flora and fauna. The area also has a large organic farm which grows crops such as hibiscus flowers for sale, as well as a restaurant and cabins for rent. Tours generally end with visiting the turtle nests located on the beach. About once a month, up to thousands of turtles will arrive on these beaches to lay their eggs. After this occurs, there are releases of large numbers of baby turtles which have been guarded and incubated by the sanctuary volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} the fall of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), Spaniards arrived in Oaxaca. Moctezuma II had {{informed}} Hernando Cortes that the area had gold. In addition, when Zapotec leaders heard about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, they sent an offer of an alliance. Several captains and representatives were sent to the area to explore the area, looking for gold, and routes to the Pacific to establish trade routes to Asian spice markets. The most prominent of Cortés' captains to <b>arrive</b> <b>here</b> were Gonzalo de Sandoval, Francisco de Orozco and Pedro de Alvarado. They overcame the main Aztec military stronghold only four months {{after the fall of}} Tenochtitlan. Their reports about the area prompted Cortés to seek the title of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca from the Spanish Crown.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of such a}} wave can be visualized by its {{action on}} a ring of freely floating particles. A sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic, rhythmic fashion (animated image to the right). Since Einstein's equations are non-linear, arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition, making their description difficult. However, for weak fields, a linear approximation can be made. Such linearized gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves {{that are expected to}} <b>arrive</b> <b>here</b> on Earth from far-off cosmic events, which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by [...] or less. Data analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be Fourier decomposed.|$|E
