5|$|The FAA {{had already}} warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these {{aircraft}} were inadequately equipped to safely cross the Atlantic. On 13 May 2006, the FAA refused permission for Biman flight BG001 (Dhaka–Brussels–JFK) to enter its airspace, citing safety {{concerns over the}} ailing DC–10 aircraft used on the route. The flight was diverted to Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada, where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey. Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft and gave it <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers.

5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> of health.

When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> of health from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E

50|$|Sports' {{tort law}} extends into other less obvious areas. Team doctors could {{be liable for}} medical malpractice, a form of negligence, for giving a player <b>a</b> false <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> of health so the player may {{continue}} to perform. A player who purposefully causes bodily harm to another athlete, coach, or spectator may be guilty of committing an intentional tort along with a criminal act of assault and battery. The law of defamation protects a person's good character or reputation. The publication of false information about a well-known athlete ("public figure") may be actionable if it was published with a reckless disregard for the truth or actual malice.

25|$|In 2008, for {{the sixth}} {{consecutive}} year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched Josh Beckett in his season debut. In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Halladay was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to {{walk back to the}} dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the 2008 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of the Indians. He also led the AL with 9 complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posted a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee's 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.|$|E

40|$|A tele-medical {{approach}} for monitoring and detecting prolonging QT-intervals via cellular equipments is proposed in this paper. Currently, the procedures for detecting Longed QT Syndrome (LQTS) involves taking a 1 time preliminary prognosis {{followed by a}} comprehensive long time hospital or laboratory bound monitoring; the latter is only conducted {{if and only if}} the former is tested positive. However, if the preliminary prognosis fails due to the absence of the symptoms during the instance of testing, the subject may be declared with <b>a</b> false <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> of health. In this modern day and age where telemedicine is becoming a more important aspect of conventional medicine, it is sensible that the conventional methods be augmented with ambulatory long-term monitoring to better detect LQTS for people suspected of it. The QTc-Observer (QTO or Q 2) is developed to monitor specifically QT intervals for the detection of LQTS. Built on top of the existing MobiCare System [1] and a newly developed QT/QTc trend interval measure algorithm [2], the Q 2 is connected to an all-day monitoring center for continuous observations by medical professionals...|$|R

500|$|Following {{his arrival}} in January 1967, Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker's new programmes, becoming, the Montreal Gazette writes, [...] "a model inmate". He became widely {{respected}} by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward's [...] "patient therapist". [...] "He was helpful to the other patients," [...] Barker told the Globe and Mail, [...] "and they looked up to him." [...] Barker elaborated on this subject {{in an interview with}} the Windsor Star, telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been [...] "one of the most respected therapists in the hospital". Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge, for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute. Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man's progress that they began to take him to lectures at Ontario Police College in Aylmer, where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation's potential. After about five years at Oak Ridge, the matter of Lamb's liberty was taken up by a five-man Advisory Review Board made up of Ontario Supreme Court Justice Edson Haines, two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb's case, a lawyer and a lay person.

25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee might call for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill may go to what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as <b>a</b> so-called <b>clean</b> <b>bill</b> with <b>a</b> new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|R

Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Minister Greg Combet and Treasurer Wayne Swan released drafts of the key bills in the package on 28 July 2011. The consultation runs until 22 August 2011. The package will give businesses and investors certainty about the carbon price, allowing them to plan new investments in renewable and clean energy technologies. The Clean Energy Legislative Package includes four main bills: The <b>Clean</b> Energy <b>Bill</b> 2011 (which sets up the carbon price mechanism); The <b>Clean</b> Energy Regulator <b>Bill</b> 2011 (which establishes a regulatory body to administer the mechanism); The Climate Change Authority Bill 2011 (which establishes a new Authority to advise the government on the future design of the carbon price mechanism) and The Clean Energy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. The package also includes details of the Government’s Jobs and Competiveness Program, which will assist emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries.  It also includes details of the Energy Security Fund, which will assist electricity generators to ensure energy security. A bill on the Government’s household assistance measures announced is currently being drafted. This legislation {{will be part of the}} whole package that will be introduced into Parliament later this year and will deliver the Government’s commitments to households in full. The Government will provide tax cuts, increases in family payments and higher pensions and other benefits to assist households with the modest cost impacts of a carbon price. Submissions on the Clean Energy Legislative Package can be sent to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency until 5 pm on Monday, 22 August 2011. Note: The legislation to implement household assistance in relation to the carbon price will not be exposed in draft.
