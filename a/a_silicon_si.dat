A cross-section (S 3 in Fig.  1 a) taken from a light blue area of the sky revealed that this zone was based on smalt. EDX analysis pinpointed the predominant presence of calcium (Ca), potassium (K), arsenic (<b>As),</b> <b>silicon</b> (<b>Si),</b> and lead (Pb) as well as minor amounts of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and aluminum (Al). Hence, in these light blue areas smalt was mixed with large amounts of calcite and lead white. The Co and Ni distribution maps of MA-XRF scanning indicated that the dull grey clouds in the sky contained a considerably lower amount of smalt (Fig.  6 e, f), as expected, while, the IRR indicated a higher concentration of carbon black in these darker areas (Fig.  5 a).
