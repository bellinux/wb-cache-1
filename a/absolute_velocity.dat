25|$|In {{practical}} terms, the equivalence of {{inertial reference}} frames means that scientists within a box moving uniformly cannot determine their <b>absolute</b> <b>velocity</b> by any experiment (otherwise the differences {{would set up}} an absolute standard reference frame). According to this definition, supplemented with the constancy {{of the speed of}} light, inertial frames of reference transform among themselves according to the Poincaré group of symmetry transformations, of which the Lorentz transformations are a subgroup. In Newtonian mechanics, which {{can be viewed as a}} limiting case of special relativity in which the speed of light is infinite, inertial frames of reference are related by the Galilean group of symmetries.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fluid}} enters and {{leaves in the}} axial direction, the {{centrifugal}} component in the energy equation does not come into play. Here the compression is fully based on diffusing action of the passages.The diffusing action in stator converts absolute kinetic head of the fluid into rise in pressure. The relative kinetic head in the energy equation is a term that exists {{only because of the}} rotation of the rotor. The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid i.e., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases its velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the <b>absolute</b> <b>velocity</b> of the fluid and the stator converts this into pressure rise. Designing the rotor passage with a diffusing capability can produce a pressure rise in addition to its normal functioning. This produces greater pressure rise per stage which constitutes a stator and a rotor together. This is the reaction principle in turbomachines. If 50% of the pressure rise in a stage is obtained at the rotor section, it is said to have a 50% reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{cephalopods}} {{are thought}} to have produced jets by drawing their body into their shells, as Nautilus does today. Nautilus is also capable of creating a jet by undulations of its funnel; this slower flow of water is more suited to the extraction of oxygen from the water. [...] The jet velocity in Nautilus is much slower than in coleoids, but less musculature and energy is involved in its production. Jet thrust in cephalopods is controlled primarily by the maximum diameter of the funnel orifice (or, perhaps, the average diameter of the funnel) and the diameter of the mantle cavity. Changes {{in the size of the}} orifice are used most at intermediate velocities. The <b>absolute</b> <b>velocity</b> achieved is limited by the cephalopod's requirement to inhale water for expulsion; this intake limits the maximum velocity to eight body-lengths per second, a speed which most cephalopods can attain after two funnel-blows. Water refills the cavity by entering not only through the orifices, but also through the funnel. [...] Squid can expel up to 94% of the fluid within their cavity in a single jet thrust. To accommodate the rapid changes in water intake and expulsion, the orifices are highly flexible and can change their size by a factor of twenty; the funnel radius, conversely, changes only by a factor of around 1.5.|$|E

First, I spend some time setting up a means of thinking about symmetries in this context; second, I consider arguments from the seeming undetectability of <b>absolute</b> <b>velocities</b> to an anti-realism about velocities; and finally, I claim that {{the structure of the}} theory licences (and perhaps requires) us to interpret models which differ only with regards to the <b>absolute</b> <b>velocities</b> of objects as depicting the same physical state of affairs.

60|$|Consider {{next the}} {{movements}} of the planets on their axes. Laplace alleged as one among other evidences of a common genetic cause, that the planets rotate in a direction the same as that in which they go round the Sun, and on axes approximately perpendicular to their orbits. Since he wrote, an exception to this general rule has been discovered in the case of Uranus, and another still more recently in the case of Neptune--judging, at least, from the motions of their respective satellites. This anomaly has been thought to throw considerable doubt on his speculation; and at first sight it does so. But a little reflection shows that the anomaly is not inexplicable, and that Laplace simply went too far in putting down as a certain result of nebular genesis, what is, in some instances, only a probable result. The cause he pointed out as determining the direction of rotation, is the greater <b>absolute</b> <b>velocity</b> of the outer part of the detached ring. But there are conditions under which this difference of velocity may be too insignificant, even if it exists. If a mass of nebulous matter approaching spirally to the central spheroid, and eventually joining it tangentially, is made up of parts having the same absolute velocities; then, after joining the equatorial periphery of the spheroid and being made to rotate with it, the angular velocity of its outer parts will be smaller than the angular velocity of its inner parts. Hence, if, when the angular velocities of the outer and inner parts of a detached ring are the same, there results a tendency to rotation in the same direction with the orbital motion, it may be inferred that when the outer parts of the ring have a smaller angular velocity than the inner parts, a tendency to retrograde rotation will be the consequence.|$|E

Unexpectedly, as first pointed out in Hudson et. al., Ap. j. (2011), even with EVE's spectral resolution of 0. 1 nm and 'irradiance' measurements, EVE {{has the ability to}} very accurately determine Doppler shifts in all emissions during solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

50|$|Other {{individual}} objects {{can have}} fundamental distance estimates made for them under special circumstances. If {{the expansion of}} a gas cloud, like a supernova remnant or planetary nebula, can be observed over time, then an expansion parallax distance to that cloud can be estimated. Those measurements however suffer from uncertainties in the deviation of the object from sphericity. Binary stars which are both visual and spectroscopic binaries also can have their distance estimated by similar means, and don't suffer from the above geometric uncertainty. The common characteristic to these methods is that a measurement of angular motion is combined with a measurement of the <b>absolute</b> <b>velocity</b> (usually obtained via the Doppler effect). The distance estimate comes from computing how far the object must be to make its observed <b>absolute</b> <b>velocity</b> appear with the observed angular motion.|$|E

Large seismic anisotropy of hydrated minerals is a primary cause of anisotropy in deformed rocks of subduction zones. In foliated serpentinites, the combination of intrinsic mineral anisotropy due to the layered structure of phyllosilicates and their strong alignment in deformed rocks due to the plate-shaped crystals results {{in a range of}} VP/VS ratio spanning most of that of typical subduction zone rocks (Bezacier, et al. 2010 a). Anisotropy of blueschists is also marked because of alignment of anisotropic amphiboles and epidotes (Bezacier, et al. 2010 b). <b>Absolute</b> <b>velocities</b> and VP/VS ratio are also drastically decreased by the presence of overpressurized fluids (Peacock, et al. 2011). Finally, in addition to modifying <b>absolute</b> <b>velocities</b> and VP/VS ratio, the presence of fluids or magmas damps seismic waves because of fluid motion in porosity and can be tracked by mapping seismic attenuation (Nakajima 2014).|$|R

Movement in aquatic organisms can also be strongly affected by abiotic {{factors such as}} the viscosity of the medium. We examined the effects of both biotic factors and abiotic factors on buccal pumping kinematics in Xenopus tadpoles using high-speed imaging of an ontogenetic series of tadpoles combined with experimental manipulation of the medium over a 10 -fold range of viscosity. We found influences of both biotic and abiotic factors on tadpole movements; <b>absolute</b> <b>velocities</b> and excursions of the jaws and hyoid were greater in higher viscosity fluid but durations of movements were unaffected. Smaller tadpoles have relatively wider heads and more robust hyoid muscles used in buccal expansion and compression. Lever arm ratios were found to be constant at all sizes; therefore, smaller tadpoles have relatively higher resolved muscle forces and, like tadpoles in more viscous medium, displayed higher <b>absolute</b> <b>velocities</b> of jaw and hyoid movements. Nonetheless, small tadpoles drew in water at lower Reynolds numbers (Re) than predicted by kinematics, due to negative allometry of the buccal pump.
