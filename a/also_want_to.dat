5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

25|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.|$|E
25|$|Especially used by fighters {{with strong}} wrestling {{background}} facing a highly skilled BJJ opponent, or by wrestlers who prefer stand-up fights. Usually fighters who adopt this strategy use takedowns only for scoring, easily allowing the adversary {{to stand up}} and continue the fight. They <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> land clear strikes and control the octagon. In order to win the fight by decision all score oriented fighters have to master perfect MMA defense techniques and avoid takedowns.|$|E

25|$|It {{also must}} {{double as a}} clean room to {{preserve}} the science value of the samples. The problem here is that, while it {{is relatively easy to}} simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remove parts of the sample and use them in experiments. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be contained to prevent contamination of Earth. However {{at the same time the}} samples would need to be kept free from contamination by Earth micro-organisms and biological material; even a single amino acid of Earth origin could confuse the analysis. This introduces conflicting requirements. They surely can be reconciled but to date, no facility has had to do this, so new building requirements would need to be imposed.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{city council}} {{approved}} converting one-way arteries {{through the city}} centre to allow for two-way traffic, {{to make it easier}} for people to make their way around the city to explore it. In terms of urban planning and use, two-way traffic improves circulation within the area. The city wanted to improve downtown as a destination, rather than a place to pass through. The council <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have downtown St. Catharines on the Wine Route, a driving tour of Niagara wineries and an Ontario Wine Council initiative to boost the number of visitors to the region's many wineries. The Wine Route was modified to officially redirect winery goers through the downtown starting in 2012. The first phase of two-way traffic was completed in 2009, with St. Paul and King streets being converted. The cost of the conversion was $3.5million and was shared with Niagara Region. In 2012, most observers concluded that the change had achieved its goals; it garnered national media attention.|$|E

More directly, the review notes that [...] "Bewick was aware that his role was to offer a modest guide to birds that the common man not only could afford but would <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> possess." [...] Bewick was not [...] "a scientist, {{but he was a}} perfectionist". The book's text was written by [...] "failed author" [...] Ralph Beilby, but the text is [...] "almost extraneous" [...] given Bewick's masterpiece.|$|E

500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
