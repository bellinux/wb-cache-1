This study is limited by the sole inclusion of clinical pharmacists, who were identified in our healthcare settings as the most likely care providers to encounter and document ADEs. It is possible that we might have uncovered other aspects of the ADE form requiring modifications had we been able to recruit more participants from other clinical backgrounds or settings, and anticipate further design adjustments as the use of the form is expanded. Also, our findings are susceptible to the Hawthorne effect, which occurs when participants are <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> objectives, potentially influencing their behavior.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{assess the}} value of {{detecting}} human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in false negative archival cervical smears in population based screening programmes for cervical cancer. METHODS [...] Cytomorphologically classified false negative archival Pap smears (n = 27) taken from 18 women up to six years before cervical cancer was diagnosed were blindly mixed with 89 smears from hospital patients {{with a variety of}} gynaecological complaints and tested for HPV by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Corresponding cervical cancer biopsy specimens were also available for HPV analysis. Neither the examining cytopathologist nor the molecular biologist was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> design. RESULTS [...] HPV DNA was detected in the smears of 16 patients with cervical cancer missed previously by cytology. HPV 16 and 18 were found predominantly in those smears taken up to six years before the diagnosis of cervical cancer. The smears of the two remaining patients were reclassified as inadequate for cytology or contained no suitable DNA for PCR. In 15 patients the same HPV type could be found in the smears and the cervical cancer biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results indicate that high risk HPV types can be detected in archival smears classified as false negative on cytology and that cytological screening errors may be reduced if combined with PCR testing for HPV...|$|E
40|$|Background: Advertising {{channels}} in today's marketplace {{are becoming more}} limited {{with the development of}} ad-free sources of entertainment. The phenomenon of product placements is therefore becoming {{one of the most important}} sources for advertising in media. Especially film productions have turned into a canvas for companies to display their brands upon. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the case of product placements in Hollywood blockbuster movies. In particular, brand recognition and audience's ac-ceptance of a brand’s presence in movies were examined. Method: A mixed method approach was applied in order to fulfill the purpose of this thesis and answer research questions. A questionnaire in the form of a handout and focus group discussions were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data from audiences consisting of international students. The questionnaires were handed out after the movies had been shown in a setting resembling that of a movie theater, meaning that respondents were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> beforehand and were therefore not biased. The focus group discussions gave us information needed in answering the second research question and getting more insights of the practice. Conclusions: Our research showed that product placements in movies lead to brand recognition, and audience’s acceptance of a brand’s presence is influenced by congru-ency of product placement in movies. This outcome resulted from the combination of four determining factors: movie genre, execution factors, appropriateness in the movie setting and brand characteristics...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact of {{behavioral}} interventions and nudging in dealing with the food waste problem. In particular, the authors implement an information campaign aiming to increase consumers’ awareness of the food waste problem. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In the period of three weeks, the authors observe intentions to prevent food waste and actual food waste of the consumers in a university restaurant serving ready meals. During the intervention period, consumers are exposed to an information campaign, designed to avoid consumers’ insufficient planning problem. FINDINGS: Consumers are willing to pay the same price for less food more often during the campaign than before the campaign, but the approximated impact on the food waste is not significant. Social emotions of guilt and shame are linked to consumers’ intentions to prevent food waste, suggesting channels to be included in a successful information campaign nudging consumers toward food waste reduction. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The authors were not able to measure precisely food waste, but observed consumers in a real-life context. Consumers were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> and made daily purchase decisions before and after the information campaign. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: Consumer behavior is at the core of the food waste problem in developed countries. It is important to understand how consumers can be nudged at low cost, using an information campaign, to change their attitude to food waste, and to decrease food waste. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The authors collected an original dataset on the impact of an information campaign, observing behavior of consumers in a real-life context...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims : Pre-operative {{investigations}} are performed before any surgical intervention under anaesthesia. Many are considered as routine. However, {{there are no}} clear guidelines regarding these in India. We aim {{to look at the}} relevance of the laboratory investigations ordered routinely and their cost implications compared with the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Methods: This prospective study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 163 patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures were included in this study. Neither the surgeons nor anaesthesiologists involved in the case were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> The laboratory investigations of the patients who underwent surgery were noted. All values were categorised as normal or abnormal and they were assessed as indicated or unindicated based on NICE guidelines. Results: One hundred and sixty-three patients were subjected to a total of 984 tests. Forty three patients (26 %) were subjected to tests as per NICE guidelines. Of the 984 tests, 515 tests were unindicated (52 %). Out of the 515 unindicated tests, 7 (1. 3 %) were abnormal. None of these seven tests required any intervention or change of anaesthetic plan. The most common unindicated tests done were cardiac echocardiography and chest X-ray (92. 5 % and 93 % respectively). The additional cost incurred towards unindicated tests was 63 % of the total cost for the tests. Conclusion: Pre-operative laboratory investigations add to cost significantly. Patient premorbid conditions and surgical grade should guide the clinician to request for the relevant laboratory tests...|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dialysis}} catheter, each patient had a central venous catheter, {{which is not}} adjacent to the thermistor-tipped thermodilution catheter to avoid the cross-talk phenomenon [22]. Single TPTD measurements were obtained by central venous injection of 20 ml of 'iced' (< 8 °C) normal 0.9 % saline and carried out by ICU nurses who were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> purpose. In each patient, a set (three injections) of thermodilution determinations was performed within 2 h before and a set within 2 h after SLEDD, in the same body position. In case of CVVH, thermodilution measurements were performed {{in the morning and}} in the evening with an interval of 12 h. For each set of thermodilution determinations, the calculated mean values of the determinations were used for haemodynamic management and statistical analysis. The cardiac output (CO) was determined by TPTD using the Stewart-Hamilton method [23, 24]. Calculations were carried out with the following equations using a computer system (PiCCOplus, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) [24]. The intrathoracic thermal volume (ITTV) and pulmonary thermal volume (PTV) were respectively calculated from the mean transit time (MTt), and the exponential downslope time (DSt) of the thermodilution curve: ITTV = CO × MTt and PTV = CO × DSt. Theoretically, ITTV consists of the PTV and the sum of the end-diastolic volumes of all cardiac chambers. Accordingly, global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) was calculated as follows: GEDV = ITTV − PTV. Based on a linear relation between GEDV and intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), ITBV = 1.25 × GEDV. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) is the difference between ITTV and ITBV. Absolute values for GEDV and EVLW were normalised as indexed by body surface area (GEDVI) and body weight (EVLWI). The difference between GEDVI before and after dialysis was called ΔGEDVI (ΔGEDVI = GEDVIpost − GEDVIpre). Accordingly, ΔEVLWI = EVLWIpost − EVLWIpre.|$|E

Recent studies showed that 30 % of men with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) would develop prostate cancer (CaP) within 1 year after repeated biopsy. This prompted us to do a proof-of-principle clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of GTCs for the chemoprevention of Cap in HG-PIN volunteers. The purity and content of GTCs preparations were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography [(-) -epigallocathechin, 5. 5 %; (-) -epicatechin, 12. 24 %; (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate, 51. 88 %; (-) -epicatechin- 3 -gallate, 6. 12 %; total GTCs, 75. 7 %; caffeine, < 1 %]. Sixty volunteers with HG-PIN, who were made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> details, agreed to sign an informed consent form and were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Daily treatment consisted of three GTCs capsules, 200 mg each (total 600 mg/d). After 1 year, only one tumor was diagnosed among the 30 GTCs-treated men (incidence, similar to 3 %), whereas nine cancers were found among the 30 placebo-treated men (incidence, 30 %). Total prostate-specific antigen did not change significantly between the two arms, but GTCs-treated men showed values constantly lower with respect to placebo-treated ones. International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life scores of GTCs-treated men with coexistent benign prostate hyperplasia improved, reaching statistical significance in the case of International Prostate Symptom Scores. No significant side effects or adverse effects were documented. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that GTCs are safe and very effective for treating premalignant lesions before Cap develops. As a secondary observation, administration of GTCs also reduced lower urinary tract symptoms, suggesting that these compounds might also be of help for treating the symptoms of benign prostate hyperplasia...|$|E

The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perception-altering effects <b>of</b> narcosis, a diver may not be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symptoms, but <b>studies</b> have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless.|$|R
40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{cross sectional}} study {{was carried out}} in Mkuranga District, Coast Region during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> June 2004. <b>The</b> main objective <b>of</b> {{this study was to determine}} factors associated with non- compliance to anti-Lymphatic filariasis drugs, which are given en-mass annually in a single dose. A structured questionnaire was administered to 251 <b>study</b> participants in <b>the</b> District. In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 participants of whom 22 were village LF committee members, 3 community members with late manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease (elephantiasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower limbs), 2 women in the community and 3 youth from the general population. It was found that 79 %(200 / 251) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> Lymphatic filariasis disease in their area. Only 23 %(46 / 200) of respondents knew that the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes. There was however, inadequate awareness of LF elimination programme's existence with only 29 %(74 / 251) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents being <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> programme. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> found that <b>the</b> drugs given were generally safe, minor side effects were experienced by only 7. 5 %(12 / 161) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents, which included slight nausea prompting no need for medical attention. Fear of drug side effects was found to account for only 5. 2 %(13 / 251) of respondent's reasons for non compliance. Drug compliance was found to be 64 %(161 / 251) in Mkuranga District. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> identified factors such as mistrust of drug distributors, absenteeism and inadequate health education as the main contributors to the observed non-compliance. In conclusion <b>the</b> <b>study</b> shows that proper health education on LF disease, causes, signs and symptoms, and prevention is vital and needs to be strengthened. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> recommends <b>the</b> programme to put more efforts at ensuring health education is properly conducted using all the available means and active population involvement in selection of drug distributors...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study {{based on interviews}} with teachers, social workers and school counselors – with aim to analyze how norm critical social work is in schools. Gender and sexuality norms are in focus which is analyzed in a intersectional and queer theoretical perspective. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> shows that what is defined as a norm in the society varies both socially, historically and culturally. School is a reflection of its society and therefore also reflects its norms, such as heteronormativity and gender roles. <b>The</b> making <b>of</b> norms also makes it possible to categorize people, often by using stereotypes. As a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society, we’re a part of several different categories – e g depending of gender, sexuality, class and ethnicity. This categorizing is affecting our conditions, but also other people expectations and views of each other. To generalize and to use stereotypes is making the complex easy – {{but at the same time}} it’s power structures that maintain inequality and oppression if you’re not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> shows how this is transferred into schools and how teachers and other school professions design their work to be more critical and <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> norms and power structures...|$|R
