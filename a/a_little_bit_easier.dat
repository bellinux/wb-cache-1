In an interview on Shade 45 Radio in March 2016, he explained that [...] "it's been my dream to act since I was in like eighth grade. I {{always wanted to be}} an actor.

Maybe I'll change my mind but I don't know what I would have done differently or could have done differently. There's always something you can do better. But not knowing what that might be at this moment makes it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easier</b> to digest." ...|$|E
50|$|When Ken confronts Sarah {{about her}} binge drinking, she confesses that she drinks because the alcohol makes life <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easier.</b> As the film progresses, Sarah {{endeavours}} {{to be regarded}} as mature. Her Donald Duck hat, however, belies her attempts. She dons the hat when she babysits for the Tylers. When she does so, Ken (whom Sarah has invited along) gently rebuffs her when she tells him that she loves him. To make matters worse, Sarah is unable to contact with her father when she attempts to do so by telephone. Sarah drinks when she is supposed to be babysitting and then passes out. When her mother discovers what Sarah has been up to, her only concern is that Sarah will be the focus of neighbourhood gossip. In a confrontation with Matt and JoAnne, Sarah states that she has been drinking almost everyday for two years.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Andrade sealed his {{transfer}} to Cumberlands Patriots in the United States. He played two seasons {{for the team}} in 35 matches and scored 27 goals and couple assists. His first season was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easy</b> {{because he had a}} Brazilian teammate, [...] who helped him with his adaptation. Playing as an attacking mid, he was the second top-scorer in the team with 9 goals and had the most assists with 9. He helped the team reach the semi-finals of the Mid-South Conference. In his second season, with the change in the head coach, Andrade played as a right winger. He scored high-top 18 goals in 17 games and had 5 assists during the season. He was selected MVP of the year for his team and First-Team All-Conference. With {{the end of the season}} and a great performance, he received different offers from different clubs in the US. After analyzing all the offers with his agent, he decided to {{transfer to}} the Queens Royals.|$|R
5000|$|Kazzia had a twelve-week break {{before the}} Yorkshire Oaks which was run on much firmer ground. Her unbeaten run {{came to an}} end as she proved no match for Islington and faded into fourth place. Kazzia's {{connections}} felt that she may have been under-prepared for the race. Crisford expressed the view that they had [...] "been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too <b>easy</b> with her", while Richard Edmondson, writing in the Independent described her as looking [...] "soft as putty".|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 Turk {{left the}} band and Skatt started playing rhythm guitar, the group {{relocated}} to Melbourne and became The Mad Turks. Jenkins described {{the basis for the}} change, [...] "The problem was ... you could live off the dole as a musician really easily in Adelaide, so there was plenty of money for recreational vices. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too <b>easy.</b> When I got to Melbourne, {{it was time to get}} it together". There they released their second album, Toast (1990, Greasy Pop). In early 1990, La Merde was replaced on bass guitar by Phil Magnay from Perth band The Jackals. Toast spawned three singles, [...] "Tempers Flare" [...] (May 1989), [...] "The Last Time" [...] (November) and [...] "Walking Disaster" [...] (March 1990). In late 1991 management problems, poor promotion by Festival and low attendances at gigs resulted in the group disbanding. In 1992 Skatt and Benedictine (now as Larizza) went on to form Icecream Hands (initially as Chuck Skatt and His Icecream Hands).|$|R
5000|$|After {{capturing}} {{the two world}} championships it competed in, Mercedes withdrew from motorsport {{at the end of}} the 1955 season. Despite its strong reliability and good track performance, drivers Fangio and Moss described the car in MotorSport magazine as being [...] "a bit difficult to drive, with a tendency for snap oversteer". Moss also later said that [...] "I'm surprised that the Merc wasn't <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easier</b> to drive, because it wasn't. It was a driver's car, but not an easy car to drive." [...] Fangio shared similar feelings, also saying in MotorSport Magazine in 1979 that the car was [...] "not so nice to drive as a Maserati 250F, but you were almost sure to finish. So the Mercedes was incredible in that way." [...] 1970s/80s Formula One driver John Watson drove the W196 at Hockenheim, providing some insight as to why the car was difficult to drive. He said that [...] "if you gave this car wider and grippier tyres and altered the suspension to suit, then the handling would be of a very high order indeed." [...] The W196 was so advanced and ahead of its time, that the narrow tyres available at the time simply could not fully handle the car's exceptional performance.|$|E
50|$|Ally {{enters the}} book while Sammy is at Central Medical in the Sight Loss Department, filing for {{dysfunctional}} benefits. In simple terms, Ally is a lawyer; however, {{he refers to}} himself as ‘representation’ for Sammy. Ally offers to help Sammy file his complaint about dysfunctional benefits, believing {{he has a good}} chance of winning and making his life <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easier.</b> This character challenges Sammy’s character with his kindness and purity of heart. From their meeting, Ally only offers to help Sammy and improve his quality of life—something Sammy does not do for himself or others. He also promises that he will take no money unless Sammy himself wins money, showing just how deep his kindness is. Ally is a married man, with a family to care for, but he still keeps himself involved in the lives of his clients. Ally approaches Sammy to help him multiple times and even offers to meet him whenever is most convenient for Sammy. As a person, Ally comes across as a caring, honest, respectable guy, and his character only comes into question once during the story when Sammy’s son tells Sammy he thought Ally was a cop when he talked to him on the phone. Even though suspicions about Ally arise in the end, he offers a good contrast to Sammy’s selfish tendencies throughout the book.|$|E

She replied: [...] Before I did what I did, we didn't have a place in rock 'n' roll. Not really. You had your Grace Slicks and all that, but that's not what I did. I was the first to be taken seriously as a female rock 'n' roll musician and singer. That hadn't been done before. I played the boys at their own game. For everybody that came afterward, it was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easier,</b> which is good. I'm proud of that. If I have a legacy, that's what it is. It's nothing I take lightly. It was gonna happen sooner or later. In 2014, I will have done my job 50 years. It was gonna be done by somebody, and I think it fell to me to do because I don't look at gender. I never have. It doesn't occur to me if a 6-foot-tall guy has pissed me off not to square up to him. That's just the way I am. If I wanted to play a bass solo, {{it never occurred to me}} that I couldn't. When I saw Elvis for the first time when I was 5, I decided I wanted to be him, and it didn't occur to me that he was a guy. That's why it had to fall to somebody like me.|$|E

By having the individual on the ground directly across from the restart box, they can really get a good understanding and allow us to feel 100 percent that we stamped it with a very good decision.” Richard Buck, Sprint Cup managing director speaking to reporters after the race. The race restarted with 58 laps to go. NASCAR decided to review the restart and black-flagged Brad Keselowski for a restart violation. He was forced to serve a drive-through penalty. After the race, he said that he [...] "got the chance to do something again for the first time.

In addition to editing, the extension must also ensure proper communication with Microsoft SQL database server as well as with Team Foundation Server. In this thesis we present Visual Studio 2010 as a development tool and the various options for extending it.

It allows us to produce richer and visually appealing applications that the extension will take advantage of.

30|$|The {{national}} debate on youth unemployment in Italy is fortunately overcoming {{some of the}} refrains of the past, which had become like blind spots. The emphasis on labor market flexibility {{is perhaps the most}} important. The recent reform of the labor market, so-called Fornero Act (Law 92 / 2012) from the name of the Minister of Labor who proposed it, Elsa Fornero, {{has been one of the}} last attempts to further flexibilize the Italian labor market, although in the name of flexicurity 4. On the one hand, it has made temporary work more costly and, on the other hand, it has made permanent work cheaper by reducing the constraints on firing decisions based on article 18 of the 1970 Labor Code. On the one hand, entrepreneurs have been obliged to declare the reason for the temporary nature of the contract and to pay higher social security contributions to temporary workers than to permanent workers. On the other hand, firing decisions have become <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>easier.</b> The Fornero Law has had only a limited impact on employment, despite the great expectations. In fact, by making temporary work more difficult to renew, over 200, 000 temporary contract jobs have been immediately discontinued, which also could be attributable to the on-going economic crisis (Boeri 2013).|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{predicted}} to lead to mass displacement, since the land where millions of people currently live will be, at some point, covered with water.

As {{the negative impact of}} climate change becomes clearer and closer in time, policy solutions to this problem are discussed. In this paper, I look at previous cases of populations’ displacement to identify policy lessons that may be applicable to climate-driven displacement. I thus present four case—involving populations in China, Kosovo, New Orleans and the island of Bikini, and determine the lessons that can be learned, how they {{can be applied to the}} inevitable displacement looming in the Pacific Ocean, and suggest policy recommendations.
