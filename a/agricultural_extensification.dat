40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{agreement}} of about 50 % reduction in pesticide uses according to the accords du “Grenelle de l’environnement” in France, the central part of this study involves the assessment of agricultural intensification (AI) and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> (AE) processes in crop activities. This is done with reference to pesticide uses per ha thereby helping to proffer a solution to the lingering questions of farmers as regards the use of inputs in an intensified manner or otherwise. With respect to this, a sample of 600 farms in the Meuse department was observed over a 12 -year period. The analysis was essentially to assess cost efficiency dominance between the two technologies AE and AI using non parametric cost-functions which involves different characterizations of the reference set. This therefore helps to define the relative intensive and extensive technologies in terms of pesticide uses per ha, our empirical application therefore shows that AE process is a better option than AI not only for the society but also for the producers who could significantly reduce their operating costs. agricultural intensification (AI), <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> (AE), pesticide reduction, environmental performance, non parametric cost-functions, Environmental Economics and Policy, Farm Management,...|$|E

This paper discusses prospective utilization of ex-mining land for <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification.</b> Mining area equipped with a business license for mining in Indonesia is around 2. 2 million ha under Coal Concession Agreement, and 2. 9 million ha under the Contract of Effort. A part of land is already finished being mined, and be managed properly in order to benefit the community and not damage the environment. The initial steps that need to be done is mapping of mined lands, included a status of ownership (land tenure), so that subsequent use of both for agriculture and other businesses can be sustainable. Land reclamation is necessary to increase capacity and efficiency for biomass production. Determination of land use types, should be based on land tenure, bio-physical conditions of land, and the needs of the community or local government. In the future, mining land management requirements is not enough simply by opening a feasibility study for mining operations, but need to be accompanied also with itsclosure plan (planning of closures), which includes environmental protection and mitigation of socio-economic problems.

A distribution model of 3 indicator species taxa (butterflies, spiders, and carabid beetles) is related to influencing factors by means of multivariate statistics (CCA, partial CCA). Hypothetical influencing factors are categorised as follows: (1) habitat (habitat type, management techniques) and (2) landscape (habitat heterogeneity, variability, diversity, proportion of natural and semi-natural areas). The correlation models developed for spider, carabid beetle and butterfly assemblages revealed that there are no general rules relating species diversity to habitat and landscape features. The relationship strongly depends on the organism and on the region under study. Therefore, biodiversity response to landscape and habitat changes has to be identified by means of a multi-indicator concept in different landscape situations...|$|R

A post-conflict context would open up the possibility of modernizing agriculture, improving living standards in rural areas and making good use of the vast natural resources. Sustainable bioenergy combined with improved land use strategies is of particular interest in this context. However, while bioenergy is today the second largest renewable resource after hydropower, no official plans exist for exploiting it in a post-conflict context. Our study investigates the impacts that an accelerated deployment of bioenergy could have in Colombia until 2030, under different land use pathways. Firstly, we review the country's socioeconomic, land use, energy and emissions context. Then, we identify lessons that Colombia could learn from Brazil to accomplish the proposed targets. Secondly, we explore various scenarios deploying different technologies (bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, biomethane and biomass-based power generation & CHP) and land use pathways that are likely to be implemented in a post-conflict scenario (zero deforestation, <b>agricultural</b> intensification and <b>extensification).</b> Thirdly, we analyze variations in energy demand and supply, greenhouse gas emissions, land use change and biofuel trade. We find that biomethane and biomass-based power generation & CHP could reduce emissions more effectively than first-generation biofuels. However, their abatement is only 5 % relative to a baseline scenario. Combining all bioenergy technologies with zero deforestation, <b>agricultural</b> intensification and <b>extensification</b> could boost abatements up to 280 %, a value four times higher than the national commitments by 2030. Our study shows that relatively simpler land use and energy models using free software can produce results of quality comparable to more complex and widely accepted models (e. g. IAMs). These results might be helpful to policymakers evaluating the role of bioenergy in a post-conflict context and to other developing countries with significant bioenergy potential and similar conditions...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the impacts}} of <b>agricultural</b> {{intensification}} and <b>extensification</b> on soil biota communities is useful {{in order to preserve}} and restore biological diversity in agricultural soils and enhance the role of soil biota in agroecosystem functioning. Over four consecutive years, we investigated the effects of <b>agricultural</b> intensification and <b>extensification</b> (including conversion of grassland to arable land and vice versa, increased and decreased levels of mineral fertilization, and monoculture compared to crop rotation) on major soil biota group abundances and functional diversity. We integrated and compared effects across taxonomic levels to identify sensitive species groups. Conversion of grassland to arable land negatively affected both abundances and functional diversity of soil biota. Further intensification of the cropping system by increased fertilization and reduced crop diversity exerted smaller and differential effects on different soil biota groups. Agricultural intensification affected abundances of taxonomic groups with larger body size (earthworms, enchytraeids, microarthropods, and nematodes) more negatively than smaller-sized taxonomic groups (protozoans, bacteria, and fungi). Also functional group diversity and composition were more negatively affected in larger-sized soil biota (earthworms, predatory mites) than in smaller-sized soil biota (nematodes). Furthermore, larger soil biota appeared to be primarily affected by short-term consequences of conversion (disturbance, loss of habitat), whereas smaller soil biota were predominantly affected by long-term consequences (probably loss of organic matter). Reestablishment of grassland resulted in increased abundances of soil biota groups, but since not all groups increased in the same measure, the community structure was not completely restored. We concluded that larger-sized soil biota are more sensitive to agricultural intensification than smaller-sized soil biota. Furthermore, since larger-sized soil biota groups had lower taxonomic richness, we suggest that agricultural intensification exerts strongest effects on species-poor soil biota groups, thus supporting the hypothesis that biodiversity has an “insurance” function. As soil biota {{play an important role in}} agroecosystem functioning, altered soil biota abundances and functional group composition under agricultural intensification are likely to affect the functioning of the agroecosyste...|$|R

For this purpose, the empirical evidences are drawn from FAO statistics with reference to Southeast Asian Countries. The paper attempted to provide both a regional and comparative perspective in understanding the relationship between population growth and land use changes. The study observed a steady growth in the human population during the last three decades, though the growth rate has declined during the nineties. The unequal distribution of population in terms of its size and growth was observed among the Southeast Asian Countries. The analysis indicated changes in land use pattern towards ‘arable and permanent cropland’ and ‘land not available for cultivation’. However, such a trend varied across Southeast Asian Countries significantly. The effect of population pressure on land use changes are examined both in a broad and narrow sense, which indicated growing population pressure on land, particularly on <b>agricultural</b> land resulting <b>extensification.</b> It is observed that extensification is made possible by shifting land from forest and pastureland, and also by shifting from ‘land not available for cultivation.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that soil fungal biomass {{increases}} towards more natural, mature systems. Shifts to a fungal-based soil food web have previously been observed with abandonment of <b>agricultural</b> fields and <b>extensification</b> of agriculture. In a previous field experiment we found increased fungal biomass with reduced N fertilisation. Here, we explore relationships between fungi, bacteria, N input and grassland age on real dairy farms in the Netherlands. We hypothesised that also in pastures that are still in production there is a negative relationship between fungal biomass and fertilisation, and that fungal biomass increases with grassland age in pastures that are still in production. We expected the fungal/bacterial biomass ratio to show the same responses, as this ratio has often been used as an indicator for management changes. We sampled 48 pastures from eight organic dairy farms. Sites differed in age and fertilisation rate. We determined fungal and bacterial biomass, as well as ergosterol (a fungal biomarker). Fungal and bacterial biomass and ergosterol, showed a negative relationship with N application rate, and correlated positively with organic matter percentage. In old pastures, fungal biomass and ergosterol were higher than in younger pastures. Because bacterial biomass responded {{in the same way as}} fungal biomass, the F/B ratio remained constant, and can therefore¿in our data set¿not be used as an indicator for changing management. We conclude that the changes in fungal and bacterial biomass were driven by changes in organic matter quality and quantity. The negative relationship we found between N application rate and fungal biomass adds to earlier work and confirms the presence of this relationship in pastures with relatively small differences in management intensities. Earlier studies on shifts in fungal biomass focused on ex-agricultural fields or restoration projects. Here we show that fungal biomass is also higher in older agricultural pastures...|$|R

Understanding the effects these pressures may have {{is necessary to}} designing land management strategies that ensure food security, ecosystem service provision and successful climate mitigation and adaptation.

Nevertheless, the recent development of integrated modelling frameworks allows for {{the exploration of the}} co-development of human and natural systems under scenarios of global change, potentially illuminating the main drivers and processes in future land system change. Here, we use one such integrated modelling framework (the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform) to investigate the range of projected outcomes in the European land system across climatic and socio-economic scenarios for the 2050 s. We find substantial consistency in locations and types of change even under the most divergent conditions, with results suggesting that climate change alone will lead to a contraction in the agricultural and forest area within Europe, particularly in southern Europe. This is partly offset by the introduction of socioeconomic changes that change both the demand for agricultural production, through changing food demand and net imports, and the efficiency of <b>agricultural</b> production.

The research is applying qualitative approach with the use of case study and socio-historical strategy to learn how much the indigenous rural social institutional system is able to guarantee the community livelihood system? To learn this subject, the research has conducted in Kasepuhan Sinar Resmi (Sukabumi) and Dusun Sumurjaya (Subang). The research it self is applying perspective of Mazhab Bogor which sees the rural community livelihood system character in four aspects: livelihood source, livelihood strategy, economic institution and social security guarantee system in rural community. Based on these four aspects, the village with strong indigenous social institution is posses the livelihood system dominantly in agriculture and natural resource extraction, chosen livelihood strategy is more into multiple livelihoods in the form of multiple actors/straddling strategy, economic institution system is based on the collectivity to fulfill their food subsistence requirements. Their social security guarantee system is depends on social bonds like the patron-client pattern and communal activities.

Variation exists in which MODIS datasets are used, how they are processed for analysis, and what ground reference data are used. Moreover, various and-use/land-cover classes are ultimately resolved, and as yet, crop-specific classifications (e. g. soy?corn vs. soy?cotton double crop) have not been reported in the literature, favoring instead generalized classes such as single vs. double crop. The objective {{of this study is to}} present a rigorous multiyear evaluation of the applicability of time-series MODIS 250 -m VI data for crop classification in Mato Grosso, Brazil. This study shows progress toward more refined crop-specific classification, but some grouping of crop classes remains necessary. It employs a farm field polygon-based ground reference dataset that is unprecedented in spatial and temporal coverage for the state, consisting of 2003 annual field site samples representing 415 unique field sites and five crop years (2005 - 2009). This allows for creation of a dataset containing "best-case" or "pure" pixels, which we used to test class separability in a multiyear cross validation framework applied to boosted decision tree classifiers trained on MODIS data subjected to different pre-processing treatments. Reflecting the agricultural landscape of Mato Grosso as a whole, cropping practices represented in the ground reference dataset largely involved soybeans, and soy-based classes (primarily double crop "soy-commercial" and single crop "soy-cover") dominated the analysis along with cotton and pasture. With respect to the MODIS data treatments, the best results were obtained using date-ofacquisition interpolation of the 16 -day composite VI time series and outlier point screening, for which five-year out-of-sample accuracies were consistently near or above 80 % and Kappa values were above 0. 60.

40|$|Growing {{awareness}} of widespread hunger and poverty {{in many countries}} in the SSA is spurring a focus on productivity increase in smallholder farming systems. The rationale is that with current production systems many SSA countries are not keeping pace with population growth and changing of peoples’ lifestyles. To respond to this challenge the Government of Mozambique developed its Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PEDSA) aiming to improve agricultural productivity {{of the majority of}} smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Smallholder farmers are diverse in terms of resources and aspirations. The main objectives of this study are first to understand the diversity among maize-based smallholder farms and their current constraints in improving agricultural productivity in the Manica Plateau, Central Mozambique, and second, building on that understanding to explore options for biomass production either for food, cash or biofuel at farm level and contributions to maize availability in the region. The study was conducted in the Dombe and Zembe Administrative Posts. Farmers in the two posts cultivate both food and cash crops using the same resources, however, distances to the urban market differ, with Zembe close and Dombe far away from the markets. In addition, the agroecological conditions for crop production are more favourable in Dombe compared with Zembe. Using farm surveys, direct observations and on-farm measurements, followed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) I identified land and labour as the variables that can best explain the variability found among smallholder farms (Chapter 2). Based on these variables I categorised farms into four Farm Types (FT) : FT 1. Large farms (4. 4 ha in Dombe and 2. 2 ha in Zembe), hiring in labour; FT 2. Intermediate sized farms (1. 9 - 1. 2 ha), hiring in and out labour; FT 3 a. Small farms (1. 1 - 0. 9 ha), sharing labour; and FT 3 b. Small farms (1. 0 - 0. 7 ha), hiring out labour. The maize yield and maize labour productivities were higher on large farms (2. 3 t ha- 1 in Dombe and 2. 0 t ha- 1 in Zembe; 2. 5 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Dombe and 2. 6 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Zembe) compared with small farms (1. 5 t ha- 1 in Dombe and 1. 1 t ha- 1 in Zembe; 1. 4 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Dombe and 0. 9 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Zembe). The hiring in labour from small farms allowed large farms to timely weed their fields. Small farms were resource constrained and hired out labour (mutrakita) for cash or food to the detriment of weeding their own fields, resulting in poor crop yields. Excessive alcohol consumption by small farms also raised concerns on labour quality. Chapter 3 explored options aiming at addressing farmers’ objectives of being maize self-sufficient and increased gross margin and the contribution to national objective of producing food. A bio-economic farm model was used to investigate two pathways to increase <b>agricultural</b> production: (i) <b>extensification,</b> expanding the current cultivated area; and (ii) intensification, increasing input use and output per unit of land. In the extensification pathway I considered the use of animal traction, herbicides and cultivators to save labour, whereas in the intensification pathway I explored the use improved varieties of maize, sesame, sunflower, pigeonpea and fertilizers. I focused on the large farms and the small farms hiring out labour as they represent both sides of the spectrum. The simulated results showed that combining labour and labour saving technologies substantially increased both gross margin and maize yields of large and small farms in both posts. Minor trade-offs is observed on large farms between the two goals whereas for small farms we see synergies between the goals. We concluded that prospects for increasing gross margin and food production are much better for large farms in Dombe compared with other farms. In Dombe, the maximum gross margin of large farms was 7530 $ y- 1 per farm and maximum maize sales of 30. 4 t y- 1 per farm. In Zembe, the maximum gross margin of large farms (2410 $ y- 1 per farm) and maximum maize sales (9. 5 t y- 1 per farm) were comparable to small farms in Dombe. I further assessed the impact of two biofuel investments (jatropha plantation and sunflower outgrower schemes) on farm level food security (food availability, access to food, stability of food, utilization of food). The results showed positive impact on small farms from employment on a jatropha plantation by increasing access to food and no impacts on intermediate and large farms. Impacts on food security from the sunﬂower outgrower scheme were minor which may be explained by the poor yields. The need to link smallholder farmers to markets has been increasingly recognized as important strategy to promote rural development and poverty reduction. I developed an analytical framework, the Windmill Approach that looked at decision making at farm level to grow certain crops and at transaction strategies (Chapter 5). Through this framework I showed that a farmer decision to participate in a particular (new) value chain is determined by (a) the suitability of the new crop in the farm system (including the adaptability of the current farm system), and (b) the farmer’s experience with selling in various value chains. This has major policy implications as it highlights that to support smallholder farmers access to markets a holistic approach is needed that combines farming systems analysis and transaction cost theory. In order to explore the opportunities for smallholder development there is need to understand the diversity of farms and farmers’ social and economic context. For large farms, in Central Mozambique farms with on average 2 - 4 ha of land, opportunities to improve their livelihoods through crop production can follow two pathways: intensification and extensification. Smallholders continue to produce staple food crops even when working on a plantation or participating in outgrower schemes. For small farms, off-farm opportunities such as those in a biofuel plantation are the best options to improve their livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|The Ecuadorian Amazon, {{lying in}} the {{headwaters}} of the Napo and Aguarico River valleys, is experiencing rapid change in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) conditions and regional landscape diversity uniquely tied to the spontaneous agricultural colonization of the Oriente region of northeastern Ecuador beginning in the mid to late 1970 s. Spontaneous colonization occurred on squattered lands located adjacent to oil company roads and in government development sectors composed of multiple 50 ha land parcels organized into ‘piano key’ shaped family farms or fincas. Portions of these fincas were deforested for <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> depending upon the age of the finca and several site and situation factors.

Focusing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of deforestation, <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification,</b> and plant succession at the finca-level, and urbanization at the community-level, a cell-based morphogenetic model of Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) was developed as the foundation for a predictive model of regional LULCC dynamics and landscape diversity. Here, LULC characteristics are determined using a time-series of remotely sensed data (i. e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Multispectral Scanner (MSS)) using an experimental [semitraditional] (hybrid unsupervised-supervised) classification scheme resulting in a time-series data set including LULC images for 1973, 1986, 1989, 1996, and 1999. Pixel histories of LULC type across the time-series were integrated into LULC trajectories and converted into seed or input data sets for LULC modeling to alternate time periods and for model validation. LULC simulations, achieved through cellular automata (CA) methodologies, were run on an annual basis to the year 2010 using 1973 as the initial conditions and the satellite time-series as the ‘check points’ in the simulations. The model was developed using the Imagine Spatial Modeler of the ERDAS image processing software, and enhanced using the Spatial Modeler Language (SML). The model works by (a) simulating the present by extrapolating from the past using the image time-series, (b) validating the simulations via the remotely sensed time-series of past conditions and through field observations of current conditions, (c) allowing the model to iterate to the year 2010, and (d) comparing model outputs to an autoregressive time-series approach for annual conditions that are compared via paired t-tests of pattern metrics run at the landscape-level to define compositional and structural differences between successive model outputs...|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{biological}} control aims {{to enhance the}} efficacy of arthropod {{biological control}} agents, such as parasitoids, partly by providing them with access to floral nectar. However, the suitability of a flower species for providing nectar to a parasitoid {{is dependent on the}} morphologies of the parasitoid and the flower, {{as well as on the}} quality of the nectar. The effects of seven flower species on the longevity of Microctonus hyperodae (Hymenoptera Braconidae), a parasitoid of the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were measured in the laboratory. The flowers were phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), alyssum (Lobularia maritima), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), white clover (Trifolium repens), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white mustard (Sinapis alba). The results suggested M. hyperodae was unable to reach nectar of red clover, white clover, alyssum and phacelia, but was able to gain access to the nectar of the other three species. However, only buckwheat and coriander increased its longevity. Flower corolla aperture and depth probably determined the parasitoid’s access to nectar. Accessible nectars were analyzed for sugar composition and the effect of the sucrose/(glucose + fructose) ratio on nectar suitability was assessed. The relevance of these results to other hymenopteran parasitoid species is discussed in terms of selecting the most appropriate floral diversity in <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> programmes. ...|$|E

The {{goal was to}} combine such data with expert knowledge, a set of analytic results, and dynamic modeling approaches to describe, explain, and explore the causes and consequences of land use and cover change (LUCC) in the northern Oriente region of the Ecuadorian Amazon. First, a cellular automaton (CA) model representing LUCC was developed using a time series of remotely sensed Landsat TM images for a 90 000 -ha intensive study area within the region and calibrated using alternative images from the time series. The classified images were linked to spatially referenced biophysical and socioeconomic coverages used as input data, and then combined with `rules ' derived from empirical analyses. Second, the CA model was used in dynamic simulations to explore LUCC as both causes and consequences of (a) road development, (b) <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> and land abandonment, (c) major shifts in world markets and crop prices, and (d) urban expansion of the central city within the region.

40|$|Agricultural {{dynamics}} in Brazil {{continue to be}} characterized by two sharply contrasting forms. On one hand, low-efficiency production and natural resource extraction systems remain widely practiced along Brazil?s agricultural frontier. On the other hand, one also finds an agriculture characterized by the adoption of high-tech practices {{and high levels of}} productivity that raise Brazil?s competitiveness in international commodity markets. Such contrasts have long raised questions about the sustainability of Brazil?s agricultural production, and they have led to conflicts among some public policies promoted by various federal government agencies. This project mapped agricultural land use, between 2005 - 2009, in the center of Mato Grosso?s grain production zone in order to compare the dynamics of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> vs. intensification of production. The analysis was based on the spectral profiles of vegetation index time-series data from MODIS, which allowed for identifying and mapping areas used for single and double-cropping of grains. The results show that the area of single-cropping was practically stable during the study period, while the area of double-cropping grew from being 20 % of the single-cropping area in 2005 to more than 50 % in 2009. These results make evident the need {{for the federal government to}} reconcile conflicting conservationist and developmentalist public policies in governing Brazilian agribusiness, for if it does not, the high and well recognized productive potential of Brazilian agriculture may be compromised. 201...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} general {{circulation}} model (GCM) experiments {{have shown that}} changes in vegetation in the Sahel can cause substantial reductions in rainfall. In some studies, the climate sensitivity {{is large enough to}} trigger drought of the severity observed since the late 1960 s. The extent and intensity of vegetation changes are crucial in determining the magnitude of the atmospheric response in the models. However, there is no accurate historical record of regional vegetation changes extending back to before the drought began. One important driver of vegetation change is land use practice. In this paper the hypothesis that recent changes in land use have been large enough to cause the observed drought is tested. Results from a detailed land use model are used to generate realistic maps of vegetation changes linked to land use. The land use model suggests that cropland coverage in the Sahel has risen from 5 % to 14 % in the 35 yr prior to 1996. It is estimated that this process of <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification,</b> coupled with deforestation and other land use changes, translates to a conversion of 4 % of the land from tree cover to bare soil over this period. The model predicts further changes in the composition of the land surface by 2015 based on changes in human population (rural and urban), livestock population, rainfall, cereals imports, and farming systems. The impact of land use change on Sahelian climate is assessed using a GCM, forced by the estimates of lan...|$|E
40|$|Land cover {{change is}} a {{characteristic}} reflection of a human society interacting with the physical environment. The Zimbabwe-Mozambique-Zambia Transboundary Natural Resources Management Area is a human settled area endowed {{with a variety of}} wildlife (elephants, lions, and buffalo) and wild lands (Dry forests and Miombo ecosystems). However, human-elephant conflicts are known to occur whenever these two species inhabit the same area, which poses serious threat to elephant conservation. The study mapped the extent of land cover changes over a 19 -year period (1989, 2001, and 2008). Landsat™ satellite images were analysed to interpret and detect spatial and temporal land cover changes. Relative to change detection analysis the community perception on the state and cause of human-elephant conflicts and the role of conservation policies were captured through targeted questionnaire guided discussions. Deforestation, cultivation, and human-elephant conflicts increased over the period under review and forest classes decreased while the cultivation class increased. Human-elephant conflict hot spots increased, predominantly in areas where cultivation, settlement, and water sources coincide. Agriculture for livelihood was the major factor driving <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> in ZiMoZa. Weak policing, poor user rights, and pseudo decentralisation of power were policy issues found influencing community resentment towards conservation initiatives in ZiMoZa. The study concluded that extensification of agriculture and human-elephant conflicts will continue to increase in the study area and suggests the need for a paradigm shift from agricultural based livelihood to conservation-based livelihood...|$|E
40|$|International audienceArable fields {{maintaining}} species-rich weed {{communities have}} almost disappeared from European mountain areas due to <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> {{during the last}} decades. The restoration of arable weed communities have become an important issue in these habitats which have a large potential to contain rare and threatened (red-list) species. In a site in the Swiss Alps formerly managed for crop production, we investigated in experimental ploughed plots the 1 -year effects of fertilizing, sowing a mixture of arable weed species and sowing a crop species (triticale) on the natural regeneration (species richness and cover) of arable weed and non-weed species. The high number of newly appeared arable weed species, of which 4 were red-list species, indicates that propagule availability was still important after about 50 years of arable field abandonment. Ploughed plots which did not receive any treatment and those with fertilization alone favoured the regeneration of both wild weed and non-weed species. The crop species limited, but not inhibited, the recovery success of weed and non-weed species and this negative effect tended to be higher under fertilization. Sowing of arable weed seeds decreased the natural regeneration of both weeds and non-weeds in absence of triticale. Our results show that ploughing is a promising method to successfully restore the weed community in abandoned arable mountain areas. Moreover, the sowing of weed species in combination with a crop species might produce sustainable food and restore and maintain the diversity of threatened arable weeds at the same time...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of society {{hinges on the}} future of agriculture. Though alternatives to unsustainable, high-input industrial agriculture are available, agricultural systems have been slow to transition to them. Much of the resistance to adopting alternative techniques stems from the perceived costs of alternative agriculture, mainly in terms of yields. The general assumption is that agriculture that is less harmful to people and wildlife directly will be indirectly more harmful because of yield losses that lead to food shortages in the short-term and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification</b> in the long-term. Though the yield gap between industrial and alternative forms of agriculture is often discussed, does industrial agriculture actually produce the highest yields? In addition, to what aspects of the food system is yield relevant? We review the evidence for differences in crop yields between industrial and alternative systems and then evaluate the contribution of yields in determining whether people are fed, the land in production, and practices farmers will adopt. In both organic and conservation agriculture, different combinations of crops, climate and diversification practices outperformed industrial agriculture, and thus we find little evidence that high input systems always outperform alternative forms of agriculture. Yield, however, is largely irrelevant to determining whether people are fed or the amount of land in production. A focus on increasing yields alone to feed the world or protect biodiversity will achieve neither goal. To promote sustainable agriculture, we must move past focusing on these oversimplified relationships to disentangling the complex social and ecological factors, and determine how to provide adequate nutrition for people while protecting biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{systems are}} {{geographically}} extensive, have profound significance to society, and affect regional energy, climate, and water cycles. Since most suitable lands worldwide have been cultivated, {{there is a}} growing pressure to increase yields on existing agricultural lands. In tropical and subtropical regions, multicropping is widely used to increase food production, but regional-to-global information related to multicropping practices is poor. The high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution of the MODIS sensors provide an ideal source of information for characterizing cropping practices over large areas. Relative to studies that document <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification,</b> however, systematic assessment of agricultural intensification via multicropping has received relatively little attention. The goal of this work was to help close this information gap by developing methods that use multitemporal remote sensing to map multicropping systems in Asia. Image time-series analysis is especially challenging {{in this part of the}} world because atmospheric conditions including clouds and aerosols lead to high frequencies of missing or low-quality observations, especially during the Asian Monsoon. The methodology that we developed builds upon the algorithm used to produce the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics product (MCD 12 Q 2), but uses an improved methodology optimized for crops. We assessed our results at the aggregate scale using state, district, and provincial level inventory statistics reporting total cropped and harvested areas, and at the field scale using survey results for 191 field sites in Bangladesh. While the algorithm highlighted the dominant continental-scale patterns in agricultural practices throughout Asia, and produced reasonable estimates of state and provincial level total harvested areas, field-scale assessment revealed significant challenges in mapping high cropping intensity due to abundant missing data...|$|E
40|$|Global {{biodiversity}} loss {{is driven}} principally by {{the expansion of}} agriculture. This expansion has slowed over the last 50 years as agricultural production has intensified, largely {{through the use of}} petrochemical-based fertilisers. The mid- 2000 s saw a transition where oil production became unresponsive to the increased demand for petrochemicals, pushing up their price and that of their end-products, including fertilisers. Such oil supply constraints threaten to reverse previous agricultural intensification gains and increase pressure for the conversion of native ecosystems. Price-driven land and food speculation and the search for alternative energy sources also have the potential to increase the demand for land. This study aimed to measure the change in the rate of deforestation and to map the resultant impact on biodiversity as oil production became inelastic in 2005. Globally, an additional 290, 000 km of forests was cleared in the period 2007 - 12 compared with 2000 - 2006, which is a net increase of 29 % between the two periods. The areas of increased forest loss broadly corresponded with the areas of highest biodiversity. We tested for, but found little correspondence with large-scale, corporate land acquisitions. Statistically significant hotspots of increased threat to biodiversity generally lie in a band through the tropics, particularly in south-east Asia, Africa and Central America, with fertiliser consumption affected in hotspot areas. A review of the drivers in these hotspots indicated that non-subsistence growth factors underpin most land-cover change. We conclude that conservation efforts need to mitigate pressures from growth and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification,</b> and be aware that the rate of loss increased with oil supply constraint in tropical and sub-tropical regions, coinciding with the areas of highest biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an Agent-Based Model (ABM) used to simulate land use change on household farms in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). The ABM simulates decision-making processes at the household level that is examined through a longitudinal, socio-economic and demographic survey that was conducted in 1990 and 1999. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to establish spatial relationships between farms and their environment, while classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is used to set initial land-use/land-cover conditions for the spatial simulation, assess from-to land-use/land-cover change patterns, and describe trajectories of land use change at the farm and landscape levels. Results from prior studies in the NEA provide insights into the key social and ecological variables, describe human behavioral functions, and examine population–environment interactions that are linked to deforestation and <b>agricultural</b> <b>extensification,</b> population migration, and demographic change. Within {{the architecture of the}} model, agents are classified as active or passive. The model comprises four modules, i. e., initialization, demography, agriculture, and migration that operate individually, but are linked through key household processes.
