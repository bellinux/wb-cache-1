The research has determined that the transaction costs, introduced as a new concept in the first half of XX century, have the key importance in the development of business activities in any company (enterprise). In the work was identified socioeconomic basis for the formation of transaction costs in a market economy, also was settled the necessity to manage them and find ways to reduce them. The work has noticed that many types of transaction costs can?t be observed directly, that is why they are difficult to be measured statistically. However, the cost reduction is one of the urgent tasks for the implementation of positive changes into the national economies, it is essential for their development. ? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ???????????????? ????????????, ???????? ?? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?? ???????????? ????????

40|$|Context: Palliative care {{clinical}} practice depends upon an evidence-based decision-making process {{which in turn}} is based upon current research evidence. One of the most important goals in clinical palliative care is to improve patients' quality of life (QoL). Aim: This study aimed to perform a quantitative analysis of research publications in palliative care journals for reporting characteristics of articles on QoL. Settings and Design: This was a systematic review of palliative care journals. Materials and Methods: Twelve palliative care journals were searched for articles with "QoL" in the title of the articles published from 2006 to 2010. The reporting rates of all journals were compared. The selected articles were categorized into assessment and treatment, and subsequently grouped into original and review articles. The original articles were subgrouped into qualitative and quantitative studies, and the review articles were grouped into narrative and systematic reviews. Each subgroup of original <b>article</b> <b>category</b> was further classified according to study designs.

Articles under this category are intended to provide authentic and qualified opinions on topics relevant to the journal. These articles and follow-up discussions will pass through an accelerated, mainly editorial, review process. We invite readers to respond to such articles by sharing their personal thoughts and experiences, {{as well as to}} initiate new discussions. We hope these contributions will make the journal a site for lively discussions on research practice. For this first “Viewpoint” we have selected a topic that should be of interest to many readers: What key research competencies will researchers and professionals need to have in the future? To introduce the topic, we look into a recent comparative study on this question that compares the situation in eight research-intensive countries. Reports on the study are available for free download, which can serve as a basis for discussion. In keeping with the idea of “Viewpoints & Discussion,” no claim to offering a systematic and scholarly account of the topic is intended; the only aim is to throw a spotlight on a theme of current interest and to suggest a few pertinent conjectures and questions for discussion...|$|E

In this thesis a prediction system has been developed to predict the number of comments a news article in Slovene language will generate based on news text content and metadata. We got the best prediction results from bold parts of the text, coupled with metadata attributes and the extended gradient boosted regression trees model which builds separate models for each <b>article</b> <b>category.</b> Our analysis has proven that with proper data preprocessing and use of machine learning techniques it is possible to successfully predict the number of comments an article gets.

30|$|In {{the second}} step, 513 {{consumer}} articles {{were selected from}} the retail market {{in the area of}} Ulm and Stuttgart between August 29 and October 24, 2016. Article groups were preferred which had a certain probability to contain SVHCs as found out in step one. Many articles sold by well-known, large, and/or multinational companies were considered, because their quantitative impact on the total amount of SVHCs present in consumer articles might be large and their share of the supply offered to consumers will be larger compared to small companies. The barcode numbers printed on the labels of the articles were entered into the online tool offered by the German Federal Environment Agency [6]. Currently, the online tool is being reprogrammed and therefore not available. The smartphone app Scan 4 Chem [7] may be used instead. No requests were made by other means, such as by written letters via postal mail, by fax, by phone, or by direct face-to-face communication at the retailer of the articles. Requests were made preferentially for several articles of the same <b>article</b> <b>category</b> originating from different brands. This mimics the situation of a consumer who wants to buy a certain article without SVHCs and who does not want to wait again up to 45  days if the first article response declared the presence of SVHCs. Interested consumers would make several simultaneous information requests for comparable articles. The answers received by the suppliers or distributors were collected and analyzed and compared to results by previous studies.|$|E

40|$|Databases {{catalogue}} {{the corpus}} of research literature into scientific categories and report classes of bibliometric data {{such as the}} number of citations to articles, the number of authors, journals, funding agencies, institutes, references, etc. The number of articles and citations in a category are gauges of productivity and scientific impact but a quantitative basis to compare researchers between categories is limited. Here, we compile a list of bibliometric indicators for 236 science categories and citation rates of the 500 most cited <b>articles</b> of each <b>category.</b> The number of citations per paper vary by several orders of magnitude and are highest in multidisciplinary sciences, general internal medicine, and biochemistry and lowest in literature, poetry, and dance. A regression model demonstrates that citation rates to the top <b>articles</b> in each <b>category</b> increase with the square root of the number of <b>articles</b> in a <b>category</b> and decrease proportionately with the age of the references: <b>articles</b> in <b>categories</b> that cite recent research are also cited more frequently. The citation rate correlates positively with the number of funding agencies that finance the research. The category h-index correlates with the average number of cites to the top 500 ranked <b>articles</b> of each <b>category</b> (R 2 = 0. 997).
