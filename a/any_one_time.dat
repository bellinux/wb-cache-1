5|$|Not {{all of the}} castles were {{occupied}} simultaneously. Some were built during the invasions and then abandoned while other new castles were constructed elsewhere, especially along the western borders.

5|$|The brain {{produces}} roughly 500mL of {{cerebrospinal fluid}} per day, {{at a rate}} of about 25mL an hour. This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125â€“150mL is present at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in a simple {{snapshot}} of {{the locations of the}} asteroids at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.|$|E
5|$|To run {{a typical}} peak morning commute, BART {{requires}} 579 cars. Of those, 535 {{are scheduled to}} be in active service; the others are used to build up four spare trains (essential for maintaining on-time service).

Approximately 400 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by approximately 1100 traditional part-time air guardsmen. Approximately 100 additional foreign military {{personnel are}} also temporarily assigned to the 118 AW at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> for training in the C-130E or C-130H aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E

In June 2012, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that Final Fantasy XI had become the most profitable title in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
50|$|Tunnels, due {{to their}} nature, {{restrict}} fields of fire and thus any troops in a tunnel usually {{only have a few}} areas exposed to fire or sight at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> particular <b>time.</b> Also they can be part of an extensive labyrinth and have cul-de-sacs as well as reduced lighting that can create a closed-in night environment.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> and P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} by E.O. Wilson that {{the total number of}} individual ants alive in the world at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> is between one and ten quadrillion (short scale) (i.e. between 1015 and 1016). According to this estimate, the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race. Also, according to this estimate, there are approximately 1 million ants for every human on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Kumba {{features}} four {{steel and}} fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. The block sections only allow for three trains to be on the track at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three train operation, the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour.|$|E

If anything, we are over-ready, straining with over-readiness." ...|$|R
5|$|Lord Howe Island {{is known}} for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist {{activities}} include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing. To relieve pressure on the small island environment only 400 tourists are permitted at <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time.</b> The island is reached by plane from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 has similar management guidelines to a National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} (often called hieroglyphs from a {{superficial}} {{resemblance to the}} Ancient Egyptian writing) is a logosyllabic writing system, combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words. Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language. At <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.|$|E
5|$|The long-running HUG process {{complicated}} the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s. At <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> {{the capabilities of}} individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron {{was replaced by a}} system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common pool to each squadron were not successful.|$|E
