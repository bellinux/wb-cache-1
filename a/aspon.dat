While -ҳо {{can be used with}} any noun, the suffix -он is primarily used with animate nouns and has the variants -ён (-yon) which is used with words ending in -ӣ, ӯ or -о, -вон (-von) for words ending in у, and -гон (-gon) which is used with words ending in -а. For example, the singular for 'horse' is асп (asp), and the plural, 'horses' can be either аспҳо (aspho) or аспон (<b>aspon).</b> Typically, the -он (-on) ending is reserved for animate objects, although this is not always true. For example, body parts that come in pairs, such as даст ("dast"), meaning [...] "hand" [...] and чашм ("chashm"), meaning [...] "eye" [...] are pluralized as дастон ("daston") and чашмон ("chashmon"), respectively.|$|E

40|$|The <b>aspon</b> model {{provides}} {{an alternative to}} the KM mechanism for CP violation with the advantage that the strong CP problem is solved. We consider the incorporation of low-energy supersymmetry and find the constraints on alignment and squark degeneracy. The conclusion is that although the ¯ θ constraints are much less severe than in other generic schemes with supersymmetry breaking and spontaneous CP violation, one restriction remains stronger than needed in the MSSM for suppression of FCNC. Typeset using REVTEX 1 One model of spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) is the <b>aspon</b> model which was first proposed [1] in 1990 and developed in subsequent papers [2, 3]. The principal advantage over the standard model is that the strong CP problem is solved.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} ruminant gut tissues have the capability to synthesize urea in a short-term incubation. Mixed primary cell cultures containing ruminal epithelial (REC) or duodenal muco-sal cells (DMC) were isolated from growing sheep (n = 4) fed a mixed forage-concentrate diet. Cells were incu-bated (90 min) in a Krebs salts-based buffer with either acetate (5 mM) or propionate (5 mM) plus a combination of substrate intermediates (5 mM) for urea synthesis: arginine, aspartate + citrulline (AspC), aspartate + or-nithine + ammonia (<b>AspON),</b> or <b>AspON</b> + N-carbamo-ylglutamate (AspONG) in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments. Volatile fatty acid, propionate vs. ace-tate, did not influence net urea synthesis. For REC, net urea synthesis (nmoles(106 cells) − 190 min− 1) was greatest with Arg (54. 5 ± 6. 3) followed by AspC (4. 6 ± 1. 1) and AspONG (3. 6 ± 1. 4). For DMC, net urea synthe-sis for Arg (2. 1 ± 0. 7) andAspONG (1. 9 ± 0. 7) treatments was greater than for AspC (0. 3 ± 0. 7) and <b>AspON</b> (− 0. 6 ± 0. 7) treatments. Thus, for both REC andDMC, arginase activity appeared to be sufficient for catabolism of argi-nine to urea. Furthermore, greater urea synthesis from ammonia, ornithine and aspartate in the presence of theN-acetylglutamate analogue suggests that carbam-oyl phosphate synthetase is probably rate-limiting for urea synthesis and ammonia detoxification by rumi-nant gut tissues.

The extent {{of growth of}} two Pseudomonas strains in media containing diazinon and malathion was in the range expected from the amount of insecticide supplied, and their proliferation resulted in disappearance of the chemical.

A linear relation between the CP asymmetries of different decay processes is obtained. 1 Typeset using REVTEXThe violation of CP symmetry was a surprising experimental discovery made almost thirty years ago in the neutral kaon system [1]. In field theory, one profound question about CP is whether it is explicitly broken in the fundamental lagrangian or only spontaneously broken by the vacuum. Within the standard model explicit CP violation can be accommodated in the flavor mixing of three families by the Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) mechanism [2]. The experimental information regarding CP violation still comes only from the neutral kaon system and is inadequate to determine whether the KM mechanism is the correct underpinning of CP violation. In dedicated B studies, with more than 10 8 samples of B 0 (¯ B 0) decay, it will be possible [3] to test this assumption stringently by measuring the angles of the well-known unitarity triangle whose sides correspond to the complex terms of the equatio...|$|E

40|$|We study four {{different}} models for CP violation: the standard (KM) model, the <b>aspon</b> model of spontaneous breaking and two models of soft breaking. In all except the standard model, the strong CP problem is addressed and solved. Testable predictions {{for the area}} of the unitarity triangle and for (epsilon'/epsilon) _K are emphasized. The issue of CP violation may well become the first place where the standard model of particle theory is shown definitively to be deficient. There are two reasons for expecting this to happen: (1) the strong CP problem is still not understood in the unadorned standard model and (2) the KM mechanism, although unquestionably present, may not provide the full explanation of epsilon_K and (epsilon'/epsilon) _K.

40|$|In a model where CP is spontaneously broken, the <b>aspon</b> model, it {{is shown}} by {{extending}} previous arguments about B decay {{and the value of}} Re(ǫ ′ /ǫ) in the kaon system, that the neutron electric dipole moment Dn is bounded from below by Dn ≥ 10 − 29 e. -cm.

E is odd under CP and even under P because E is odd under P and even under CP. Thus a non-vanishing NEDM would be an explicit example of CP violation, outside of the kaon system. The discovery of a NEDM will be very important in formulating the theory of CP violation where the problem is the fact that only one (complex) parameter, ǫK, has been accurately measured. The second parameter in the kaon system, Re(ǫ ′ /ǫ), remains uncertain- it is still consistent with zero- and the CP asymmetries in B meson decays have ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} CP {{violation}} {{is a major}} mystery, especially {{in relation to the}} strong CP problem. CP being a spontaneously broken symmetry could provide an elegant solution. However, such models have difficulty making themselves compatible with low-energy supersymmetry, which is popularly accepted as the solution to the hierarchy problem. We demonstrate that a certain class of low scale supersymmetric "Nelson-Barr" type models can solve the strong and supersymmetric CP problems {{while at the same time}} generating sufficient weak CP violation in the K^ 0 -K̅^ 0 system. Gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking is used to provide the needed squark mass degeneracies and A-term proportionalities; though that proves to be still insufficient for a generic Nelson-Barr model. The workable model we consider here, essentially a supersymmetric version of the <b>aspon</b> model, has the Nelson-Barr mass texture enforced by a U(1) gauge symmetry, broken at the TeV scale. The resulting model is predictive with rich phenomenology soon to be available. Feasibility of the model considered is established by a detailed renormalization group studies.

The developed GC-EI/SIM, GC-NCI/SIM, and GC-NCI/SRM are suitable for the determination of pesticides in air sample extracts at concentrations < 100 pg µL− 1 (< 100 pg m− 3 in air). No one method {{could be used to}} analyze the range of pre-emergent herbicides, OPs, and OCs investigated.

GC-EI/SRM at concentration < 100 pg µL− 1 was not suitable for most pesticides. GC-EI/SIM was more prone to interference issues than NCI methods, but gave good sensitivity (MDLs 1 – 10 pg µL− 1) for pesticides with poor NCI response (OPs: sulfotep, phorate, <b>aspon,</b> ethion, and OCs: alachlor, aldrin, perthane, and DDE, DDD, DDT) ...|$|E
