25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took <b>away</b> <b>my</b> pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

Just as rain washes away dirt, love washes clean the sorrows of the past, leaving a person and their lover to focus on their feelings of the present moment.

[...] According to Stephen Sears from music website Idolator, [...] "the synths turbo-charge at 2:46 into a sleek middle eight that features dueling Madonnas reciting lines of poetry out of the left and right channels [...] 'By sheer force of will / I'll raise you from the ground', she says softly, 'And without a sound, you'll appear and surrender to me, to love'."

500|$|The {{image of}} life as a sea voyage to the Kingdom of Heaven in the first recitative comes from the opening of the Gospel reading: [...] "There He went on board a ship and passed over and came into His own city" [...] (...) [...] Affirmations that God will not forsake the {{faithful}} on this journey and will lead them out of tribulation come from [...] and [...] The third movement expresses the joy at being united with the Saviour; the text comes from : [...] "Those that wait upon the Lord shall gain new strength so that they mount up with wings like an eagle, so that they run and do not grow weary." [...] This joy is coupled with a yearning for death, a theme that is present until {{the very end of the}} work. The concluding chorale is the sixth stanza of Johann Franck's hymn [...] "" [...] (1653), which also alludes to the ship imagery, saying [...] "Löse meines Schiffleins Ruder, bringe mich an sichern Port" [...] (release the rudder of my little ship, bring me to the secure harbor).

500|$|The opening aria, [...] "" [...] (I will gladly {{carry the}} Cross), is in bar form AAB, with two stollen (A) {{followed}} by an abgesang (B). The first stollen starts with a ritornello for full orchestra, anticipating in counterpoint the rising and then falling motif of the bass soloist, mounting to an anguished augmented second marking the word [...] (Cross), followed by descending sighing figures signalling the bearing of the cross. After the entry of the soloist, with its long and expressive melismatic lines, the three groups of strings and oboes accompany in counterpoint and echoing responses drawn from motifs of the opening ritornello. The ritornello is then taken up in the second stollen, but with significant variations because of the differing text: [...] "It leads me after my torments to God in the Promised Land". After {{a repeat of the}} opening ritornello, the final abgesang illustrates the words, [...] "There at last I will lay my sorrow in the grave, there my Savior himself will wipe <b>away</b> <b>my</b> tears." [...] Declamatory triplets, dramatically spanning the whole bass register, are responded to by sighing motifs in the accompaniment. A reprise of the orchestral ritornello brings the aria to a close.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} plot {{element is}} House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, {{caused by an}} infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane. In the first season, 11th episode [...] "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but {{says he does not}} have a problem because the pills [...] "let me do my job, and they take <b>away</b> <b>my</b> pain". His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times. When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a [...] "big drinker". Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, Wilson and he determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause. House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but {{at the close of the}} season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control. However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, [...] "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin, and his addiction recurs.|$|E
500|$|At first, Nevermind did {{not receive}} many reviews, and many {{publications}} ignored the album. Months after its release and after [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] garnered airplay, print media organizations were [...] "scrambling" [...] to cover the phenomenon the album had become. However, by that point, much of the attention fell on Cobain rather than the album itself. The reviews that did initially appear were largely positive. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, [...] "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." [...] Schoemer concluded, [...] "'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind, Nirvana [...] "never entertain the notion" [...] of wanting to sound [...] "normal," [...] compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that [...] "When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they {{had the potential to}} make an album that would blow every other contender <b>away.</b> <b>My</b> God have they proved us right." [...] Spin gave Nevermind a favorable review stating that [...] "you'll be humming all the songs {{for the rest of your}} life—or at least until your CD-tape-album wears out." [...] Select compared the band to Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, stating that the album [...] "proves that Nirvana truly belong in such high company." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw <b>away</b> <b>my</b> old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very deep green and I believed I was upside down {{and the sky was}} the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", have been described as [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail <b>away</b> <b>my</b> little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E
