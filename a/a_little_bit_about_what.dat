Went into Nova Scotia, at the time Acadia, and settled there and was there for about a hundred years, and afterwards the British took over the territory and then the French-speaking people, the French descendants, known as the Acadians, came down to the South-Western part of Louisiana, and that was back in 1755. So over all of these years, your language, and your music has been preserved from daddy to son or daddy to daughter or momma to daughter." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2004 interview, Guthrie {{spoke about}} spirituality {{and the role}} it plays {{in his life and}} on Outlasting the Blues. I'm not a big fan of overly happy spirituality ... Life ain’t happy all the time. For me, spirituality is not about being happy. It's about what to do when times are tough, not just for you {{personally}} but for everybody. There are times when disasters strike ... So, for me, spirituality is what to do about that, and then what to do in your own personal life when you're confronting things that hurt, things that ain't fun. Outlasting the Blues was about that. It was not about preachin', it was not about telling people what's right, although there's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I found was right.|$|E

And we flashback to an encounter John had with Odin Quincannon when Jesse was just a kid. As Jesse's grown up and come back to this town, Quincannon's been sort of the ultimate white whale of sin. He's a professed atheist; he's also {{the most powerful man in}} town, he basically runs Annville." [...] Catlin concluded his segment of the featurette by speaking of the present timeline with Jesse and Odin, with Catlin saying, [...] "Jesse's trying to coax Odin to come to church, just this one Sunday. For Jesse, he's the ultimate challenge, 'If I can show the town that I can bring Odin Quincannon to God then everyone else will follow'." [...] Catlin continues, [...] "Jesse pros him and asks him 'what about Hell? aren't you worried about going to Hell?' But he turns the tables on Jesse, he's like 'I'm not the one that's worried about Hell, you're the one that's worried about Hell' And that's the turn of the scene." ...|$|E

5000|$|The one-hour show is {{hosted by}} comedian Mo Mandel (from Comedy Central Presents). He travels across the United States and pits two bar owners {{against each other}} {{to see who can}} turn the most profit. But the twist is they have to run each other's bars for a night. How the show works is Mandel {{introduces}} each bar owner. Each owner then gets to talk <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> their bar offers and how they run things. Then the owners travel to each other's bars to spend a week there and meet the staff. In repeated interviews, the owners talk about how they feel about how the other bar is run and what types of changes they would make if they were the owner. Later on during the week, the owners [...] "take over" [...] the establishment and implement their rules and TV viewers observe how the staff reacts to these changes. Many times, there is friction between the staff and the owners at this stage in the competition. One major stipulation of the show is that the new owner cannot fire any staff members for breaking any of the new rules, but can discipline them in other ways. Finally, there is the [...] "relaunch" [...] night where the owner has complete control of the bar. This is the night that counts towards the profit totals which will determine who wins the competition. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.|$|E
50|$|Opinion {{leaders are}} {{the first step in}} the {{elements}} of persuasion. This is most important to the pre-purchase experience when a consumer is most interested in the marketing of the product they are intending to buy. The power of the persuasion that the opinion leader possesses will change depending on many different factors. The first is their credibility, this also works in turn with perceived trustworthiness. Consumers are more likely to believe that the campaign is genuine if the opinion leader is someone who has a reputation for being honest and credible. Another factor is their expertise in that field, although they don't have to be at an opinion formers level of expertise, any previous actions, study or jobs that may help the consumer believe that they do know <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they are promoting, also helps with the authenticity of the advert. For some, the more superficial values hold the most weight in persuasion so the mere fact that the OL is attractive is a key for them, also their social standing not only effects the reach of promotion, but also can attribute to the persuasiveness. People who are the most effected by opinion leaders are those who are often engaged under the peripheral route. The peripheral route is less analytical of the actual product at hand, but will be persuaded due to other factors including an opinion leader that the consumer likes, or attractive elements of the packaging. Whereas those who undertake the central route of persuasion are less affected by these often superficial features and are more likely to choose an option based on the merits of the products or the strength of the argument.|$|E
