5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E
25|$|Scarlett and {{his command}} group, two aides and a trumpeter, {{were the first}} to reach the Russian cavalry. The rest of the brigade {{followed}} closely. As they neared the Russian line, they started to take carbine fire, which killed the Scots Greys' commander and took the hat off of its executive officer. The Scots Greys finally came abreast of the Inniskillings just short of the Russians and the two regiments finally were able to gallop. As the Inniskillings shouted their battle cry, Faugh A Ballagh, observers reported that the Scots Greys made an eerie, growling moan. The Scots Greys charged through the Russian cavalry, along with the Inniskilings, <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> melee among the mass of Russian cavalry. With both forces disordered by the charge, it became clear to the regimental adjutant of the Scots Greys that, to avoid be overwhelmed by Russian numbers, the Scots Greys had to reform. Pushed back from the centre of the mass, the Scots Greys reformed around the adjutant and drove again into the Russian cavalry. Seeing that the Scots Greys were again cut off, the Royal Dragoons, finally arriving to the fight after disobeying Scarlett's order to remain with the Light Brigade, charged to their assistance, helping to push the Russians back. Amid the hacking and slashing of the sabre battle, the Russian cavalry had had enough, and retreated back up the hill, pursued for a short time by the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} regiments.|$|E
500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat thought better of shooting the King, <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E

500|$|The British {{lost sight}} of the Germans until [...] spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 8:05 p.m., then {{identified}} and engaged several German torpedo boats. Hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only [...] away. Inflexible opened fire at 8:20, followed almost immediately {{by the rest of the}} battlecruisers. Shortly after 8:30, the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear-Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans only fired a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist around 8:40. Beatty's battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 2:55 a.m.|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cloud. I have never seen a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E
500|$|The {{cabin crew}} started the evacuation, {{even before the}} plane {{had come to a}} halt, via both forward galley doors, both rear doors and the {{starboard}} overwing exits. Eighteen passengers escaped via the overwing exits before the fire grew too intense to use that route. The forward port galley door escape slide caught fire before it could be used, but one person jumped from there. 84 people escaped via the starboard galley door. Three of the crew escaped by the emergency cockpit rope. The rear starboard door escape slide had twisted on deployment, so Steward Taylor climbed down to straighten it, leaving stewardess Jane Harrison at the door assisting the passengers. Six passengers escaped via this route before the slide was punctured and deflated. Harrison encouraged the passengers to jump, and pushed out those too frightened to do so. 11 people escaped via this route, and five more escaped via the rear port door before the slide was destroyed. Harrison was last seen alive preparing to jump herself, but then she turned back <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> burning fuselage in an attempt to save the remaining four female passengers, including a disabled woman and eight-year-old girl. It was these actions which led to the award of the George Cross posthumously [...] to Harrison in recognition of her selfless gallantry. 35 people were injured, and five killed.|$|E

500|$|The Brigade {{travelled}} {{by night}} and at dawn on 9 October the Ayrshire Yeomanry, {{who were in}} the vanguard, disturbed a Boer encampment. [...] The Boers fled on horseback and Trenchard with his Australians pursued them for [...] [...] The Boers, finding themselves unable to shake off Trenchard's unit, led them into a trap. [...] The Boers rode up a steep slope <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> valley beyond. [...] When Trenchard made the ridge he saw the Dwarsvlei farmhouse with smoke coming from the chimney. [...] It appeared to Trenchard that the Boers thought they had got away and were eating breakfast unawares. [...] Trenchard placed his troops on the heights around the building and after half an hour's observation, he led a patrol of four men down towards the farmhouse. [...] The remainder of Trenchard's troops were to close in on his signal. [...] However, when Trenchard and his patrol reached the valley floor and broke cover, the Boers opened fire from about a dozen points and bullets whistled past Trenchard and his men. [...] He pressed forward reaching the sheltering wall of the farmhouse. [...] As he headed for the door, Trenchard was hit by a Boer bullet to the chest. [...] The Australians, seeing their leader fall, descended from the heights to engage the Boers at close quarters in and around the farmhouse. [...] Many of the Boers were killed or wounded, a few fled and several were taken prisoner. [...] Trenchard being critically wounded was medically evacuated to Krugersdorp.|$|E

Tarleton claimed that 51 of his men were killed or wounded. [...] Most modern commentators credit higher numbers for the British casualties: 92 killed and 75-100 wounded. American casualties were 3 killed, 4 wounded, and 50 captured.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1923, {{the gang}} robbed $23,000 {{in cash and}} {{securities}} from a bank in Pompano. Like many of their heists, {{this was followed by}} reckless celebrating in the streets. After wrapping the loot in a bedsheet, they slowly drove through the middle of the town in a stolen taxi. They waved a bottle of whiskey to onlookers and shouted [...] "We got it all!". Leaving the town, they crossed a canal <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swamp near Clewiston. Ashley supposedly left a bullet with one of the victims to give to Sheriff Baker if he [...] "ever got out to the 'Glades".|$|E
2500|$|Duchesne pressed on, with de Borelli's legionnaires {{leading the}} way. [...] Ten {{minutes later the}} column reached a deep and nearly {{vertical}} ravine, with a Chinese fort on the other side. [...] The Chinese in the fort opened fire at the French vanguard, and de Borelli ordered his weary men to fix bayonets and charge. [...] The legionnaires scrambled down the ravine and up the other side, without returning fire. [...] The Chinese abandoned their defences before the French could close with them, <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forests of Yu Oc. [...] De Borelli and Chanu pushed forward to the Yu Oc pagoda and deployed their companies to form a defensive screen, while Herbin and Moulinay's men {{set fire to the}} Chinese barracks and destroyed part of their works.|$|E

5000|$|A line {{of flight}} (ligne de fuite) {{is a concept}} {{developed}} by Gilles Deleuze and used extensively in his work with Félix Guattari. Translator Brian Massumi notes that in French, [...] "Fuite covers not only the act of fleeing or eluding but also flowing, leaking, <b>and</b> <b>disappearing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance (the vanishing point in a painting is a point de fuite).

2500|$|The {{vertical}} maneuver, {{known as}} a [...] "vector roll," [...] positioned his Phantom above the tighter-turning MiG-21, then when it completed its turn, Olds dropped in behind it and fired two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. [...] One struck the MiG's right wing and tore it off. [...] The MiG went into a spiral <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clouds below, the second kill of the battle. [...] At nearly the same time, Olds 04, flown by Capt. Walter S. Radeker III, spotted a MiG tracking his element lead and maneuvered to engage it. [...] Radeker was unable get a consistently good tone (which would indicate missile lock), but launched. [...] His Sidewinder guided perfectly, however, and struck the MiG {{just in front of}} its tail, sending it into a spin. [...] Olds flight had destroyed three MiG-21s without suffering a loss and at its fuel consumption limits left the area.|$|E
