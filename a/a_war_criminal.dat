5|$|The U.S. {{realized}} that Batista {{would lose the}} war, and fearing that Castro would displace U.S. interests with socialist reforms, decided to aid Batista's removal by supporting a rightist military junta, believing that General Cantillo, then commanding most of the country's armed forces, should lead it. After being approached with this proposal, Cantillo secretly met with Castro, agreeing that the two would call a ceasefire, following which Batista would be apprehended and tried as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>criminal.</b> Double-crossing Castro, Cantillo warned Batista of the revolutionary's intentions. Wishing to avoid a tribunal, Batista resigned on 31 December 1958, informing the armed forces that they were now under Cantillo's control. With his family and closest advisers, Batista fled into exile to the Dominican Republic with over US$ 300,000,000. Cantillo then entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new President, and began appointing new members of the government.|$|E
5|$|As UN {{air raids}} against the North Koreans intensified, Dean {{was moved to}} Sunan, north of P'yongyang, to a hut where he lived with several guards. They began daily interrogations {{primarily}} aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written condemnation of the UN intervention in Korea, but Dean adamantly refused to do so.

Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food {{but he was not}} given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily.

Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography, General Dean's Story.
