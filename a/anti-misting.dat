It culminated on December 1, 1984, when he {{remotely}} flew an unpiloted, heavily instrumented Boeing 720 to a prepared impact point on Rogers Dry Lake {{to test the}} flammability of <b>anti-misting</b> jet fuel in a crash situation.|$|E
40|$|Solutions of polyisobutylenes L 160, L 200, B 200, and B 230 in Jet-A were {{prepared}} at concentrations up to 3000 ppm. These polymers have molecular weights {{in the range}} 5 to 9 x 1, 00, 000 and have previously been shown to induce <b>anti-misting</b> properties in Jet-A. In connection with the pumpability of such solutions, especially at low temperatures, the shear viscosity, eta, of these solutions was measured at temperatures 25 C, 0 C, and - 25 C. Concentration-dependence of eta was very similar for all four polymer solutes, the increase of eta(c) at 3000 ppm being roughly four-fold (relative to Jet-A) for the L-series and five-fold for the B-series. This behavior prevailed at all temperatures, {{and there was no}} evidence of phase separation or other chemical instability at - 25 C at any concentration. In the more practical c-range for <b>anti-misting</b> applications, say within 1000 ppm, the increase of eta(c) was only twofold...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAker Solutions has {{developed}} a novel emission control system involving the combination of <b>anti-mist</b> design and an acid wash polishing step. This concept was tested at a 200 kg/h CO 2 Mobile Test Unit (MTU) operating on flue gas from a Residual Catalytic Cracker (RCC). It {{was found that the}} RCC gas contained relatively high concentration of H 2 SO 4 mist (up to 33 mg/Nm 3) compared to what is typically seen from a modern coal-fired power station. The high concentration of H 2 SO 4 nuclei generated high amine emission (> 200 ppm) when the MTU was operated in conventional mode. On the other hand when the MTU was operated in <b>anti-mist</b> mode the emissions were greatly reduced and amine emissions down to 2 ppm were confirmed by manual emission measurements. A test with conventional mist abatement technology (Brownian diffusion filter) installed upstream the MTU was also performed. It was shown that the filter had large removal efficiency of H 2 SO 4, however still significant amine emissions persisted when the MTU was not operated in <b>anti-mist</b> mode. The results clearly demonstrate that the Aker Solutions’ <b>Anti-Mist</b> design is an attractive option for mist abatement compared to conventional technology...|$|R

By using nanotechnology, materials can effectively be made to be stronger, lighter, more durable. Recent attention focuses on nano composite materials and coatings. The nano materials and their corresponding nanocoating usage are mentioned briefly. Some nanocoating techniques such as Waterproof nanocoating, Electrostatic layer-by-layer nanocoating, Anti-graffiti and Sol-gel nanocoating, <b>Anti-mist</b> nanocoating, UV and IR protection nanocoating, Anti-glare nanocoating, are pronounced with their promising applications...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Full Scale Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) {{program is}} a joint NASA/FAA effort to test {{improvements}} in aircraft crashworthiness. Specifically, a transport aircraft was modified to be remotely piloted by telemetry control and flown into a “survivable” crash. On board was a fuel cargo of <b>anti-misting</b> kerosene (AMK) to inhibit post crash fires. Also, various measurements were made to examine crash structural response, and improvements in new seat and restraint design using instrumented anthropomorphic dummies. Mechanization of the remote uplink telemetry command system and the downlink data systems is described...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a brief {{overview}} of work over the last several decades in understanding what occurs to jet fuel stored in aircraft fuel tanks on impact with the ground. Fuel dispersal is discussed in terms of the overall crash dynamics process and impact regimes are identified. In a generic sense, the types of flow regimes which can occur are identified and general descriptions of the processes are given. Examples of engineering level tools, both computational and experimental, which have applicability to analyzing the complex environments are presented. Finally, risk based decision is discussed as a quick means of identifying requirements for development of preventative or mitigation strategies, such as further work on the development of an <b>anti-misting</b> agent...|$|E
40|$|The <b>anti-misting</b> {{additive}} for {{jet fuels}} known as FM- 9 (proprietary polymer) {{was characterized by}} elemental analysis, solubility studies and molecular weight determination. Physical properties of surface tension, viscosity, specific gravity and other physical parameters were determined. These results are compared with properties of polyisobutylene and fuels modified with the same; the misting characteristics of polyisobutylene and FM- 9 in Jet A fuel are included. Characterization and degradation of phthalocyanine and its derivatives were accomplished by use of a mass spectrometer and a pyroprobe solid pyrolyzer. Metal phthalocyanine tetracarboxylic acids and phthalocyanine-tetraamine cured epoxies were studied. Epoxy/graphite composite panels were exposed to a NASA-Ames radiant panel fire simulator in the flaming and non-flaming modes; toxic gases of HCN and HZS were measured along with oxygen, Co 2, Co, and organic gases...|$|E
40|$|Impact-survivable postcrash fire {{accidents}} were surveyed. The {{data base}} developed includes {{foreign and domestic}} accidents involving airlines and jet aircraft. The {{emphasis was placed on}} domestic accidents, airlines, and jet aircraft due principally to availability of information. Only transport category aircraft in commercial service designed under FAR Part 25 were considered. A matrix was prepared to show the relationships between the accident characteristics and the fire fatalities. Typical postcrash fire scenaries were identified. Safety concepts were developed for three engineering categories: cabin interiors - cabin subsystems; power plant - engines and fuel systems; and structural mechanics - primary and secondary structures. The parameters identified for concept evaluation are cost, effectiveness, and societal concerns. Three concepts were selected for design definition and cost and effectiveness analysis: improved fire-resistant seat materials; <b>anti-misting</b> kerosene; and additional cabin emergency exits...|$|E
40|$|The {{ignition}} {{characteristics of}} sprays, created by wind shear action, of Jet-A fuel containing polyisobutylene additives wee examined over ranges of air velocities from 45 to 90 m/s and of fuel/air mass ratios of 0. 20 to 8. 0. Ignition was by calibrated sparks of energies {{up to about}} 0. 5 J and by a butane/oxygen flame at 165 J/s. The polymeric additives studied included the grades L 80, L 160, and L 200 from Exxon Chemical and B 200 and B 230 from BASF. The ignition suppression ability of the additives, {{as well as their}} observed <b>anti-misting</b> (AM) behavior, ranked exactly as their molecular weights (viscosity average, M sub v) with 400 - 500 ppm of L 80 (M sub v = 0. 68 x 1, 000, 000) being required to suppress ignition of a spray at 51 m/s, 1. 8 fuel/air mass ratio, by a 0. 55 J spark while only 10 ppm of B 230 (M sub v = 7. 37 x 1, 000, 000) was required for the same conditions. The additive concentrations (L 160) required for ignition suppression increased with increasing air velocity and with increasing fuel/air ratio...|$|E
