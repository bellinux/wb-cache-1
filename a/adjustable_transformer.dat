25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many <b>adjustable</b> <b>transformer</b> designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{variable-frequency}} transformer behaves as a continuously <b>adjustable</b> phase-shifting <b>transformer.</b> It allows {{control of}} the power flow between two networks. Unlike power electronics solutions such as back-to-back HVDC, the variable frequency transformer does not demand harmonic filters and reactive power compensation. Limitations of the concept are the current-carrying capacity of the slip rings for the rotor winding.|$|R
5000|$|Marconi {{was awarded}} the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun for {{contributions}} to radio sciences. Marconi's demonstrations {{of the use of}} radio for wireless communications, equipping ships with life saving wireless communications, establishing the first transatlantic radio service, and building the first stations for the British shortwave service, have marked his place in history. Shortly {{after the turn of the}} 20th century, the US Patent Office re-awarded Marconi a patent for radio. The [...] was granted on June 4, 1901. Marconi's [...] was awarded on June 11, 1901, also. This system was more advanced than his previous works. The United States Supreme Court, decision of MARCONI WIRELESS T. CO. OF AMERICA v. U.S., 320 U.S. 1 (1943) stated that “Marconi's reputation as the man who first achieved successful radio transmission … is not here in question” this statement is followed by “Marconi's patent involved no invention over Lodge, Tesla, and Stone”. The 1943 decision didn't overturn Marconi's original patents, or his reputation as the first person to develop practical radiotelegraphic communication. It just said that the adoption of <b>adjustable</b> <b>transformers</b> in the transmitting and receiving circuits, which was an improvement of the initial invention, was anticipated by patents issued to Oliver Lodge and John Stone. (This decision wasn't unanimous).|$|R
5000|$|A {{widely used}} design was the Armstrong circuit, {{in which a}} [...] "tickler" [...] coil in the plate circuit was coupled to the tuning coil in the grid circuit, to provide the {{feedback}}. The feedback was controlled by a variable resistor, or alternately by moving the two windings physically closer together to increase loop gain, or apart to reduce it. [...] This was done by an <b>adjustable</b> air core <b>transformer</b> called a variometer (variocoupler). Regenerative detectors were sometimes also used in TRF and superheterodyne receivers.|$|R

40|$|The {{output voltage}} from the {{vertical}} axis wind turbines, build at Uppsala University, varies {{in the sense}} that it increases with the speed of the wind. To get a steady output from these wind turbines a stepless <b>adjustable</b> <b>transformer</b> was constructed. The transformer is cable wound and is adjusted by moving the turns from working with the magnetic field to working against it. With this technique the same cable can be used twice, as a consequence, half the amount of cable is required and the size of the transformer is reduced. The results from the report are that no losses can be connected exclusively to the regulating part of the transformer. No transients of significance occur when the transformer is regulated on load...|$|E
