5|$|On October 13, 1879, a {{post office}} was {{established}} near Hebron Church to serve the adjacent community (then known as Mutton Run). In December 1884, the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue, burning <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the sanctuary's ceiling which was soon repaired. On August 11â€“15, 1886, Hebron Church celebrated its centennial. During the celebration, Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region. The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States.|$|E
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Amiens {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed {{movement}} on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third Army with no armoured support had almost no effect on the line while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. Australian commander John Monash was knighted by King George V in the days following the battle.|$|E

5|$|The French {{military}} invaded Antananarivo in September 1894, {{prompting the}} queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> a {{building at the}} Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo, walkways and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive. They chose Antaninarenina as {{the site for the}} French Governor General's Residency; upon independence it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure were introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs {{at the foot of the}} hill, was brought from the Ikopa River.|$|E
5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

5|$|The {{cessation}} of diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar prompted immediate French {{military action in}} a campaign that {{became known as the}} Second Franco-Hova War. The expedition ended eleven months later in September 1895 when a French military column reached Antananarivo and bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, blasting <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the roof of the queen's quarters and inflicting heavy casualties among the numerous courtiers gathered in the palace courtyard. Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. Forty-five minutes later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted. The following day Queen Ranavalona signed a treaty accepting the French protectorate over Madagascar. She and her court were permitted to remain at the palace and administer the country according to French dictates.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment, but only one shell did any significant damage. It hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> which water flooded in. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and the ship's captain decided to head for the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. Escorted by Charlemagne in case she foundered en route, Gaulois managed to reach the islands. After temporary repairs, the ship was refloated and sailed for Toulon, escorted by Suffren. They encountered heavy weather en route and emergency repairs had {{to be made in the}} Bay of Navarin. She made Toulon without further incident where the ship was refitted and extensively modified to improve her stability, returning to the Dardanelles in July.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E

25|$|A {{knockout}} punch, {{also known}} as a chassis punch, panel punch, Greenlee punch, or a Q-max, is a hand tool used to punch <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> sheet metal. It is a very simple tool that consists of a punch, die, and screw. There are three different drive systems: manual, ratchet, and hydraulic.|$|E
25|$|The spindle, carved {{to reduce}} {{friction}} {{at one end}} and maximize it at the other, is held in a hole {{in the bottom of the}} bearing block, and at the other by the base board (which also is known variously as the hearth, hearth board, or fireboard). The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is tight enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this is called the Egyptian Bow Drill. It attaches the string by wrapping it around multiple times, or actually tying it to the drill or through <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the drill shaft, then wrapping it.|$|E
25|$|At Kutna Hora in {{the early}} winter of 1421, the Taborites were encircled by the {{superior}} forces of the Holy Roman Empire under King Sigismund. Even though Sigismund's elite heavy cavalry was kept at bay by Zizka's artillery, the Taborites apparently faced imminent destruction. However, on 21 December, Zizka grouped his war wagons into a column and charged the enemy lines. The battle wagons advanced rapidly, with all of their guns blazing. The column smashed <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> Sigismund's line, allowing the Taborites to escape the encirclement. Sigismund decided against mounting a pursuit of the Hussites, for he incorrectly believed {{that they had been}} utterly defeated.|$|E

25|$|TEPCO {{estimates}} the nuclear fuel {{was exposed to}} the air less than five hours after the earthquake struck. Fuel rods melted away rapidly as the temperature inside the core reached 2,800Â°C within six hours. In less than 16hours, the reactor core melted and dropped {{to the bottom of}} the pressure vessel, burning <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the vessel. By that time, water was pumped into the reactor in an effort to prevent the worst-case scenario â€“ overheating fuel melting its way through the containment and discharging large amounts of radionuclides in the environment. In June the Japanese government confirmed that Unit 1 reactor vessel containment was breached, and pumped cooling water continues to leak months after the disaster.|$|E
25|$|The 51st Battalion {{attempted}} another {{takeover of}} the fort on October 21â€“22. After an artillery and aircraft barrage at 18:00, the Givati forces made their assault, employing a rigged armored vehicle which was meant to blow <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the fort's walls. It got trapped between the barbed wire fences, but its explosion destroyed them and allowed the infantry to advanced onto the fort itself. Four soldiers managed to infiltrate it, but were overwhelmed by Egyptian fire and withdrew. The final battle of the corridor in Operation Yoav also came {{on the night of}} October 21â€“22, when Givati's 53rd Battalion made an attempts at the Egyptian Burma Road, failing to take any positions and retreating.|$|E
25|$|Eighty-seven {{people died}} in the {{resulting}} fire. Nineteen bodies were found downstairs; the others upstairs. Six bodies were found within several feet of the front door. Some of those trapped punched <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> a wall to an adjoining union hall in an attempt to escape. Most of the deaths were from asphyxiation or due to having been trampled. Most of the victims were young Hondurans celebrating Carnival, largely drawn from members of the local Garifuna American community. The fire was the deadliest in New York City since the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, and the deadliest in the United States since the Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto Rico in 1986.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>through</b> <b>hole,</b> also {{thru-hole}} or clearance <b>hole,</b> {{refers to}} <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> that is reamed, drilled, milled etc., completely through {{the material of}} an object. In other words, <b>a</b> <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> is <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> that {{goes all the way}} through something. This is to distinguish it from <b>a</b> blind <b>hole,</b> which does not go {{all the way through the}} material of the object.|$|R
25|$|Before being depowered, the Blob's mutant {{physiology}} granted him {{a number}} of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin proved {{to be difficult to}} penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even Wolverine's claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate his flesh. For instance, the Blob once sat on the X-Man, but jumped off in pain when Wolverine extended his sheathed claws into the Blob's rear. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both Black Raazer and the Arabian Knight were able to harm him.|$|E
25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as a flywheel, and a length of cord. The weight is attached {{near the bottom of the}} shaft and the hole board is slipped over the top. The cordage is run through a hole near the top of the shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a square hole made to fit certain sized auger bits or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} common object was a stone star with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the middle. They were found {{everywhere}} between Ibarra and Riobamba. The majority have six rays (and none have more), proceeding symmetrically from the center, and the whole are fashioned alike upon each side. A certain number have only five rays, and occasional examples are irregular in shape. All are pierced by a hole, which has been drilled from the two sides, {{and the size of}} this varies considerably. In dimensions they range from three to five inches in diameter and from three-quarters of an inch to two inches in thickness. Their weight is from five to twenty ounces. The larger part are made from basaltic rock and gabbro. Objects of this class were also cast in metal but these are now rarely found in Ecuador.|$|E
