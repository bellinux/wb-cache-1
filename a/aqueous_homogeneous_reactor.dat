5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{designed}} an <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor</b> {{in which}} enriched uranium {{in the form}} of soluble uranium sulfate, was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a beryllium oxide neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|E
50|$|Uranyl nitrate {{was used}} to fuel <b>Aqueous</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactors</b> in the 1950s as an {{alternative}} to the more corrosive uranyl sulfate. However, research focus was on heterogeneous reactor designs and the experiments were abandoned.|$|R

This report includes tables, and illustrations...|$|R
50|$|<b>Aqueous</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactors</b> (AHRs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a fluid fueled design that could accept naturally occurring uranium and thorium suspended in a heavy water solution. AHRs have been built {{and according to the}} IAEA reactor database, 7 are currently in operation as research reactors.|$|R
5|$|The Water Boiler was an <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is {{dissolved}} in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water Boiler did take up an inordinate amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water Boiler.|$|E
5|$|The French {{scientists}} {{made good}} {{progress on the}} design of an <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor,</b> but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British Tube Alloys project, that of building an atomic bomb, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed plutonium, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. It made sense to pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using deuterium as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the production and use of plutonium. George Thomson, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
25|$|The fusion {{cross section}} {{calculations}} were finished by September 1943, and the Purdue group {{moved to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory, where most of them, including Holloway, worked on the Water Boiler, an <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor</b> that was intended {{for use as a}} laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials. The Water Boiler group was headed by Donald W. Kerst from the University of Illinois, and the group designed and built the Water Boiler, which achieved its criticality in May 1944 under the control of Enrico Fermi, after one final addition of uranium enriched to 14% uranium 235. It was world third reactor but the first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel, using most of the world's supply at the time, and the first to use liquid nuclear fuel in the form of soluble uranium sulfate dissolved in water.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> (AHRs) use a {{solution}} of uranyl sulfate or other uranium salt in water. Historically, AHRs have all been small research reactors, not large power reactors. An AHR known as the Medical Isotope Production System is being considered for production of medical isotopes.|$|R

500|$|Weinberg {{replaced}} Wigner as Director of Research at ORNL in 1948, {{and became}} {{director of the}} laboratory in 1955. [...] Under his direction it worked on the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program, and pioneered many innovative reactor designs, including the pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), which have since become the dominant reactor types in commercial nuclear power plants, and <b>Aqueous</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactor</b> designs.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg had the Materials Testing Reactor {{converted}} into a mock-up of a real reactor called the Low Intensity Test Reactor (LITR) or [...] "Poor Man's Pile". Experiments at the LITR led {{to the design of}} both pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), which have since become the dominant reactor types in commercial nuclear power plants. Weinberg was attracted to the simplicity and self-controlling features of nuclear reactors that used fluid fuels, such as Harold Urey and Eugene Wigner's proposed <b>Aqueous</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactor.</b> Therefore, to support the Nuclear Aircraft project in the late 1940s, Weinberg asked ORNL's reactor engineers to design a reactor using liquid instead of solid fuel.|$|E
500|$|From 1942 to 1943, Schreiber was a {{researcher}} with the Purdue Research Foundation. He participated in early {{work for the}} Manhattan Project there using the university's cyclotron. In 1943, he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory, and moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico {{with his wife and}} 16-month-old daughter. At Los Alamos, he worked on the Water Boiler, an <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactor.</b> The Water Boiler group was headed by Donald W.

5000|$|<b>Aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> (AHR) are a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which soluble nuclear salts (usually uranium sulfate or uranium nitrate) are {{dissolved}} in water.

50|$|Uranium sulfate (U(SO4)2) is a {{water-soluble}} salt of uranium. It is a {{very toxic}} compound. Uranium sulfate minerals commonly are widespread around uranium bearing mine sites, where they usually form during the evaporation of acid sulfate-rich mine tailings which have been leached by oxygen-bearing waters. Uranium sulfate is a transitional compound {{in the production of}} Uranium hexafluoride. It was also used to fuel <b>aqueous</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Reactors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> were {{sometimes}} called [...] "water boilers" [...] (not {{to be confused}} with boiling water reactors), as the water inside seems to boil, but in fact this bubbling is due to the production of hydrogen and oxygen as radiation and fission particles dissociate the water into its constituent gases, a process called radiolysis. AHRs were widely used as research reactors as they are self-controlling, have very high neutron fluxes, and were easy to manage. As of April 2006, only five AHRs were operating according to the Research Reactor database.|$|R

40|$|The United States consumes {{almost half}} of all medical {{isotopes}} produced worldwide, and relies on foreign sources for nearly its entire supply. These isotopes are produced in nuclear reactors which are very costly to construct. A domestic supply may be realized if research reactors at universities and national laboratories can be enhanced with isotope production capabilities. This re-search is dedicated to the design of an aqueous target system that can be appended to exiting re-search reactors for this purpose. The design aims to combine attributes of solid target irradiation by conventional reactors and in-solution production by <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> in order to realize some of the benefits of each method. The benefits for the former include using existing reactors as the external neutron source hence reducing the investment capital significantly. The benefits for <b>aqueous</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>reactors</b> are numerous and include higher efficiency, substantial reduction in waste, lower fuel cost, and reduced isotope separation complexity. Utilizing a flowing fuel design will enable continuous isotope separation and more efficient heat removal, as well as eliminate some of the complications that have plagued solution fueled reactors in the past such as power oscillations and fuel precipitation. The aqueous target system described in this thesis is designed for the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) at Sandia National Laboratories. The system is optimized for 99 Mo production, as this is the medical isotope in highest demand and used in a majority of all medical diagnostic procedures excluding x-ray imaging. The optimized production rate is calculated to be 3044 Ci 6 -day per week which accounts for 50. 7 % of domestic consumption...|$|R

The numerical simulations of an AHR model were carried out using the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code ANSYS CFX 14. Evaluation shows that the ARGUS heat removal systems working at 75 [*]kWth are not able to provide sufficient cooling capacity to prevent fuel solution overheating.
