40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{conducting}} purity analysis of Kentucky bluegrass seed were compared. They were: (1) hand method-preliminary separation made with <b>a</b> <b>blower</b> {{and the final}} differentiation of questionable florets by hand, (2) standard method-separation with <b>a</b> <b>blower</b> using the same pure seed criteria as for the hand method and (3) climax method-separation with <b>a</b> <b>blower</b> at <b>a</b> level which gives the maximum pure live seed percentage. Three blowers (the Ottawa, Erickson and Ames) {{were included in the}} study. Four laboratories cooperated in the investigation. Variations within laboratories were compared; variations between laboratories were not considered...|$|R

40|$|Air cycle {{heat pump}} has large {{potentials}} in heating applications. However, a key challenge faced nowadays is the matching problem between its expander and compressor. This paper presents the performance evaluation {{of an air}} cycle heat pump system integrated with <b>a</b> turbocharger, <b>a</b> <b>blower</b> and <b>a</b> regenerated heat exchanger. A thermodynamic model for this system is first developed and {{the relationships between the}} system performance and the operating parameters are investigated. Then, the performance of three different air cycle heat pumps with <b>a</b> <b>blower</b> installed before the compressor, and <b>a</b> <b>blower</b> installed before the turbine, and with an expander, are numerically simulated. The results indicated that the blower installed before the compressor can achieve a higher heating capacity and thus a higher COP. Finally, the heating power consumption of air cycle heat pump was compared with the PTC and the vapor compression heat pump of the full electric vehicle...|$|R

Magnetic equivalent circuit model and finite element analysis are used to design the motor, and an improved structure is considered to reduce a mechanical loss induced from bearing units. Finally, air blower system combined with the motor and an impeller is manufactured and output properties, such as an air pressure and an amount of flowing air, are measured. Through the experimental results, a validity of the simulated one is confirmed. Keywords—Fuel cell modules, BLDC motor, Impeller, Air management...|$|R
