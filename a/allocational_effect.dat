40|$|This paper uses an {{equilibrium}} matching {{framework to}} study jointly the optimal private provision of severance pay and the allocational and welfare consequences of government intervention {{in excess of}} private arrangements. Firms insure riskaverse workers by means of simple explicit employment contracts. Contracts can be renegotiated ex post by mutual consent. It is shown that the lower bound on the privately optimal severance payment equals the fall in lifetime wealth associated with job loss. Simulations show that, despite contract incompleteness, legislated dismissal costs largely in excess of such private optimum are effectively undone by renegotiation and have only a small <b>allocational</b> <b>effect.</b> Welfare falls. Yet, for deviations from laissez faire in line with those observed for most OECD countries, the welfare loss is small. Severance Pay, Contracts, Renegotiation...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effects on credit {{allocation}} and bank stability of introducing a leverage ratio requirement (LRR) on top of risk-based capital requirements, as in Basel III. For the current 3 % LRR, both low-risk and high-risk loan rates and volumes remain essentially unchanged, because banks previously specializing in low-risk lending can adapt by granting both low-risk and high-risk loans. For sufficiently high LRRs, low-risk lending rates would significantly increase and high-risk lending rates would fall. In the presence of severe ‘model risk’ concerning low-risk loans, as happened in the subprime crisis, the current 3 % LRR might even reduce bank stability, counter to regulatory intentions. This is because the <b>allocational</b> <b>effect</b> caused by the LRR, which makes bank loan portfolios more alike, may turn beneficial risk spreading into harmful risk contamination. For higher levels of LRR, however, bank stability {{is likely to be}} improved even in the presence of model risk. bank regulation; Basel III; capital requirements; credit risk; leverage ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{resource}} boom {{effect and}} the input price effect of raw material price changes are analyzed within a two-period, two-sector (plus resource industry), open economy framework. Diagrammatic exposition {{is used to}} study the 'Dutch disease', {{and in particular the}} distinction between the short term wealth effects (causing a real appreciation and a movement of variable factors from tradable to non-tradable industries) and between the long-run effects on total investment, its sectoral allocation and its finance by foreign borrowing. The framework further enables analysis of the different <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> of temporary versus permanent raw material price increases, when the two sectors differ in material use. Also discussed are the effects of changes in the world interest rate on factor allocation and foreign borrowing as well as the <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> of government intervention in the case of temporary real wage rigidity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{undertaken}} in Hong Kong, addressing the way that resources are deployed in grammer schools to provide a curriculum for sixth-form students. The crucial resources in this analysis is time. An analytical technique that allows modelling of the <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> of alternative educational decisions is used. This technique also permits the direction and magnitude of cross-subsidizational flows among school activities to be identified. The results of this analysis and their implications for Hong Kong schooling are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} both distributional and <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> {{of limiting}} {{carbon dioxide emissions}} in a small and open economy. It starts from the assumption that Switzerland attempts to stabilize its greenhouse gas emissions over the next 25 years, and evaluates {{costs and benefits of}} the respective reduction program. From a methodological viewpoint, this paper illustrates, how a computable general equilibrium approach can be adopted for identifying economic effects of cutting greenhouse gas emissions on the national level. From a political economy point of view it considers the social incidence of a greenhouse policy. It shows in particular that public acceptance can be increased and economic costs of greenhouse policies can be reduced, if carbon taxes are accompanied by revenue redistribution.

40|$|Although {{beneficial}} <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been}} a central motivation for the Basel II capital adequacy reform, the interaction of these effects with Basel II’s procyclical impact has been less discussed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Basel II on the efficiency of bank lending. We consider competitive credit markets where entrepreneurs may apply for loans for investments of different risk profiles. In this setting, excessive risk taking typically arises because low risk borrowers cross-subsidize high risk borrowers through the price system {{that is based on}} average success rates. We find that while flat-rate capital requirements (such as Basel I) amplify overinvestment in risky projects, risk-based capital requirements alleviate the cross-subsidization <b>effect,</b> improving <b>allocational</b> efficiency. This also suggests that Basel II does not necessarily lead to exacerbation of macroeconomic cycles because the reduction in the proportion of high-risk investments softens the cyclicality of bank lending over the business cycle.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> and {{implications}} for efficiency of a tax {{system in which the}} rate of tax on capital income differs depending on the recipient of the income and on the type of capital producing the income. It suggests that, in their attempts to measure the distortionary effect of the U. S. capital income tax system, economists may have been looking in the wrong places. In the presence of uncertainty, the intersectoral distortion may be much less than had previously been imagined. However, the tax system distorts at two other margins which have not received much attention. It distorts the inter-household allocation of the housing stock, since the after-tax rate of interest is one component of the opportunity cost of owner-occupied housing. It also distorts the inter-household allocation of risk-bearing. Calculations using a simple commutable general equilibrium model suggest that the excess burden from these latter two distortions are significant components of the total distortionary impact of the tax system. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{beneficial}} <b>allocational</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been}} a central motivator for the Basel II capital adequacy reform, the interaction of these effects with Basel II’s procyclical impact has been less discussed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of capital requirements on the allocation of credit and its interaction with procyclicality, and compare Basel I and Basel II type capital requirements. We consider competitive credit markets where entrepreneurs of varying ability can apply for loans for one-period investment projects of two different risk types. The risk of a project further depends {{on the state of}} the economy, modelled as a two-state Markov process. In this type of setting, excessive risk taking typically arises because higher-type borrowers cross-subsidize lower-type borrowers via a pricing regime based on average success rates. We find that risk-based capital requirements (such as Basel II) alleviate the cross-subsidization effect and can be chosen so as to implement first-best allocation. This implies that the ensuing reduction in the proportion of high-risk investments may mitigate the procyclical effect of Basel II on economic activity. Moreover, we find that optimal risk-based capital requirements should be set lower in recessions than in normal times. Our simulations show that when measured by either cumulative output or output variation, Basel II type capital requirements may actual be slightly less procyclical than flat capital requirements. The biggest reduction in procyclicality is however achieved with optimal risk-based capital requirements which are considerably higher than Basel II requirements and which are adjusted downwards in recession periods.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is primarily}} concerned with evaluating the welfare implications of the National Energy Program (NEP) for Canada in static, partial- and general-equilibrium frameworks. Foreign participation in the Canadian economy is incorporated in analyzing the <b>allocational</b> and distributional <b>effects</b> of these petroleum pricing and fiscal policies.;The international redistribution of crude oil rents as well as efficiency and intranational revenue redistribution effects of both NEP pricing and fiscal policies on the Canadian crude oil market are addressed in partial equilibrium analyses.;A unique and relatively simple approach to general-equilibrium modelling (developed in association with John Whalley) is {{used to analyze the}} welfare effects of the NEP petroleum pricing policies. The basic model uses the assumption that Canada is a taker of commodity prices on world markets in solving the zero profit conditions to determine cost covering factor prices from given world goods prices. Full employment conditions for factors then determine industry production levels. Once domestic demands are calculated, excess demands for goods are obtained as a residual. The basic approach allows for further complicating structural elements such as foreign participation, price controls, taxes and non-traded goods to be introduced as required.;The NEP pricing and fiscal policies resulted in overconsumption and underproduction of petroleum in Canada compared to the levels of consumption and production that would have resulted from market-determined petroleum pricing {{and in the absence of}} the NEP fiscal policies. While allocational inefficiencies reflect a Canadian welfare loss, petroleum rents were also redistributed between foreigners and Canadians. The empirical results suggest that the transfer of rents from foreign producers to Canadians, reflected in a Canadian welfare gain, was not insignificant; indeed, it is found to have dominated the efficiency losses in consumption and production.;A procedure is also developed for calculating compensating and equivalent variation from market demand information. As a corollary to this latter work, it is shown that, under certain conditions, a partial-equilibrium analysis employing consumer 2 ̆ 7 s and producer 2 ̆ 7 s surpluses is capable of yielding as valid a representation of welfare change (i. e., compensating variation) as that achieved using the general-equilibrium modelling technique...|$|R
