2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work {{was a critical}} factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations. [...] Early projects used reciprocating steam engines, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the steam turbine fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution; making parallel operation of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses. [...] Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the <b>allowable</b> <b>speed</b> of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no [...] gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service.|$|E
50|$|The Höllentalbahn {{operates}} on a 550 Volt system. Its track has a minimum radius of 60 metres, {{and a maximum}} gradient of 2.5% (1:40). Maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>speed</b> on the railway is 25 km/h.|$|E
50|$|There may be {{restriction}} in maximum operating speeds due {{to track}} geometry of existing line, especially on curves. Straightening the route, where possible, {{will reduce the}} travel time by increasing the <b>allowable</b> <b>speeds</b> and by reducing the length of track. When straight routes are not possible, {{reducing the number of}} curves and lowering the degree of curvature would result in higher <b>allowable</b> <b>speeds</b> on those curves. An example is the elimination of three consecutive reverse curves in favor of one larger curve. Raising superelevation may be considered for sharp curves which significantly limit speed. The higher speeds on those modified curves, together with the higher superelevation, will require track modification to have transition spirals to and from those curves to be longer.|$|R

For example, on high speed lines where the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>speed</b> is 300 km/h (186 mph), a different network code is used from that in the Channel Tunnel, where the speed limit is 160 km/h (100 mph). Eurostar trains need this information since they operate both on high speed tracks and in the tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} single {{instrument is}} the [...] "maximum allowable airspeed indicator." [...] It has a movable pointer that indicates the maximum operating limit (Vmo or Mmo).

As the aircraft climbs to high altitude, such that MMO rather than VMO becomes the limiting speed, the barber pole moves to lower IAS values.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{improvements}} in the 1960s led to the Indusi I 60 system. When a 1000 Hz inductor was encountered, the driver had to acknowledge the caution signal within four seconds. Additionally, a countdown was started to check whether the train had slowed to a specified speed within a specified time frame. Depending {{on the type of}} train the locomotive was hauling, the system could be manually switched between three modes of operation: freight train, low speed and high speed passenger train.

40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} of vehicles and bridges results in live loads being induced into bridges that {{are greater than}} the vehicle’s static weight. To limit this dynamic effect, the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) currently requires that permitted trucks slow to five miles per hour and span the roadway centerline when crossing bridges. However, this practice has other negative consequences such as the potential for crashes, impracticality for bridges with high traffic volumes, and higher fuel consumption. The main objective of this work was to provide information and guidance on the <b>allowable</b> <b>speeds</b> for permitted vehicles and loads on bridges. A field test program was implemented on five bridges (i. e., two steel girder bridges, two pre-stressed concrete girder bridges, and one concrete slab bridge) to investigate the dynamic response of bridges due to vehicle loadings. The important factors taken into account during the field tests included vehicle speed, entrance conditions, vehicle characteristics (i. e., empty dump truck, full dump truck, and semi-truck), and bridge geometric characteristics (i. e., long span and short span). Three entrance conditions were used: As-is and also Level 1 and Level 2, which simulated rough entrance conditions with a fabricated ramp placed 10 feet from the joint between the bridge end and approach slab and directly next to the joint, respectively. The researchers analyzed and utilized the field data to derive the dynamic impact factors (DIFs) for all gauges installed on each bridge under the different loading scenarios...|$|R

ODOT did not raise speed limits beyond 65 mph on other freeways, and strongly opposed legislative efforts to raise the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>speed</b> limit. However, in July 2015, Governor Kate Brown signed a bill raising speed limits on several highways in eastern Oregon; the bill included provisions to raise the speed limit to 70 mph on I-84 and US 95.|$|E

All mainline signals have two signal 'heads' (originally upper quadrant semaphore arms but now colour light, LED or searchlight), both are always lit. The aspects shown depend on the <b>allowable</b> <b>speed</b> for the route set. If the route was for Normal speed, the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the top head, if the move is for Medium speed (35 km/h, such as when entering a loop or siding), the 'proceed' component of the indication is conveyed by the lower head.
