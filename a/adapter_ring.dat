The observatory attaches to the Ariane 5 rocket via a launch vehicle <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> {{which could be used}} by a future spacecraft to grapple the observatory to attempt to fix gross deployment problems. However, the telescope itself is not serviceable, and astronauts {{would not be able to}} perform tasks such as swapping instruments, as with the Hubble Telescope. Its nominal mission time is five years, with a goal of ten years. JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around L2, which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime, and it is being designed to carry enough for ten years. The planned five year science mission begins after a 6-month commissioning phase. An L2 orbit is meta-stable so it requires orbital station-keeping or an object will drift away from this orbital configuration.|$|E

50|$|A trickle ring is a {{circular}} drip irrigation device which evenly distributes water {{around the base}} of a tree or shrub. Connected to a water supply by a garden hose or tubing <b>adapter</b> fitting, trickle <b>rings</b> may be integrated into an irrigation network which waters many plants at the same time. By regulating the flow of water through the trickle ring, soil can be saturated at a rate which conserves water by minimizing wasteful surface runoff and losses due to evaporation.|$|R
50|$|An <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> has {{a female}} M42×0.75 metric thread {{on one side}} and a {{corresponding}} lens mount of the camera body on the other side. A T-adapter consists of an inner ring with T-mount thread and an external ring with corresponding lens mount. The T-ring and the T-2 ring are identical to each other. Both of them have the inner and outer ring. The two rings (inner and outer) are held together by 3 peripheral screws on the external ring. Loosening these screws allows rotation between the lens and the camera body. This is especially useful when the camera body is attached to telescopes or microscopes.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Epson {{introduced}} their R-D1 digital RangeFinder Camera, {{which supports}} Leica M mount and Leica screw mount lenses with an <b>adapter</b> <b>ring.</b> This camera {{is the first}} digital rangefinder on the market.

As of 2006 the R-D1 has been replaced by the R-D1s. The R-D1s is less expensive but its hardware is identical. Epson has released a firmware patch to bring the R-D1 up to the full functionality of its successor—the first digital camera manufacturer to make such an upgrade available for free.|$|E

40|$|The SA 1358 - 10 and SA 2052 - 4 {{circular}} JT Type plug connectors {{are used}} {{on a number of}} nuclear weapons and Joint Test Assembly (JTA) systems. Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) spring fingers to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> to the connector shell (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the <b>adapter</b> <b>ring)</b> that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the spring finger solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the spring finger solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the spring finger solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the <b>adapter</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|E

50|$|The LCROSS mission took {{advantage}} of the structural capabilities of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload <b>Adapter</b> (ESPA) <b>ring</b> used to attach LRO to the Centaur upper-stage rocket. Mounted {{on the outside of the}} ESPA were six panels that hold the spacecraft's science payload, command and control systems, communications equipment, batteries, and solar panels. A small monopropellant propulsion system was mounted inside of the ring. Also attached were two S Band omnidirectional antennas and two medium-gain antennas. The mission's strict schedule, mass, and budget constraints posed difficult challenges to engineering teams from NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and Northrop Grumman. Their creative thinking led to a unique use of the ESPA ring and innovative sourcing of other spacecraft components. Usually, the ESPA ring is used as a platform to hold six small deployable satellites; for LCROSS, it became the backbone of the satellite, a first for the ring. LCROSS also {{took advantage}} of commercially available instruments and used many of the already-flight-verified components used on LRO.|$|R
40|$|STPSat- 1 was {{launched}} on March 8, 2007, into a 560 km orbit {{as one of}} the payloads on the maiden flight of the EELV Secondary Payload <b>Adapter</b> (ESPA) <b>ring.</b> This Class “C”, single-string satellite with a prelaunch calculated reliability less than 0. 75 is currently on orbit and exceeding the per-orbit data collection requirements of the two active experiments onboard: the Spatial Heterodyne Imager for Mesospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) and the Computerized Ionospheric Tomography Receiver in Space (CITRIS).

By staying ahead of the competition, space systems can offer unique battlefield capabilities. A number of space programs are increasingly behind schedule, over budget, and underperforming. This thesis explains the benefits the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload <b>Adapter</b> (ESPA) <b>ring</b> can offer programs experiencing technical immaturity or desiring responsive space. By understanding and adhering to the ESPA Rideshare Users Guide and the Auxiliary Payload Interface Control Document, programs desiring a ride aboard an ESPA-configured EELV will achieve greater success and have fewer issues in the launch vehicle-to-satellite integration process. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published many reports offering proven process requirements {{that will result in}} increasing the odds of program success. By studying the benefits an ESPA ring offers, many processes recommended by the GAO can be implemented resulting in better cost and schedule performance. The research performed involves launch vehicles and their current state, along with a description of rideshare integration. The analytical results, along with findings of successful and struggling space programs, are then used to show how the ESPA system can advance program readiness from the laboratory to the operational environment...|$|R
30|$|Based on the converged spectra {{resonance}} frequencies for probes {{with different}} probe radii can be determined, {{which are in}} good agreement with former CST simulations [29]. As proposed in this reference probes with different probe radii {{should be used to}} cover different frequency ranges. Within these frequency ranges the analytically determined resonance frequencies in this mansuscript are larger than that from the simulations. This is caused by a metallic <b>adapter</b> <b>ring,</b> which serves as planar impedance matching in the pMRP design. First simulations show, that a decrease of the inner radius of this ring shifts the resonances to larger frequencies, which leads to a better agreement with the analytic model.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to anchor thermal and fluid system models to CRYOTE ground test data. The CRYOTE ground test artide was jointly {{developed}} by Innovative Engineering Solutions, United Launch Alliance and NASA KSC. The test article was constructed out of a titanium alloy tank, Sapphire 77 composite skin (similar to G 10), an external secondary payload <b>adapter</b> <b>ring,</b> thermal vent system, multi layer insulation and various data acquisition instrumentation. In efforts to understand heat loads throughout this system, the GTA (filled with liquid nitrogen for safety purposes) was subjected to a series of tests in a vacuum chamber at Marshall Space Flight Center. By anchoring analytical models against test data, higher fidelity thermal environment predictions can be made for future flight articles which would eventually demonstrate critical cryogenic fluid management technologies such as system chilldown, transfer, pressure control and long term storage. Significant factors that influenced heat loads included radiative environments, multi-layer insulation performance, tank fill levels and pressures and even contact conductance coefficients.

There is a solution; {{we can avoid}} many of the latencies associated with satellite manufacture and launch by developing and building Satellite Carriers (SatCarriers). The basic function of a SatCarrier system will be to provide on-orbit storage of small satellites. SatCarriers will loiter in Earth orbits carrying squadrons of small satellite. The satellites resident on these SatCarriers {{will be ready to}} deploy on demand. SatCarrier capabilities will fall between Tier 1 and Tier 2 as defined by the Operationally Responsive Space Plan submitted by the Department of Defense to Congress on 20 Apr 2007.
