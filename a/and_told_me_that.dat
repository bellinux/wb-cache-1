Robert Oppenheimer {{began working}} on the nuclear weapon design for the Manhattan Project during World War II, Lawrence loaned Greene {{part-time}} to take dictation and do general secretarial work for Oppenheimer, while still working full-time for himself. [...] "When Robert returned from travel <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he had just been}} to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'" [...] she later recalled. Lawrence reluctantly let her go. She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.|$|E

During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> [...] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi {{had told her that}} he wanted to sleep for {{a day and a half}} before he went to America. She told me that he did not intend to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Faced with a {{mortgage}} and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation {{as a result}} of his 1969 divorce, he began to support himself largely by giving college lectures and appearances at science fiction conventions. [...] According to Arthur C. Clarke, [...] "After attending , Gene introduced himself <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his series was being cancelled because the television executives, in their inscrutable wisdom, had decided that there was no audience for it. Poor Gene was broke and about to mortgage his home. I introduced him to my lecture agent, who was skeptical but booked him into a small hall -- which couldn't hold the audience he attracted." [...] Although the geographical distance imposed by Clarke's residence in Sri Lanka resulted in only a handful of physical meetings, Roddenberry would later characterize their friendship as [...] "the most significant of my professional life.” ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} claimed {{for many years}} as {{the origin of the}} Prester John legend, but most modern experts believe that the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion that it had been {{projected}} upon Ong Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century. Modern scholars find nothing about the Prester or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any place else, and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated that the story was not widely known there until well after European contact. Czech Franciscan Remedius Prutky asked Emperor Iyasu II about this identification in 1751, and Prutky states that the man was [...] "astonished, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name." [...] In a footnote to this passage, Richard Pankhurst states that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely unaware of the title until Prutky's inquiry.|$|E

500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it was top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

In {{the midst of this}} talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.
