60|$|In {{order to}} carry on general reasonings {{on the subject of}} Functions, we require a {{nomenclature}} enabling us to express any two numbers by names which, without specifying what particular numbers they are, shall show what function each is of the other; or, in other words, shall put in evidence their mode of formation from one another. The system of general language called <b>algebraical</b> <b>notation</b> does this. The expressions a and a2+3a denote, the one any number, the other the number formed from it in a particular manner. The expressions a, b, n, and (a+b)n, denote any three numbers, and a fourth which is formed from them in a certain mode.|$|E
