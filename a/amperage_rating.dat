40|$|Three-phase motors {{use more}} than half of all {{electricity}} in the United States. Energy efficient models are available in most motor classes in the 1 to 500 horsepower range, offering simple pay backs under two years. In practice, few motor buyers have performed an economic analysis, resulting in missed energy and dollar savings. MotorMaster software helps identify the best motor for a specific application. Its database of 9, 000 motors includes the majority of three-phase motors sold in the United State. Performance information such as Full-Load RPM, torque and <b>amperage</b> <b>rating</b> identify models that meet specific design criteria. MotorMaster calculates operating costs and simple paybacks. This paper reviews the importance of proper electric motor selection and explains how MotorMaster software can be used to identify the most efficient, cost effective and reliable motor for each specific application...|$|E
40|$|Ground faults in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems pose a {{fire and}} shock hazard. To mitigate these risks, AC-isolated, DC grounded PV systems in the United States use Ground Fault Protection Devices (GFPDs), e. g., fuses, to de-energize the PV system {{when there is a}} ground fault. Recently the effectiveness of these protection devices has come under question because multiple fires have started when ground faults went undetected. In order to understand the limitations of fuse-based ground fault protection in PV systems, analytical and numerical simulations of different ground faults were performed. The numerical simulations were conducted with Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) using a circuit model of the PV system which included the modules, wiring, switchgear, grounded or ungrounded components, and the inverter. The derivation of the SPICE model and the results of parametric fault current studies are provided with varying array topologies, fuse sizes, and fault impedances. Closed-form analytical approximations for GFPD currents from faults to the grounded current carrying conductor-known as %E 2 % 80 % 9 Cblind spot%E 2 % 80 % 9 D ground faults-are derived to provide greater understanding of the influence of array impedances on fault currents. The behavior of the array during various ground faults is studied for a range of ground fault fuse sizes to determine if reducing the size of the fuse improves ground fault detection sensitivity. The results of the simulations show that reducing the <b>amperage</b> <b>rating</b> of the protective fuse does increase fault current detection sensitivity without increasing the likelihood of nuisance trips to a degree. Unfortunately, this benefit reaches a limit as fuses become smaller and their internal resistance increases to the point of becoming a major element in the fault current circuit...|$|E
