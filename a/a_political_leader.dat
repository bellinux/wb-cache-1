5|$|King {{decided to}} appoint two {{additional}} ministers, one {{in charge of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force, the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy. He therefore, asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services. Macdonald, who had fought in World War I as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium, decided it was his duty to fight World War II as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{five years}} in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive {{increase}} in Canada's naval forces and {{played a key role}} in a political crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> whom Macdonald grew to loathe. When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.|$|E

5|$|One {{night during}} {{preparations}} for the expedition, the hermai, heads of the god Hermes on a plinth with a phallus, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and {{was seen as a}} bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader,</b> used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, Cimon's son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.|$|E

25|$|In these circumstances, {{reciprocal}} exchange can {{be divided}} in two types: dyadic back-and-forth exchange (reciprocity), and pooling (redistribution). Pooling is a system of reciprocities. It is a within group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a between relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests. While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, {{it is also the}} basis for sustained community efforts under <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|E

25|$|De Valera was a {{commander}} in the 1916 Easter Rising, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> in the War of Independence and of the anti-Treaty opposition in the ensuing Irish Civil War (1922–1923). After leaving Sinn Féin in 1926 due to its policy of abstentionism, he founded Fianna Fáil, and was head of government (President of the Executive Council, later Taoiseach) from 1932 to 1948, 1951 to 1954, and 1957 to 1959, when he resigned after being elected as President of Ireland. His political creed evolved from militant republicanism to social and cultural conservatism.|$|E
25|$|The King is {{not only}} <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader,</b> but also holds the title “Commander of the Faithful,” {{indicating}} {{his role as a}} religious leader as well. The royal family of Morocco, which claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad, therefore enjoys a sense of political legitimacy rooted in Islam and also has the power to dictate the form that Islam takes within Moroccan society. As a result, this traditional form of religious authority gives the monarch the political legitimacy to arbitrate the agenda and decisions of a modern, multiparty government.|$|E
25|$|The borough {{had some}} {{distinguished}} {{representatives in the}} 19th century.

The Marquess of Granby had little to commend himself as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader,</b> apart from the social prestige of being the heir to the Duke of Rutland. He was briefly sole leader in 1848 before the triumvirate was created in the following year and continued until his resignation in 1851. John Charles Herries had at least held senior ministerial office. Both the Stamford MPs were easily eclipsed by the rising star of their colleague Benjamin Disraeli.|$|E

25|$|The future General Paul Huard, {{who served}} under de Gaulle at this time, {{recorded}} {{how he would}} often stand {{on a piece of}} high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards’ distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and taking all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b> Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the “hunter’s eye” of the great battlefield commander, and that not a single one of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.|$|E
25|$|In 1964–1965, Fa'our secured {{permission}} for his tribesmen in the Beqaa in Lebanon to purchase {{land in the}} Anti-Lebanon Mountains. The Beqaa tribesmen were not Lebanese citizens and thus not allowed to purchase land, but Fa'ours intercession with Interior Minister Kamal Jumblatt enabled them to acquire the land nonetheless. This success symbolized {{the change in the}} Al Fadl emir's traditional role, whereby he was no longer a wealthy benefactor and landlord of his tribesmen, but rather <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> who represented their interests. In addition, the Al Fadl emirs maintain a symbolic and moral legitimacy within the tribe based on their unproven claim of descent from Abbas and the Quraysh tribe.|$|E
25|$|Remuneration for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong {{is among}} the highest in the world for <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader,</b> and second only to that of the Prime Minister of Singapore.

In 2005, then-CE CH Tung received some HK$3million ($378,500). From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22million.

25|$|Leopold Moczygemba, a Polish priest, founded Panna Maria {{by writing}} letters back to Poland {{encouraging}} them to emigrate to Texas, a place with free land, fertile soils, and golden mountains. About 200-300 Poles took the trip and nearly mutinied when they encountered the desolate fields and rattlesnakes of Texas. Moczygemba and his brothers served as leaders during the town's development. The settlers and their children all spoke Silesian. Resurrectionist priests led church services and religious education for children. Letters sent back to Poland demonstrate a feeling of profound new experience in America. Hunting and fishing were favorite pastimes among the settlers, who were thrilled by the freedoms of shooting wild game in the countryside. The farmers used labor-intensive agricultural techniques that maximized crop yields of corn and cotton; they sold excess cotton to nearby communities and created profitable businesses selling crops and livestock. Polish leaders and Polish historical figures settled in the community, including Matthew Pilarcyk, a Polish soldier sent to Mexico in the 1860s {{to fight for the}} Austrian Emperor Maximilian. Some records recall that he fled the Army in 1867 during the fall of the empire, escaped a firing squad and traversed the Rio Grande to enter Panna Maria, where he had heard Poles were living. When he arrived, he married a local woman and joined the community as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b> The community was nearly massacred following the Civil War, where the government of Texas was dismantled and gangs of cowboys and former Confederate nativists harassed and shot at Poles in Panna Maria. The Poles in Panna Maria had Union sympathies and were the subject of discrimination by the local Southerners. In 1867, a showdown between a troupe of armed cowboys and the Polish community neared a deadly confrontation; Polish priests requested the Union Army to protect them, and a stationed Army helped keep them safe, registered to vote in elections, and free from religious intolerance. The language used by these settlers was carried down to their descendants over 150 years, and the Texas Silesian dialect still exists. Cemeteries contain inscriptions written in Polish or Polish-and-English. The Silesians held a millennial celebration for the Christianization of Poland in 966, and were presented a mosaic of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa by President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E

He embraced this moniker although his opponents used it negatively to denigrate him as a slick, smooth-talking demagogue who negatively influenced his constituents. In the Hawaiian tradition, his skills as an orator were attributed to the kuleana (responsibility) of his family as descendants of Kaiakea.|$|E
