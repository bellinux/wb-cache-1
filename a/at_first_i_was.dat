The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E

[...] While later announcing the release of the soundtrack album in a press release, Beyoncé said: [...] "Once you hear the song , and all the music in this film, you can't help but fall in love with it. You'll definitely get emotional. You might become happy or even sad, but your heart will get full. All the songs are touching and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like." ...|$|E

500|$|Of the {{starring}} cast, Pryce, Hurt, Redgrave and Tutin {{were already}} established screen actors, while Ayola had previously only acted theatrically. She appraised of her screen debut: [...] "it {{was a wonderful}} experience {{for me to be}} appearing alongside so many established names. It was very exciting although I must admit <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit daunted by the prospect." [...] The film featured several minor black characters, either as members of Gabriel's family, or as workers aboard the ship. When these roles were cast, complaints were made by black members of the British actors' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been [...] "passed over" [...] in favour of overseas artists. The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992. It was funded in the most part by the BBC, though a quarter of the budget came from the American Miramax. While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox, she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation [...] "just as horrendous a compromise". Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film failed to find theatrical distribution. It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994, then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995. It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later, on 11 November 1997.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E

2500|$|This {{time it is}} {{daughter}} and mom who switch bodies, following the successful intervention of the somewhat wacky and eccentric scientist grandpa, whose constant desire to improve the world resembles the enthusiasm of Christopher Lloyd's character (Dr. Emmett Brown - 'Doc') from the movie [...] "Back to the Future." [...] The confusion that ensues creates a funny and exciting novel. About the book, [...] Nogradi said, [...] "The idea of mom and daughter swapping bodies was an idea raised by children {{at one of the}} book signings. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hesitant to write the book, because writing a story about the inner feelings and thoughts of a small girl and her mother seemed a bit scary, but it {{became one of the most}} cherished books I ever wrote." [...] The book was made into a comedy and was premiered in theaters in Hungary.|$|E
2500|$|Richards and Flyers {{prospect}} Rob Bordson were {{traded to}} the Los Angeles Kings on June 23, 2011. In return, the Flyers received Wayne Simmonds, Brayden Schenn and Los Angeles' 2012 second-round draft pick. Richards reacted to the major deal by saying, [...] "I was very shocked. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shocked and then excited – I’m excited to move out to L.A. and {{be a part of}} a team that has a ton of great players. I’m just looking forward to helping them out." [...] A Dan Gross article suggested that Richards' [...] "hard-partying ways" [...] influenced the Flyers' decision to trade Richards. However, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren stated that it was [...] "preposterous" [...] that partying had anything to do with the trade. Jeff Carter was also traded, being sent to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Richards and Carter were reportedly traded due to their long contracts and to clear up cap space for Ilya Bryzgalov.|$|E
2500|$|Schoolboy Q had {{initially}} announced guest appearances {{on the album}} to include Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, ASAP Rocky, Danny Brown, and Action Bronson, while the production would be handled by in-house producers from Top Dawg Entertainment, such as Digi+Phonics members Sounwave and Tae Beast. In December 2012, Schoolboy Q revealed his collaboration with fellow American rapper Danny Brown, to be titled [...] "Eat." [...] However Schoolboy Q later revealed the song would not appear on the album. In a February 2013 interview, Schoolboy Q said he was [...] "like four records away from being done". During the same interview he claimed {{the making of the}} album was [...] "stressful and fun at the same time". He also stated there was a point in the recording process where he was stuck because he [...] "couldn't find the right beats." [...] In March 2013, he would later say: [...] "I stopped recording for about two months to gather my thoughts and see how I was gonna attack the album. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going a little too party. Then I started going too story. I was almost trying to make an album like Kendrick's. You try so many things. Now, I've finally got the right perfect mixture." ...|$|E
