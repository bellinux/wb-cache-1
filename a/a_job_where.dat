25|$|Exposure to {{asbestos}} in {{the form}} of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is friable, or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. However, in general, people who become ill from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> they worked directly with the material.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> {{there are}} many workers willing to work {{a large amount of}} time (high supply) {{competing}} for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. <b>A</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages {{due to the nature of}} the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.|$|E
25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanm√§rkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E

500|$|... "Homer's Enemy" [...] was {{directed}} by Jim Reardon and the script was written by John Swartzwelder, based on an idea pitched by executive producer Bill Oakley. The episode explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic hired for <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> he has to work alongside a man like Homer. He was partially modeled after Michael Douglas as he appeared in the film Falling Down. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, and based some of the character's mannerisms on actor William H. Macy.

[...] Sisto said of working on Into Temptation: [...] "Having just come off <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character, I felt this respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through my job was no less than a creative life saver." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the title}} role, King {{required}} the candidate be British, and considered casting an unknown actress. British actress Emily Blunt read the script, and aware other actresses would {{fight for the}} part, she approached King early in the search process. Blunt later admitted she had a [...] "non-existent knowledge" [...] of the queen, but after consulting her mother about Victoria's successful marriage, Blunt told King that the queen [...] "was a young girl who was very in love for the first time, {{and she was in}} <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>where</b> she felt way over her head. So I said to Graham, 'She's rebellious. She's a survivor.' I didn't want to approach her as the English rose, but as a young girl who was fighting". They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her Golden Globes acceptance speech for Gideon's Daughter. Blunt noted, [...] "I thought [...] was remarkable and such a challenge. This young girl, who was so feisty and emotional and strong-willed, was very fascinating to me... In my life and in the job I've chosen to do, you have to perform all the time. And I thought Victoria was a bit of an actress." [...] After winning the part, Blunt was allowed access to Windsor Castle, where she viewed Victoria's paintings, letters, diaries, and music composed by Albert himself.|$|E

50|$|A direct demand-side {{solution}} to unemployment is government-funded employment of the able-bodied poor. This was notably implemented in Britain from the 17th century until 1948 {{in the institution}} of the workhouse, which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use. A modern alternative is <b>a</b> <b>job</b> guarantee, <b>where</b> the government guarantees work at a living wage.|$|R

She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites ‚Äì from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production.
