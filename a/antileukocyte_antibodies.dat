40|$|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is {{the leading}} cause of transfusion-related death. The {{biologic}} processes contributing to TRALI are poorly understood. All blood products can cause TRALI, and no specific treat-ment is available. A “ 2 -event model ” has been proposed as the trigger. The first event may include surgery, trauma, or infection; the second involves the transfu-sion of <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> or bioac-tive lipids within the blood product. To-gether, these events induce neutrophil activation in the lungs, causing endothe-lial damage and capillary leakage. Neutro...|$|E

Methods: Following examinations were performed on potential kidney recipients in the HLA laboratory of the Transfusion Department, University Hospital Hradec Králové: serological fenotyping HLA-A, B (CDC test), PCR HLA-DRB 1 * genotyping (SSO, SSP) and screening of <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> (CDC test). Results: The total number of 154 potential kidney recipients were examined {{during the period of}} time from 1. 1. 2008 to 31. 12. 2010 (2008 : 57, 2009 : 46, 2010 : 51). Screening of <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> was performed on 1 140 samples, the most frequent result of antibody levels was between 0 - 30 %. Most patiens were at age of 41 - 61 years, male/female ratio was 2 : 1. The most frequent HLA antigens concerning the group of patients with kidney diseases were HLA-A 2, HLA-B 8 and HLA-DRB 1 * 11. Conclusions: During the period under consideration the number of newly registered potential kidney recipients did not [...] ...|$|E
30|$|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) {{is defined}} as a noncardiogenic {{pulmonary}} oedema related to any transfusion therapy. Clinical features may be indistinguishable from other causes of acute lung injury (respiratory distress, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltration). As a result, this complication is perhaps underdiagnosed and underreported. Most TRALI symptoms occur within 1 to 2 hours after transfusion initiation, and almost all reactions occur by 6 hours after transfusion completion. The mechanisms implicated consist of passive transfer of <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> (anti-human leucocyte antigen [HLA]) from alloimmunized donors and the accumulation of bioactive mediators in a predisposing inflammatory condition.|$|E

40|$|The {{case of a}} 33 -year-old {{man with}} aplastic anemia who {{experienced}} recurrent episodes of hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates during infusions of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is described. With the use of high-dose corticosteroids, the patient’s original episodes resolved, and were subsequently prevented before additional administrations of ATG. Rare reports of an association between ATG and acute lung injury {{are found in the}} literature, {{but this is the first}} report of successful steroid-supported re-exposure. Although the mechanism of ATG-related acute lung injury remains uncertain, it may be parallel to the mechanism of transfusion-related acute lung injury because the pathogenesis of the latter relies, in part, on <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies.</b> ATG-related toxicity should be included in the differential diagnosis of new, infusion-associated pulmonary infiltrates, and corticosteroids may be a useful therapeutic consideration in the management...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOptimal {{selection}} of blood donors {{is critical for}} ensuring the safety of blood products. The current selection process is concerned principally with {{the safety of the}} blood donor at the time of donation and of the recipient at the time of transfusion. Recent evidence suggests that the characteristics of the donor may affect short- and long-term transfusion outcomes for the transfused recipient. We conducted a systematic review with the primary objective of assessing the association between blood donor characteristics and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases and performed manual searches of top transfusion journals for all available prospective and retrospective studies. We described study characteristics, methodological quality, and risk of bias and provided study-level effect estimates and, when appropriate, pooled estimates with 95 % confidence intervals using the Mantel-Haenszel or inverse variance approach. The overall quality of the evidence was graded using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. From 6121 citations identified by our literature search, 59 studies met our eligibility criteria (50 observational, 9 interventional). We identified the evaluation of association of 17 donor characteristics on RBC transfusion outcome. The risk of bias and confounding of the included studies was high. The quality of evidence was graded as very low to low for all 17 donor characteristics. Potential associations were observed for donor sex with reduced survival at 90 days and 6 months in male recipients that receive donated blood from females (hazard ratio 2. 60 [1. 09, 6. 20] and hazard ratio 2. 40 [1. 10, 5. 24], respectively; n = 1), Human Leukocyte Antigen - antigen D Related (HLA-DR) selected transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 0. 39 [0. 15, 0. 99] for the risk of transplant alloimmunization, n = 9), presence of <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> (OR 5. 84 [1. 66, 20. 59] for risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury, n = 4), and donor RBC antigens selection (OR 0. 20 [0. 08, 0. 52] for risk of alloimmunization, n = 4). Based on poor quality evidence, positive <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies,</b> female donor to male recipients, HLA-DR selected RBC transfusion, or donor RBC antigen selection may affect RBC transfusion outcome. Our findings that donor characteristics may be associated with transfusion outcomes warrant establishing vein-to-vein data infrastructure to allow for large robust evaluations.

40|$|Introduction HLA {{antibodies}} {{develop as}} a result of alloimmunization to HLA class I and II antigens. Their appearance is associated with frequent blood transfusions, allogeneic tissue and organ transplantation, pregnancy and immunization. It is established that after usage of single dose HLA nonmatched leukocytes, circulating lymphocytotoxic antibodies appear in serum of recipients, 10 to 12 days after alloimmunization. Case report This article describes a case report of a multi-transfused patient, with identified HLA-A 1 antibodies established by using microlymphocytotoxicity test and two different panels of HLA typed lymphocytes. The case report shows occurrence of febrile posttransfusion nonhemolytic reaction (FNHTR) in our patient after application of 410 ml resuspended erythrocytes. After transfusiologists recommendations for detecting lymphocytotoxic antibodies in patient's serum, we determined a specificity of monospecific antibody which caused posttrasnfusion FNHTR. Discussion and conclusion FNHTR may be caused by <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> or immunoinflammatory cytokines. It is more frequent in patients receiving platelet concentrates (15 - 30 %) than those receiving red blood cell products (1 %). This case report shows that FNHTR was caused by HLA-A 1 antibody in a patient who received 111 various blood products...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{reactivity}} on routinely prepared tissue sections has hampered {{the use of}} monoclonal <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> in diagnostic histopathology. Here we describe five new antibodies reactive with leukocyte subsets in formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Antibody MT 1 is reactive with mature and immature T cells and not with mature B cells. MT 2 is reactive with mature T cells and B cells, but not with immature T cells, activated T cells, and germinal center B cells. Antibody MB 1 is reactive with all B cells, with about 50 % of mature T cells, and not with immature T cells. MB 2 is reactive with all B cells and not with T cells. However, MB 2 also stains endothelial cells and several types of epithelial cells. MB 3 is reactive with B cells and histiocytes, but not with T cells. The antibodies were tested {{on a series of}} lymphomas that were also immunophenotyped with a panel of well-established reagents on frozen tissue sections. The results indicate that the MB and MT antibodies are useful tools in the study of reactive and neoplastic disorders of the lymphoid system...|$|E
40|$|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) {{is a form}} of posttransfusion acute {{pulmonary}} insufficiency that has been linked to the infusion of biologic response modifiers (BRMs), including <b>antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> and lipids. Soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD 40 L) is a platelet-derived proinflammatory mediator that accumulates during platelet storage. We hypothesized that human polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNs) express CD 40, CD 40 ligation rapidly primes PMNs, and sCD 40 L induces PMN-mediated cytotoxicity of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). Levels of sCD 40 L were measured in blood components and in platelet concentrates (PCs) implicated in TRALI or control PCs that did not elicit a transfusion reaction. All blood components contained higher levels of sCD 40 L than fresh plasma, with apheresis PCs evidencing the highest concentration of sCD 40 L followed by PCs from whole blood, whole blood, and packed red blood cells (PRBCs). PCs implicated in TRALI reactions contained significantly higher sCD 40 L levels than control PCs. PMNs express functional CD 40 on the plasma membrane, and recombinant sCD 40 L (10 ng/mL- 1 μg/mL) rapidly (5 minutes) primed the PMN oxidase. Soluble CD 40 L promoted PMN-mediated cytotoxicity of HMVECs as the second event in a 2 -event in vitro model of TRALI. We concluded that sCD 40 L, which accumulates during blood component storage, has the capacity to activate adherent PMNs, causing endothelial damage and possibly TRALI in predisposed patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Antileukocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> in sera from {{patients}} with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) were characterized by determining cross-reacting specificies with the antigens defined by OKT 3, OKT 4, OKT 8, OKM 1 and anti-Ia hybridoma antibodies (Abs). T cells were prepared by sheep erythrocyte (E) rosetting after removal of adherent cells. T cells, or non-T cells, were preincubated with SLE sera at 4 °C and then with monoclonal Abs. Binding by specific monoclonal Abs was assessed by two methods: rosetting with ox erythrocytes conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG {{and also in the}} fluorescence-activated cell sorter using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Using the rosetting method, we found that sera from SLE can block the binding of monoclonal mouse hybridoma anti-Ia Abs to T cells; the blocking of other monoclonal Abs was not consistent. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, preincubation with SLE sera lowered the intensity of staining and total percentage of either T or non-T cells stained by monoclonal anti-Ia Abs. Blocking of anti-Ia Abs binding by SLE sera was not histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR restricted and was not due to Fc receptor binding. These results indicated that antibodies in SLE sera react with structures contiguous to or identical with Ia determinants. Anti-Ia activities in SLE sera correlate with SLE disease activity. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between anti-Ia blocking activity in the sera and the percentage of Ia-positive T cells in the blood of SLE patients. Antibodies in SLE sera with anti-Ia blocking activity may {{play an important role in}} immune dysregulation in SLE patients...|$|E
