5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of <b>actomyosin</b> ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic chirality. <b>Actomyosin</b> {{networks}} have {{been implicated in}} generating an intrinsic chirality in individual cells. Cells grown out on chiral surfaces can show a directional left/right bias that is <b>actomyosin</b> dependent.|$|E
25|$|In muscle cells, <b>actomyosin</b> myofibrils makeup {{much of the}} cytoplasmic material. These myofibrils {{are made}} of thin {{filaments}} of actin (typically around 7nm in diameter), and thick filaments of the motor-protein myosin (typically around 15nm in diameter). These myofibrils use energy derived from ATP to create movements of cells, such as muscle contraction. Using the hydrolysis of ATP for energy, myosin heads undergo a cycle during which they attach to thin filaments, exert a tension, and then, depending on the load, perform a power stroke that causes the thin filaments to slide past, shortening the muscle.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} day after death, {{glycolysis}} continues until the accumulation of lactic acid causes the pH to reach about 5.5. The remaining glycogen, about 18g per kg, is believed to increase the water-holding capacity and tenderness of the flesh when cooked. Rigor mortis sets {{in a few hours}} after death as ATP is used up, causing actin and myosin to combine into rigid <b>actomyosin</b> and lowering the meat's water-holding capacity, causing it to lose water ("weep"). In muscles that enter rigor in a contracted position, actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that is tough on cooking – hence again the need to prevent pre-slaughter stress in the animal.|$|E
25|$|Six autosomal-dominant point {{mutations}} {{in the sequence}} {{have been found to}} cause various types of hearing loss, particularly sensorineural hearing loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear’s Organ of Corti. β-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly <b>actomyosin.</b> Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the F-actin in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Straub {{developed}} a novel technique for extracting muscle protein {{that allowed him}} to isolate substantial amounts of relatively pure actin. [...] Straub's method is essentially the same as that used in laboratories today. [...] Szent-Gyorgyi had previously described the more viscous form of myosin produced by slow muscle extractions as 'activated' myosin, and, since Straub's protein produced the activating effect, it was dubbed actin. [...] Adding ATP to a mixture of both proteins (called <b>actomyosin)</b> causes a decrease in viscosity. The hostilities of World War II meant Szent-Gyorgyi and Straub were unable to publish the work in Western scientific journals. Actin therefore only became well known in the West in 1945, when their paper was published as a supplement to the Acta Physiologica Scandinavica. Straub continued to work on actin, and in 1950 reported that actin contains bound ATP and that, during polymerization of the protein into microfilaments, the nucleotide is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate (which remain bound to the microfilament). [...] Straub suggested that the transformation of ATP-bound actin to ADP-bound actin played a role in muscular contraction. In fact, this is true only in smooth muscle, and was not supported through experimentation until 2001.|$|E

50|$|Unphosphorylated calponin binds to actin and {{inhibits}} <b>actomyosin</b> MgATPase. Ser175 phosphorylation {{alters the}} molecular conformation of calponin and dissociates calponin from F-actin. The consequence is {{to release the}} inhibition of <b>actomyosin</b> MgATPase and increase the production of force.|$|E

50|$|Anillins are {{required}} for the faithfulness of cytokinesis and its F-actin-, myosin-, and septin-binding domains implicate anillin in <b>actomyosin</b> cytoskeletal organization. In agreement with this belief, anillin-mutant cells have disrupted contractile rings. Additionally, it is hypothesized that anillin couples the <b>actomyosin</b> cytoskeleton to microtubules by binding MgcRacGAP/CYK-4/RacGAP50C.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the protein}} anillin {{originates}} from a Spanish word, anillo. Anillo means ring and shows that the name anillin references the observed enrichment of anillins at the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Anillins are also enriched at other <b>actomyosin</b> rings, most significantly, those {{at the leading edge}} of the Drosophila embryo during cellularization. These <b>actomyosin</b> rings invaginate to separate all nuclei for one another in the syncytial blastoderm.|$|E

50|$|In more detail, after receptors on {{the cell}} {{recognize}} extracellular signals, cell contents are polarized to create different front and rear environments. Already, adhesion forces between the substrate and cell {{are present in the}} form of integrin/ICAM binding between cells. The uropod protrusion extends from the cell body due to actin polymerization and <b>actomyosin</b> extension, as cellular signals interact with cell and membrane contents. <b>Actomyosin</b> contraction pushes the cell forward by squeezing the cell contents in the direction of cell movement, prompting release of adhesion forces between the cell and environment and resulting in an overall change in position towards the extracellular signals.|$|E
50|$|Embryonic cTnT {{with more}} {{negative}} charge at the N-terminal region exerts higher calcium sensitivity of <b>actomyosin</b> ATPase activity and myofilament force production, {{compared with the}} adult cardiac TnT, {{as well as a}} higher tolerance to acidosis.|$|E
5000|$|In mitosis, F-actin and myosin II form {{a highly}} {{contractile}} and uniform cortex to drive mitotic cell rounding. The surface tension {{produced by the}} <b>actomyosin</b> cortex activity generates intracellular hydrostatic pressure capable of displacing surrounding objects to facilitate rounding.|$|E
50|$|ROCKs {{contribute}} to neurite retraction by inducing growth cone collapse by activating <b>actomyosin</b> contractility. It {{is also possible}} that phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) by ROCK inhibits CRPM2 function of promoting axon outgrowth, resulting in growth cone collapse.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} for myopathy in individuals with low vitamin D {{is not completely}} understood. A decreased availability of 250HD leads to mishandling of cellular calcium transport to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and is associated with reduced <b>actomyosin</b> content of myofibrils.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{in vitro}} {{experimental}} {{data indicate that}} calponin 1 functions as an inhibitory regulator of smooth muscle contractility through inhibiting <b>actomyosin</b> interactions. In this regulation, binding of Ca2+-calmodulin and PKC phosphorylation dissociate calponin 1 from the actin filament and facilitate smooth muscle contraction.|$|E
50|$|The Coronin protein {{family was}} {{discovered}} in 1991 by Eugenio L. Hostos. Hostos used a cytoskeletal preparation called the “contracted propeller” that efficiently helped with the purification of cytoskeletal proteins. This technique allowed him to precipitate <b>actomyosin</b> components together with the desired proteins.|$|E
50|$|Gliding {{motility}} {{is a form}} of actin-based motility in apicomplexans and diatoms {{that uses}} a large complex of proteins to link force generation by an internal <b>actomyosin</b> network to an external substrate. Other studies have shown more detail in this mechanism in the apicomplexa.|$|E
50|$|Calponin 3 {{has been}} shown to {{participate}} in actin cytoskeleton-based activities such as that in embryonic development and myogenesis. Unlike calponin 1, calponin 3 has little effect on <b>actomyosin</b> Mg2+-ATPase activity and does not cause actin filaments bundling at the same condition as calponin 1 does.|$|E
50|$|The cell cortex, {{also known}} as the actin cortex or <b>actomyosin</b> cortex, is a {{specialized}} layer of cytoplasmic protein on the inner face of the plasma membrane of the cell periphery. It functions as a modulator of plasma membrane behavior and cell surface properties. In most eukaryotic cells lacking a cell wall, the cortex is an actin-rich network consisting of F-actin filaments, myosin motors, and actin-binding proteins. The <b>actomyosin</b> cortex is attached to the cell membrane via membrane-anchoring proteins called ERM proteins and it plays a central role in cell shape control. The protein constituents of the cortex undergo rapid turnover, making the cortex both mechanically rigid and highly plastic, two properties essential to its function. In most cases, the cortex is in the range of 100 to 1000 nanometers thick.|$|E
50|$|Rounding {{forces are}} driven by {{reorganization}} of F-actin and myosin (<b>actomyosin)</b> into a contractile homogeneous cell cortex that 1) rigidifies the cell periphery and 2) facilitates generation of intracellular hydrostatic pressure (up to 10 fold higher than interphase). The generation of intracellular pressure is particularly critical under confinement, such as would be important in a tissue scenario, where outward forces must be produced to round up against surrounding cells and/or the extracellular matrix. Generation of pressure is dependent on formin-mediated F-actin nucleation and Rho kinase (ROCK)-mediated myosin II contraction, {{both of which are}} governed upstream by signaling pathways RhoA and ECT2 through the activity of Cdk1. Due to its importance in mitosis, the molecular components and dynamics of the mitotic <b>actomyosin</b> cortex is an area of active research.|$|E

50|$|ROCKs {{regulate}} cell-cell adhesion: Loss of ROCK activity {{seems to}} lead to loss of tight junction integrity in endothelial cells. In epithelial cells inhibition of ROCK seems to decrease tight junction integrity. Active ROCK in these cells seems to stimulate the disruption of E-Cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts by activating <b>actomyosin</b> contractility.|$|E
50|$|Hepler {{identified}} actin microfilaments {{in bundles}} at the ectoplasm-endoplasm interface of Nitella internodal cells {{by showing that}} the bundles bound heavy meromyosin, giving the characteristic arrowhead arrangement. The actin microfilaments had the correct polarity {{to be part of}} the <b>actomyosin</b> motor that provides the motive force for cytoplasmic streaming in these giant algal cells.|$|E
50|$|ROCKS {{play a role}} in {{membrane}} blebbing, a morphological change seen {{in cells}} committed to apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic protease, caspase 3, activates ROCK kinase activity by cleaving the C-terminal PH domain. As a result, the autoinhibitory intramolecular fold of ROCK is abolished. ROCK also regulates MLC phosphorylation and <b>actomyosin</b> contractility, which regulate membrane blebbing.|$|E
5000|$|Vanadate is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of certain plasma membrane ATPases, such as Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA). However, it does not inhibit other ATPases, such as SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase), <b>actomyosin</b> ATPase and mitochondrial ATPase.Aureliano, Manuel; Crans, Debbie C. (2009).

50|$|A {{non-invasive}} elastography {{technique that}} measures muscle noise is undergoing experimentation {{to provide a}} way of monitoring neuromuscular disease. The sound produced by a muscle comes from the shortening of <b>actomyosin</b> filaments along the axis of the muscle. During contraction, the muscle shortens along its longitudinal axis and expands across the transverse axis, producing vibrations at the surface.|$|E
50|$|ROCK1 is {{a protein}} serine/threonine kinase {{also known as}} rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1. Other common names are ROKβ and P160ROCK. ROCK1 is a major {{downstream}} effecter of the small GTPase RhoA and is a regulator of the <b>actomyosin</b> cytoskeleton which promotes contractile force generation. ROCK1 {{plays a role in}} cancer and in particular cell motility, metastasis, and angiogenesis.|$|E
50|$|The term actoclampin {{is derived}} from acto- to {{indicate}} the involvement of an actin filament, as in <b>actomyosin,</b> and clamp to indicate a clasping device used for strengthening flexible/moving objects and for securely fastening two or more components, followed by the suffix -in to indicate its protein origin. An actin filament end-tracking protein may thus be termed a clampin.|$|E
