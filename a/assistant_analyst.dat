40|$|This text {{is based}} on {{participant}} observation research as an <b>assistant</b> financial <b>analyst</b> in a multinational asset management company based in France in 2004. The purchase of credit derivatives, based on US mortgages, by the employees of this French multinational {{on behalf of their}} clients situated around the world, integrated thousands of people in a series of financial interdependencies, the hierarchies and violence of which were managed by other employees like those observed in the fieldwork. The text shows that the distribution of the money through these practices must be understood as the result of organizational logics within the company and within the commercial network of which the company is part. These professional practices are coordinated globally, from one company to another, and from one jurisdiction to another, through shared imaginaries according to which monetary gains are “value creation” that results from the encounter of “investors” in “efficient markets”. These concepts do not only articulate political discourses that were used to justify regulatory changes in the financial industry in the last thirty years, in the US, Europe and many other jurisdictions, but they are also present in the details of the definition of financial formulas, in the methodologies and in the organization of financial companies. For these reasons, professionals also mobilize these discourses to make sense of and to justify their everyday practice. The text shows the difference there is between these professional and bureaucratic practices and the theoretical meanings of the concepts that are used to justify them. In this way, the text contributes to a critique of the regulations and of the organization of the distribution of money by the financial industry, in the global space of its operations...|$|R
50|$|Peter William Dizozza {{was born}} on September 5, 1958 in Forest Hills (Queens), New York. He and his sister, Monica, are the two {{children}} of an attorney, Nicholas Frederick Dizozza, who came from a large family in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and a teacher, Madeleine, {{the only child of}} Margaret and Anthony Carillo who settled in Forest Hills. Although a fourth-generation New Yorker through both his grandmothers' lineages, Dizozza's ancestry is Italian. His paternal grandfather, Peter Dizozza, was born in Ginosa (Bari), and his maternal grandfather was born in San Giuseppe (Naples). Dizozza had a conservative and strongly Catholic upbringing. He attended Our Lady Queen of Martyrs grammar school and Archbishop Malloy High School in Queens, New York, and then went to Queens College, graduating with a Humanities Degree in Music, English, and Philosophy. After a series of summer jobs with the City of New York obtained through his maternal grandmother's friendship with a Brooklyn political leader, Meade Esposito, in 1981, at the age of 23, Dizozza joined the City Comptroller's Office and worked as an <b>assistant,</b> financial <b>analyst,</b> and court representative under Harrison J.

During this time, she had the opportunity to spend most of her time in the field studying well samples, driller's logs, and fossil collections. Her first published work, [...] "Stratigraphy of North Dakota" [...] came {{as a result of the}} experience she acquired. Kline had a distinguished career working in her respective field of study for a number of companies in the Tri-State area of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky during 1940. These companies included Michigan Oil Exploration, Chapman Minerals Corporation and Sohio Producing Company, where she worked as the only geologist for all three during the depression. During this time she became well familiarized with the stratigraphic characteristics of the area, and became proficient in tasks relating to sample studying and well-sitting. 1941 found her doing consulting work in Lansing, Michigan, while she was in school working on her library sciences degree, eventually working briefly as the librarian for the Civil Engineering School at the University of Michigan. The following year, she accepted a position at the University of Mississippi as associate professor of geology in the department of geology, on top of becoming an assistant geologist within the Mississippi Geological Survey. This position granted her the ability to co-author [...] "Geology of Clay County, Mississippi", writing the section [...] "Clay County Fossils: Midway Foraminifera and Ostracoda". In 1943, during World War II, she became <b>assistant</b> petroleum <b>analyst</b> in Chicago Office of Petroleum Administration. The following year found her accepting a position at the Illinois State Geological Survey as an associate geologist in the oil and gas section, where she worked for fourteen years until the end of her days, making many contributions to the knowledge of geology.

40|$|Flight Operations Analysts (FOAs) in the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) are {{responsible}} for monitoring a satellite's health and safety. As satellites become more complex and data rates increase, FOAs are quickly approaching a level of information saturation. The FOAs in the spacecraft control center for the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite are currently using a fault isolation expert system named the Communications Link Expert Assistance Resource (CLEAR), to assist in isolating and correcting communications link faults. Due {{to the success of}} CLEAR and several other systems in the control center domain, many other monitoring and fault isolation expert systems will likely be developed to support control center operations during the early 1990 s.

This paper presents VenusIDS: an active database component of the Network Exploitation Detection <b>Analyst</b> <b>Assistant</b> (NEDAA) developed as an enhancement to the analysis layer of a two-layer distributed network intrusion detection system using the VenusDB active database system. The layers consist of a network layer and an analysis layer. The network layer contains probes on each subnetwork that sniff network traffic and forward interesting packets in real time to a central Oracle database. The analysis layer comprises this central database and the mechanism to identify and report intrusions. For active-database technology to form an effective basis for intrusion detection, it must be capable of processing network events at least {{as fast as the}} network probes produce and log them. Our performance results show that VenusIDS is more than fast enough to handle this rate. Further, VenusIDS is scalable in the number of rules and size of the underlying database. As context for the VenusIDS component, we begin by describing the application architecture and the VenusDB system, with emphasis on the particular features that are important to distributed intrusion detection. We follow that with a description of the VenusIDS component and its performance profile that enables near real time intrusion detection. We conclude with a discussion of future topics for active-database analysis layers...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of system}} {{reduction}} and limitation of doses in persons working with sources of ionizing radiation and in inhabitants This dissertation discusses {{a system of}} limits and its development, i. e. how did the radiation dose limits change due {{to the safety of}} staff working with ionizing radiation and how did the limits of exposure of the population change. The introduction part of this dissertation deals with basic principles of radiation protection, namely with its optimization { [...] } with ALARA system. In the Current situation chapter there is a system of limits for reduction of radiation (Sec. 18 and 22 of the State Office for Nuclear Safety Decree No 307 / 2002 Sb.) and derived limits. The main part of this project focuses on monitoring of the practical development of the system of limits. In the Radiation Oncology Institute of the Faculty Hospital Na Bulovce (Ústav radiační onkologie Fakultní nemocnice Na Bulovce) archive I received data from the CSOD. I processed listing of both free-month and one-month doses received by the staff and I studied the way the doses decrease and mainly how does the number of personnel in whose cases the doses exceeded their limits decrease. I involved three most numerous groups of personnel. The first group consists of radiology <b>assistants</b> and <b>analysts,</b> the second group consists of medical doctors and physicists and the third group consists of medical nurses who were monitored only till 2003. The greatest decrease can be noticed since 2003 when the listings of radiation doses started being evaluated on monthly basis. I think that monthly evaluation of doses is a great landmark in the issue of protection of personnel involved with ionizing radiation. I transferred the data about these doses into several charts. I divided exceeded doses into individual scales and processed them statistically. There is a table in the discussion part of this dissertation work where even historical dose limits and dose equivalents are converted to mSv units (i. e. mSv/year) so that {{it would be possible to}} compare the limits. The process of radiation protection of the personnel in the Institute is also dealt with...|$|R
