5|$|Nansen was now {{considered}} an oracle by all would-be explorers {{of the north}} and south polar regions. <b>Abruzzi</b> had consulted him, as had the Belgian Adrien de Gerlache, each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic. Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer Carsten Borchgrevink (whom he considered a fraud), he gave advice to Robert Falcon Scott on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901–04 Discovery Expedition. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained on the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Regina Elena {{was laid}} {{down at the}} La Spezia {{shipyard}} on 27 March 1901, and was launched on 19 June 1904. After fitting-out work was completed, she was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 11 September 1907. She thereafter served in the Mediterranean Squadron, and {{was ready for the}} annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti. In April 1908, Regina Elena participated in a naval demonstration off Asia Minor in protest of the Ottoman decision to prohibit Italian post offices in Ottoman territory. The ship was at that time commanded by Prince Luigi Amedeo, the Duke of the <b>Abruzzi.</b> The ship went to Messina {{in the aftermath of the}} 1908 Messina earthquake. Regina Elena remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time her three sisters had been completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six, including the two s.|$|E
5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 {{began on}} 29 September 1911, Marco Polo was {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was quickly transferred, however, to the command of Rear-Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the <b>Abruzzi,</b> Inspector of Torpedo Boats. His command was deployed in the Adriatic Sea and was patrolling the area for Ottoman ships. Marco Polo and two destroyers stopped an Austro-Hungarian ship on 5 October in the bay at San Giovanni di Medua, Albania, and when they sent a boat to board the merchant ship, Ottoman coastal artillery began firing at the boat. The Italian ships returned fire for 45 minutes and silenced the guns after nearly exhausting their ammunition. The incident prompted a diplomatic protest by Austria-Hungary and Italy ceased its operations against the Ottomans in Albania. Marco Polo was then transferred to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron, operating off the Libyan coast.|$|E

50|$|An undisputed new {{altitude}} {{record was}} achieved in 1909 by the Duke of the <b>Abruzzi's</b> {{expedition to the}} Karakoram. After failing to make progress on K2 the Duke made an attempt on Chogolisa, where he reached a height of approximately 7,500 m (24,600 ft) before turning around just 150 m below the summit due to bad weather {{and the risk of}} falling through a cornice in poor visibility.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{will focus}} on non-scientific Italian {{perspectives}} on the Arctic {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century.

More specifically, I {{will focus on}} the Duke of <b>Abruzzi's</b> Polar Expedition of 1900 and Umberto Nobile's expedition of 1928. These cases are of particular interest in terms of artistic and literary reception, popular imagery, and political implications...|$|R

25|$|The {{colonial period}} {{emigration}} to Italian Somaliland initially mainly consisted of men. Emigration of entire families was only later promoted during the Fascist period, {{mainly in the}} agricultural developments of the Villaggio Duca degli <b>Abruzzi</b> (Jowhar), near the Shebelle River. In 1920, the Societa Agricola Italo-Somala (SAIS) was founded by the Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the <b>Abruzzi</b> in order to explore the agricultural potential of central Italian Somaliland and create a colony for Italian farmers.|$|E
500|$|In 1900 Nansen became {{director}} of the Christiania-based International Laboratory for North Sea Research, and helped found the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Through his connection with the latter body, {{in the summer of}} 1900 Nansen embarked on his first visit to Arctic waters since the Fram expedition, a cruise to Iceland and Jan Mayen Land on the oceanographic research vessel Michael Sars, named after Eva's father. Shortly after his return he learned that his Farthest North record had been passed, by members of the Duke of the <b>Abruzzi's</b> Italian expedition. They had reached 86°34′N on 24 April 1900, in an attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land. Nansen received the news philosophically: [...] "What is the value of having goals for their own sake? They all vanish ... it is merely a question of time." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{one of the}} Fox River Eight escapees, C-Note's main {{specialty}} {{revolves around}} being able to smuggle any random material {{in and out of}} any given territory. Apparently, this was also notified by his commanding officer right before he was dishonorably discharged. He also has an observant side about him, as he is the only one whom Scofield reluctantly recruited for the escape to have figured out what <b>Abruzzi's</b> PI crew were conducting on the break room on his own. While he genuinely respects Scofield as the man who broke them out of jail, C-Note, like any other father, cares more for his family and going even as far as handing Michael out to Mahone in exchange for his family's safety as well as attempting a suicide. When Roy Geary smugly stole an object of sentimental value from Westmoreland (whom C-Note forced into handing over to keep the plan safe), his immediate expression was anger.|$|R

25|$|By 1953, four expeditions had {{attempted}} to climb K2. Oscar Eckenstein and Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the <b>Abruzzi</b> had led expeditions in 1902 and 1909 respectively, neither of which had made substantial progress, and the Duke of the <b>Abruzzi</b> had declared after his attempt that the mountain would never be climbed. However, two American expeditions in 1938 and 1939 had come closer to success. Charles Houston's 1938 expedition had established the feasibility of the <b>Abruzzi</b> Spur as a route to the summit, reaching the Shoulder at 8000m, before retreating due to diminishing supplies {{and the threat of}} bad weather. Fritz Wiessner's attempt the following year went even higher, but ended in disaster when four men disappeared high on the mountain. In spite of the tragedy, the expeditions had shown that climbing K2 was a realistic goal, and further attempts would almost certainly have been made sooner had the Second World War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 not made travel to Kashmir impossible during the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The Neapolitans, {{commanded}} by General Pepe, {{made no attempt}} to defend the difficult defiles of the <b>Abruzzi,</b> and were defeated at Rieti (7 March 1821). The Austrians entered Naples.|$|E

25|$|Because 75% {{of people}} who climb K2 use the <b>Abruzzi</b> Spur, these listed routes are rarely climbed. No one has climbed the East Face of the mountain, due to the {{instability}} of the snow and ice formations on that side.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the new Italian governors, Guido Corni and Maurizio Rava, started {{a policy of}} {{assimilation}} of the local populace, enrolling many Somalis in the Italian colonial troops.

25|$|In 1926, the {{agricultural}} colony of Villaggio Duca degli <b>Abruzzi</b> comprised 16 villages, with some 3,000 Somali and 200 Italian inhabitants, and was {{connected by a}} 114km new railway to Mogadishu.
