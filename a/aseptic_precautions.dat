40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} the ratio of {{aspartate}} aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in patients of chronic liver disease (CLD) of various origins has gained much attention. This variable is readily available, easy to interpret, and inexpensive and the clinical utility of the AST/ALT ratio in the diagnostic workup of patients with CLD is quite promising. Objective: The present {{study was designed to}} find out the link between aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio with commonly measured biochemical parameters of liver function tests in CLD of viral origin. Materials and method: This cross sectional study was carried out in the department of Biochemistry, Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Forty four biopsy proven diagnosed subjects of chronic viral hepatitis without cirrhosis of both sex were selected purposively. With <b>aseptic</b> <b>precaution</b> 5 mL venous blood was collected from each subject and common liver function tests (serum AST, ALT, AST/ALT ratio, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, serum total protein, serum albumin, serum globulin, serum albumin/globulin ratio, prothrombin time) and viral serology (HBsAg, Anti HDV antibody, Anti HCV antibody) were performed. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 19 for Windows. Pearson’s correlation test was done to determine association between AST/ALT with other biochemical parameters.

Following strict <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> during a hemodialysis (HD) session could reduce dialysis-related infection, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity rates. This retrospective study was undertaken to identify the prevalence of dialysis-related bacteremia, sepsis, and catheter infections during HD at Bahrain Specialist Hospital, Bahrain, after following rigid infection control pro-cedures. All HD sessions performed between January 2004 and December 2007 were included. Strict <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> were observed for every patient in our dialysis unit. The patients&#x 2032; demographic characteristics as well as presence of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and use of immunosuppressive drugs were recorded. Results of culture of dialysis catheter tip were collected for all catheters removed or changed during the study period. Catheter surface culture yielding more than 15 colonies and catheter lumen culture yielding more than 1000 CFU/mL were considered positive. All episodes of rigors, chills, bacteremia, and sepsis were recorded. Overall, a total of 1084 HD sessions performed on 46 patients were studied. The mean age of the study patients was 55. 2 years (SE 2. 5). Fifty four percent were male, 50 &#x 0025; had DM, 85 &#x 0025; had HTN and 11 &#x 0025; were immunosuppressed.

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} central venous {{catheter}} (CVC) -related bacteraemia among infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were analysed {{and the impact of}} surveillance and continuing education on the incidence of this complication investigated. Among patients admitted to a NICU, CVC-related bacteraemia increased from 1 / 15 (7 %) in 1987 to 11 / 26 (42 %) in 1988 (P = 0. 01). Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from bacteraemia patients showed clonal diversity by plasmid and chromosomal fingerprinting. A review of CVC care procedures suggested breaches in aseptic techniques. Catheter-care technique was revised to ensure maximal <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions,</b> including the use of sterile gloves, gown and drapes. The new policy was promoted by a continuing education programme and regular feed-back of CVC-related bacteraemia incidence to NICU staff. In the four-year follow-up period, the attack-rate of CVC-related bacteraemia decreased to 18 / 156 (12 %) patients [relative risk (RR) : 0. 27, 95 % confidence interval (CI); 0. 15 - 0. 51; P < 0. 001 vs the previous period]. By using the Cox's model proportional hazards, very low birth weight and the period before use of strict aseptic CVC care were found to be predictors of increased risk of catheter-related bacteraemia after adjustment for duration of catheterization. These data provide further evidence that strict <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> during the maintenance and utilization of CVC can contribute to lower the risk of catheter infection in critically ill neonates. Regular feedback of surveillance data was associated with a progressive decrease in incidence of infection, suggesting that it improved staff compliance with <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Organophosphorus (OP) {{poisoning}} is a {{major public}} health problem in developing world. OP pesticides inhibit carboxylic esterase enzymes including plasma cholinesterase (PChE). Clinical manifestations following OP poisoning {{can be associated with}} the extent of decrease of PChE. This study was designed to investigate the relevance of PChE level to clinical manifestations in OP poisoning and to evaluate usefulness of PChE in predicting clinical outcomes. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study which was conducted at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Karnataka from 1 st October 2009 to 30 th September 2010. Seventy-six OP poisoned patients were enrolled and their clinical manifestations were recorded. 5 -ml samples of intravenous blood were collected from each patient (on first day and fifth day of treatment) under strict <b>aseptic</b> <b>precaution</b> and the PChE level was measured. Results: In total, mean age of patients were 25. 5 (range: 21 - 30) years. Majority of patients were males (65. 7 %), from rural areas (86. 84 %) and agricultural workers (25 %). Main clinical findings at the time of admission were congested conjunctiva (87 %), pin point pupil (83 %), lacrimation (80 %), vomiting (78 %), non-reactive pupil (75 %), respiratory distress (60 %) and abdominal pain (37 %). Mean (SD) PChE at 6 hours post-exposure was 3672. 4 (4200. 1) IU/L.

40|$|In {{study of}} Puerperal Sepsis {{has already been}} made by various {{observers}} and from different standpoints. There is however as much information yet to be obtained or confirmed {{on account of the}} available statistics being comparatively small. Thus having the control {{of a large number of}} patients, I have felt it a duty to endeavour to increase the list of cases of this most important subject. In private practice the opportunity for a systematic research is not great, and the total number of cases seen is relatively small in comparison with those of a large Maternity Hospital with, in addition, an External Department, in which nearly 2500 patients are treated in their own homes annually. Here numbers are obtained and it is possible to collect the cases throughout every month of the year, so that a consecutive list results. In addition to this, I have been unable to find any records of the Bacteriology of fevers of the Puerperium from the Maternity Hospitals of the Three Kingdoms. In reports obtained elsewhere, the investigation has been either a purely Bacteriological one or a Clinical, in which while following the course of each case in reference to treatment, no attempt has been made to ascertain the specific cause. In this study an endeavour has been made to combine these two aspects, the germ being demonstrated at the commencement of the pyrexia, and the case being followed to its termination with a record of the events as they occurred. Although in 1850 Sir J. Y. Simpson published a paper on the "Analogy, between Puerperal and Surgical Fever" and investigations have since proved the analogy, there are still many practitioners who fail to appreciate and even deny their identity, and who will attend a woman in her confinement without any, or but scanty attempts at <b>aseptic</b> <b>precaution,</b> while they will take considerable care before performing any surgical operation. Thus any additional information on the subject seems of some value. A number of inquiries have been made into the Bacteriology of the Vagina, both of non-pregnant and pregnant women, and various results obtained, but a fairly definite conclusion has resulted. Therefore I have not attempted to carry any investigations into this region, but have waited until the condition of pyrexia manifested itself, and have then endeavoured to ascertain its cause in the simplest manner possible and directly from the uterus...|$|R

It {{has been suggested that}} using an intravenous cannula or a styletted needle may obviate the occurrence of epidermoid tumours. A total of 202 members of the Society for Paediatric Anaesthesia in New Zealand and Australia were invited to participate in this internet-based survey. Eighty-four responses were received. Most respondents used some form of antiseptic handwash (81 %), wore sterile gloves (85. 7 %), used antiseptic skin preparation (100 %) and draped the site (57. 1 %). When performing caudal blocks, 43. 1 % used unstyletted needles, 27. 2 % used styletted spinal needles and 29. 6 % used intravenous cannulas. However, 11. 9 % did not wash hands, 10. 7 % did not wear gloves and 42. 9 % did not drape the site. Three respondents reported neither handwashing, wearing gloves or draping, instead only using an alcohol swab for skin preparation. The majority of respondents in our region appear to use some level of <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions,</b> albeit to a variable degree.

40|$|In this {{simplified}} microbiological assay for serum vitamin B 12, Lactobacillus Ieichmanhi (NCIB 8117) {{adapted to}} tolerate high concentrations (500 mg/L) of the polymyxin antibiotic colistin sulfate is used. Results {{were similar in}} parallel experiments in which we used both the parent strain of L. Ieichmanll (NCIB 8117), and the new adapted strain. Evalua-tion of assay performance showed excellent analytical recov-ery of added cyanocobalamin (97 %, SD 3 %) and good interassay and intra-assay precision (CV < 5 %). This modi-fied assay system obviates the need to sterilize culture medium and glassware. Consequently, assay manipulations may be carried out openly, without <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions.</b> Moreover, this adapted organism would be suitable for use in an automated microbiological assay system. Microbiological assays of vitamin B 12 in serum have been extensively used as an index of cobalamin status in man and give consistent results, with good clinical correlates (1 - 4). The stringent <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> necessary in such assays (5, 6) make them both long and tedious. The development of radioisotope dilution assays for vitamin B 12 in the 1960 s (7, 8) led to {{the widespread use of}} several different commercial-ly available kit systems. However, radiodilution assays based on the use of intrinsic factor as a competitive cobala-mm binder have given clinically misleading results (9, 10) and continue to do so despite considerable modifications of methodology (6).

Strict criteria for the management of the indwelling CVC were observed. The catheter tips were cultured after removal: only one was infected in the heparin group compared with nine in the control group. This significant reduction may have been due to the heparin preventing a fibrin sleeve from forming around the catheter tip.

Periodic monitoring and such interventions may also further improve safe injection practices...|$|E
40|$|Five actinophages highly {{specific}} for Streptomyces mediterranei {{were isolated}} from lysed broth cultures. Studies {{were performed on}} the effect of plating conditions on plaque formation. The development of phage-resistant strains of S. mediterranei not only eliminated the phage but also significantly increased rifamycin yields. The phage-resistant cultures proved to be more unstable than the original sensitive strain. Maintenance of the cultures as frozen vegetative mycelium assured culture stability and reproducibility of the results. Strict <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> throughout the laboratories and fermentation areas did not eliminate the danger of phage infection; effective control was obtained only with the introduction of resistant strains. S. mediterranei phages proved to be highly specific for calcium as an adsorption cofactor; addition of calcium-sequestering agents to sensitive mycelium completely prevented its lysis by the phage. The resistant strains developed were capable of adsorbing the phage and of releasing it without multiplication upon aging of the mycelium. No marked morphological, cultural, or biochemical differences were found among the various phage-resistant strains...|$|E
40|$|Unanesthetized {{immature}} albino rabbits {{exposed to}} 2 hours of severe but reversible hemorrhagic shock induced with <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> by multiple cardiac bleedings exhibited {{no increase in}} susceptibility to single intravenous injections of 200 µg. /kg. E. coli endotoxin administered 4 hours post retransfusion, a quantity of endotoxin that {{was found to be}} the largest dose uniformly non-lethal to normal rabbits. Paired and randomly selected rabbits treated identically except for the additional procedure of a femoral arterial cutdown and ligation (without <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions)</b> exhibited increases in susceptibility to the same endotoxin of several hundredfold. This effect could not be attributed to the femoral cutdown and arterial ligation alone since such trauma when coupled with sham cardiac bleedings failed to increase susceptibility to 200 µg. /kg. of endotoxin. These data appear valid since sham cardiac bleedings produced no detectable impairment of myocardial contractility, while 2 hours of hemorrhagic shock at 50 mm. Hg with the Lamson reservoir technique caused an increase in endotoxin susceptibility comparable to that seen when cardiac bleedings were combined with a non-sterile femoral arterial cutdown and ligation. The mechanisms increasing the susceptibility to E. coli endotoxin were investigated. It was found that (a) rabbit femoral skeletal muscle is normally contaminated with clostridia, (b) the use of aseptic femoral wounding precautions exerted some suggestive protective influence, (c) the use of aseptic wounding precautions combined with immediate topical sulfanilamide and wound closure exerted a significant protective influence, and (d) prophylactic polyvalent gas gangrene antitoxin protected in a manner not demonstrable when diphtheria antitoxin was employed as a control. These observations suggest that clostridial wound infection is one mechanism whereby a femoral arterial cutdown lowers endotoxin resistance of the rabbit following hemorrhagic shock. It is, however, not the only mechanism since the ligation of a femoral artery during hemorrhagic shock led to edema following retransfusion equivalent to a mean of approximately 30 per cent of the original circulating plasma volume. The intensification of shock caused by this transudation presumably intensified reticulo-endothelial injury, and thus further lowered the resistance of the rabbit to an intravenous injection of endotoxin 4 hours following retransfusion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Eye {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} area of infection and is constantly exposed to variety of pathogens, but infections occur when the normal defence of the eye is compromised. The bacterial and fungal aetiologies and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern vary according to geographical and regional location. In this region of East Godavari District, no recent data is available regarding this, which highly justifies the study. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To identify the prevalent bacteria and fungus causing ocular infection that prevail in the community. To characterise the predisposing factors leading to ocular infection. To establish effective empiric therapy for control of common ocular bacteriological infection by the antibiotic sensitivity study. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was conducted in Ophthalmology OPD/IPD of GSL Medical College and General Hospital during the period from October 2011 -February 2013. Samples collected under <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions.</b> A total number of 170 culture-positive ocular infections out of 210 clinically diagnosed cases served as study group and 30 culture-positive cases out of 40 normal persons served as control group. RESULTS Among the 170 culture-positive cases, 72. 95...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was (i) To attempt {{isolation}} and identification of Salmonella species from samples. (ii) Serotyping of Salmonella isolates. (iii) Detection of virulence factor associated genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Materials and Methods: A total of 284 samples comprised of chevon and mutton (112 samples each) as well as 60 samples (20 each of retail meat shops environment samples viz. Butchers’ hands, knives and log swabs) were collected from the retail meat shops in and around Anand City under <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions.</b> Rappaport-vassiliadis soy bean meal broth and tetrathionate broth was used for the enrichment of all the samples and inoculation was done on brilliant green agar and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar. This was followed by the confirmation of isolates using biochemical tests. For the serotyping, isolates were sent to the National Salmonella and Escherichia Centre, Central Research Institute, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh. Detection of virulence genes was performed by PCR technique using previously reported primer. Result: Of 284 meats and retail meat shops environment samples, 13 (4. 58...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Background. Bloodstream {{infection}} (BSI) is {{a significant}} cause of morbidity and death encountered in the NICU. The rates of BSIs vary significantly in NICUs across the nation. However, no attempt {{has been made to}} correlate this variation with specific infection-control practices and policies. We experienced a signifi-cant increase in BSIs in the NICU at the George Wash-ington University Hospital and were seeking additional precautionary measures to reduce BSI rates. Our objec-tive was to review policies and practices associated with lower infection rates nationally and to test their repro-ducibility in our unit. Design and Methods. Data on BSI rates in 16 NICUs were reviewed. The BSI rate at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center (CCMC) was the lowest among those reviewed. A team from George Washington University Hospital conducted a site visit to CCMC to examine their practices. Differences in the <b>aseptic</b> <b>precautions</b> used for intravenous line management were noted at CCMC, where a closed medication system is used. This system was applied at George Washington University Hospital starting January 1, 2001. Infection rates among low birt...|$|E
