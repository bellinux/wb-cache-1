25|$|While the {{majority}} of monarchs are resident, a few species are partially migratory and one, the satin flycatcher, is fully migratory, although the Japanese paradise flycatcher is almost entirely migratory. The <b>African</b> <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> makes a series of poorly understood intra-African migratory movements.|$|E
25|$|The monarchs are {{generally}} monogamous, with the pair bonds ranging {{from just a}} single season (as in the <b>African</b> <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher)</b> to life (the Elepaio). Only three species are known to engage in cooperative breeding; but many species are as yet unstudied. They {{are generally}} territorial, defending territories that are around 2 ha in size, but a few species may cluster their nesting sites closely together. Nesting sites may also be chosen close to aggressive species, for example leaden flycatchers nests may be located near the nests of the aggressive noisy friarbird. The nests are in turn often aggressively defended by monarch species. In all species the nest is an open cup on a branch, fork or twig. In some species the nests can be highly conspicuous.|$|E

50|$|Several {{species of}} paradise flycatcher are migratory. The Japanese paradise flycatcher {{is almost entirely}} migratory, {{breeding}} in Korea and Japan and wintering in the Philippines, Malaysia and Sumatra. It does however also occur in Taiwan, where the population is apparently resident. The Indian paradise flycatcher ranges across the Indian subcontinent and adjoining regions. The movements of the other species are not fully understood, but most {{are thought to be}} resident. Several subspecies of the <b>African</b> <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> are apparently intra-African migrants, but little is known about these movements.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone viridis) is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird {{with a very}} long tail. It is a common resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The male is boldly coloured in chestnut and black and the female is rather more drab. This bird feeds mainly on insects and builds a tiny cup nest in a tree where two or three eggs are laid. This species is usually found in open forests and savannah habitats and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|The red-bellied {{paradise flycatcher}} (Terpsiphone rufiventer), {{also known as}} the black-headed paradise flycatcher, is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird of the family of monarch flycatchers. It is native to West Africa. The male bird is about 17 cm long and has a black head, a mainly chestnut body, and a tail with streamers nearly twice as long as the body. The colouring is somewhat variable across the bird's range. Both females and juveniles lack the tail streamers and are a duller brown colour. It is closely related to the <b>African</b> <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> and the two can hybridise.|$|E
50|$|Its name commemorates the American ornithologist George Latimer Bates. Bates's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> was {{formerly}} {{considered as a}} subspecies of the rufous-vented <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> but is now recognized as a separate species. An alternate name is the Cameroon rufous-vented paradise-flycatcher.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to both the Amur <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and Blyth's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> but is slightly smaller. Mature males have a black hood with a purplish-blue gloss which shades into blackish-grey on the chest. The underparts are off-white to white. The mantle, back, wings and rump are plain dark chestnut. The tail has extremely long black central feathers, which are shorter in immature males. Unlike the Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> there is no white morph. The female resembles the male but is duller and darker brown on the chestnut areas. It has black legs and feet, a large black eye with a blue eye-ring, and a short blue bill.|$|R
50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are {{generally}} small birds, around 18 to(-) 21 cm {{in length and}} weighing 12 to(-) 23 g. They have a medium length grey or blueish bill which is broad and hooked {{at the end and}} is surrounded by stiff rictal bristles. The inside of the mouths of paradise-flycatchers are brightly coloured, being either yellow or green. The tails are long, particularly in many species where the male has a massively elongated pair of middle tail feathers. These tail streamers are 195 mm long in the male São Tomé <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and 412 mm long in the male Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> The function of the long tail is assumed to be related to sexual selection, with females choosing males based on the length of the tail. Not all species have long tail streamers, for example the blue <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> of Palawan in Asia and the Bedford's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> of montane Africa do not have exceptionally long tails. In most species the tail is longer than the wing, even in the shorter tailed females. The eye is surrounded by an eyering that is a blue thin wattle (slightly more pronounced in some species like the rufous <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher).</b>|$|R
50|$|About 464 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Yemen, ten of which are endemic to the country including the Socotra buzzard, the Socotra scops owl, the Socotra cisticola, the Socotra warbler, the Socotra starling, the Socotra sunbird, the Arabian accentor, the Socotra bunting, the Socotra sparrow and the Abd al-Kuri sparrow. The cliff faces of the western highlands provide habitat for the griffon vulture, the Verreaux's eagle and the small Barbary falcon.

50|$|Birds {{native to}} Saudi Arabia include sandgrouse, quails, eagles, buzzards and larks {{and on the}} coast, seabirds include {{pelicans}} and gulls. The country is also visited by migratory birds in spring and autumn including flamingoes, storks and swallows.MacQueen's bustard is a resident species that is dependent on good vegetation cover, often being found in areas with dense scrubby growth with shrubs such as Capparis spinosa. The cliff faces of the Asir Mountains provide habitat for the griffon vulture, the Verreaux's eagle and the small Barbary falcon, and the juniper woodlands are home to the Yemen linnet, the Yemen thrush, the Yemen warbler and the <b>African</b> <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> The hamerkop nests in the Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, the only place on the Arabian Peninsula at which it is found.|$|E
50|$|The Amur <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone incei) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Monarchidae.It is found in China and Manchuria. It is a winter migrant to Southeast Asia. Until 2015, it was {{considered}} as a subspecies of the Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|R
50|$|The plumage of the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> is sexually dimorphic, with rufous, {{white and}} black being the most common colours; one species has blue plumage and a few have traces of maroon.

40|$|Mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks {{were studied}} at Kichwa Tembo Camp {{on the edge}} the Masia Mara National Reserve in Kenya between July and September 2004. Observations were made on 29 mixed-species flocks, in which 24 species participated. <b>African</b> <b>Paradise</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> Terpsiphone viridis, Black-backed Puffback Dryoscopus cubla, Grey-backed Cameroptera Camaroptera brachyura, Collard Sunbird Hedydipna collaris and Cabanis’s Greenbul Phyllastrephus cabanisi were the most common participants in mixed-species flocks, as well as among the most frequently encountered bird species overall. The Black-backed Puffback was identified as the nuclear species in flocks due to their abundance and frequency {{with which they were}} followed by other species. Mixed-species flocks represent another niche dimension in this diverse bird community, but few of these species could be described as flock specialists; most of the birds observed in mixed-species flocks in this study were opportunistic attendant species, including the African Pygmy Kingfisher Ispidina picta, not previously described as joining mixed-species flocks...|$|E

5000|$|When Carl Linnaeus first {{described}} the Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> in 1766, he assigned {{it to the}} genus Muscicapa, which contained many of the Old World flycatchers. The species remained in that genus until 1827, when Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger created the genus Terpsiphone for the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> [...] The genus name Terpsiphone comes from the Greek words terpsi, meaning [...] "delighted in" [...] (from terpo, [...] "to delight") and phone, meaning [...] "voice". The species name, mutata is Latin for [...] "changed" [...] or [...] "different". An alternate common name is the Madagascar <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} diurnal raptors, {{including}} Frances's sparrowhawk, yellow-billed kite and Madagascar harrier-hawk hunt Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> [...] In addition, {{there is at}} least one record of a common brown lemur eating a nestling Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> one of the few records of a wild lemur eating anything other than plant material.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{all members}} of its genus, the Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is an insectivore, feeding {{on a variety of}} insects. [...] It {{regularly}} joins mixed-species flocks, particularly those containing common newtonias. It is a [...] "follower" [...] in such flocks, allowing other birds to work as [...] "beaters"; it follows them and hunts down any insect prey they flush. Studies have shown that the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher's</b> foraging efficiency is directly correlated to the number of common newtonia in a flock; a greater number of common newtonias results in a higher foraging efficiency for any accompanying Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> When rufous vangas, which generally forage within a meter (yard) or so of the ground, are present in the same mixed-species flocks as Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> the latter preferentially follow the vangas, and therefore forage closer to the ground than they normally do.|$|R
