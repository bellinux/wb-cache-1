5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would be}} for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E

25|$|The first Portuguese {{encounter}} with the subcontinent was on 20 May 1498 when Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on Malabar Coast. Anchored {{off the coast of}} Calicut, the Portuguese invited native fishermen on board and immediately bought some Indian items. One Portuguese accompanied the fishermen to the port and met with a Tunisian Muslim. On the advice of this man, Gama sent <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men to Ponnani to meet with ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin. Over the objections of Arab merchants, Gama managed to secure a letter of concession for trading rights from the Zamorin, Calicut's Hindu ruler. But, the Portuguese were unable to pay the prescribed customs duties and price of his goods in gold.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} solo improvising concert, Frith would lay <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{homemade}} guitars flat {{on a table}} and play them {{with a collection of}} found objects (varying from concert to concert). He would drop objects, like ball bearings, dried beans, and rice on the strings while stroking, scraping, and hitting them with whatever was on hand. Later he added a live sampler to his on-stage equipment, which he controlled with pedals. The sampler enabled him to dynamically capture and loop guitar sounds, over which he would capture and loop new sounds, and so on, until he had a bed of repeated patterns on top of which he would then begin his solo performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, the marble floor. (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paintings as collateral.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} he {{constructed}} <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most successful inventions for military anti-aircraft defence. The invention was a tempering machine for anti-aircraft guns and it was introduced for military anti-aircraft instrumentation. Among other things, he collaborated with AB Bofors about his invention Impulse engine, a tempering machine for anti-aircraft autocannons. The Bofors 40 mm air-craft gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It {{was one of the}} most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II. In the mid-1930s the foundation for the company’s most famous product was laid, the Bofors 40mm automatic cannon, which during World War II were produced in different countries in 10,000 numbers of copies.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} shot at in Clover Field (now Santa Monica Airport) {{days before his}} crash. A couple of other {{incidents}} occurred before the crash as well. In 1921, DeLay and seven others (including his lawyer, Francis J. Heney), were brought into court. C. E. Frey, who insisted that he bought DeLay Airfield—yet he had no proof—had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thugs plant posts in DeLay's airport so that planes could not take off. After DeLay had his crew remove the posts, C. E. Frey's gang dug trenches so that the planes could not take off. C. E. Frey ended up in jail with B.H. DeLay, C. Y. DeLay (B.H.'s father), G. F. Stephenson, Howard Patterson, along with others such as stunt performers, Frank Clarke and pilots Wallace Timm and Glen Boyd. DeLay had purchased the airport from the Crawford Airplane Company in September 1919.|$|E
25|$|In the United Nations Security Council, early April 1994 saw a sharp {{disagreement}} between the United States and the non-permanent {{members of the}} council over UNAMIR. Despite a classified February Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysis predicting half a million deaths if the Arusha process failed, the U.S. was attempting to reduce its international commitments {{in the wake of}} the Somalia debacle and lobbied to end the mission. A compromise extending UNAMIR's mandate for three more months was finally reached on the evening of Tuesday, the fifth of April. Meanwhile, Habyarimana was finishing regional travel. On April 4, he had flown to Zaire to meet with president Mobutu Sese Seko and on the sixth flew to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania for a one-day regional summit for heads of state convened by Tanzania's President. On the return trip that evening he was joined by Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira, and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministers, who preferred the faster Dassault Falcon 50 that the French government had given to Habyarimana over Ntaryamira's own presidential plane.|$|E

25|$|Dhoni {{studied at}} DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand where he {{initially}} excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team {{and was sent}} to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well. Dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard. Dhoni was a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal. His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. But {{he also had a}} mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story made big news on the next day.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of August 1941, the AWPD consisted of only four officers: Harold L. George, Orvil Anderson, Kenneth Walker (each one a lieutenant colonel), and Major Haywood S. Hansell. To help answer {{the urgent need for}} planning, George could have sent <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> air officers to WPD to assist them, following the standard Army policy since air warfare first arose in World War I. An air plan would have been made emphasizing tactical air coordination with ground forces, one which targeted Axis military formations and supplies in preparation and support of an invasion. George wished to implement the strategic bombing theories that had been debated and refined at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) during the preceding decade, but was faced with the sure knowledge that the Army and the War Department would not accept a strategy that assumed air attack would prevail alone. Instead, George intended to implement a middle path which began with strategic air attack but contained allowances for the eventual support of a ground invasion. In requesting autonomy to make his own plans, George gained approval from General Arnold and from General Leonard T. Gerow, head of the overworked WPD, who approved as long as AWPD held to the guidelines of ABC-1 and Rainbow 5.|$|E

500|$|Wizkid {{was born}} on 16 July 1990 in Surulere, a {{residential}} and commercial area of Lagos. He {{grew up in an}} interfaith household with twelve female siblings. His mother is a Pentecostal Christian and his father practices Islam. In a 2012 radio interview with Tim Westwood, he said that his father has three wives. During his upbringing, he listened to songs recorded by King Sunny Ade, Fela Kuti, and Bob Marley. Wizkid started singing at age 11 and went by the stage name Lil Prinz until 2006. During an interview with Adesope of Factory 78 TV, Wizkid described his life in a nutshell. He said he formed a group called the Glorious Five with <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> church friends. The group managed to release an album prior to disbanding. Wizkid later met OJB Jezreel, a record producer who prevented him from recording for a year. While visiting OJB's PointBeat Studios frequently, he watched 2 Face Idibia record songs for his Grass 2 Grace album. He was also present during the recording sessions for Sound Sultan's debut album, Jagbajantis. Wizkid cited Naeto C as {{one of the people who}} mentored and coached him when he was 15 years old. Wizkid also told Factory 78 TV that his parents weren't receptive of his music from the onset. In order to gain his father's trust, he had to work hard and spend lots of time in the studio. Wizkid co-wrote Banky W's [...] "Omoge You Too Much", a song off The W Experience album. He also worked with Naeto C, OJB Jezreel, Ikechukwu, and M.I while developing his craft. In 2009, Wizkid inked a record deal with Banky W.'s Empire Mates Entertainment. In mid-2009, he dropped out of Lagos State University (LASU) to focus on his craft. He later attended Lead City University, but dropped out after completing two sessions.|$|E
500|$|Musicians Kid Rock and Joe C. guest {{starred in}} the episode as themselves, {{performing}} at the annual spring break concert that Homer sneaks out to attend. When Joe C. makes his first appearance on stage in the episode, Homer mistakes him for a child that has lost his parents. After performing his song [...] "Bawitdaba", Kid Rock tells the audience {{that he is going}} to pour out forty gallons of malt liquor on the curb as a way of showing respect to his homies that could not make it to the concert. When Homer hears this he starts to drink the malt liquor. Just as Kid Rock and Joe C. are about to stop him by hurling Joe C. (now wearing a spiked helmet) at him with a slingshot, the sheriff arrives and settles the situation. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer." [...] According to Scully, the two musicians [...] "had a great sense of humor [...] about themselves," [...] with Kid Rock asking if [...] "he could add <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title." [...] Kid Rock recorded some of his dialog over the phone, but also paid a 45-minute visit to the Simpsons studio in Los Angeles to record lines. Scully thought it looked like the singer enjoyed the experience and was surprised to see that he arrived on time. [...] "My first reaction to that was, 'What kind of rock star is this?'," [...] Scully jokingly told the Detroit Free Press. All of Joe C.'s lines were recorded over the phone.|$|E
