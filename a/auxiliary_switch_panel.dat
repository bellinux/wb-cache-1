The converter has two different operational characteristics. It shows the same operational characteristic with the conventional LLC resonant converters during nominal state. However, when ac line lost and the converter enters into the hold-up time state, which requires wide voltage gain changes,the control method of {{the proposed}} converter is transmuted to the PWM method utilizing the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>switch.</b> Since the proposed converter compensates wide voltage gain variation with PWM method of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>switch,</b> the frequency variation range for the LLC resonant converter is highly reduced in the proposed converter. Therefore the transformer in the proposed converter can be designed at the optimal operating point and it results in decremented conduction loss of the magnetizing inductor current.
