5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression <b>as</b> <b>predicted</b> by Boyle's law.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial amount of water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much <b>as</b> <b>predicted</b> beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient <b>as</b> <b>predicted.</b> Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E

5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, <b>as</b> <b>predicted,</b> the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1627, Kepler {{published}} his Rudolphine Tables. Two {{years later he}} published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet De raris mirisque Anni 1631 which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of Mercury in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761. The Mercury transit occurred <b>as</b> <b>predicted</b> and was observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach. But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System as Mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected.|$|E
5|$|In 1705, Edmond Halley (1656–1742) applied Newton's {{method to}} twenty-three cometary apparitions that had {{occurred}} between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar orbital elements, and he was further able {{to account for the}} slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation caused by Jupiter and Saturn. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9. Halley's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who predicted the date of the comet's 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy. When the comet returned <b>as</b> <b>predicted,</b> it became known as Halley's Comet (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). It will next appear in 2061.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the {{increased}} robustness of Balaur {{was compared to}} parallel changes seen in isolated herbivorous mammals. In 2013, it was claimed that Balaur was the only vertebrate predatory island species known to have become more robust and {{it was suggested that}} its broad feet had evolved to improve stability. The 2015 interpretation of Balaur as an omnivorous member of the Avialae, suggested it was the descendant of a flying species that had developed a larger size similar to the development in several other island herbivores. This would then be a rare instance of secondary flightlessness in a paravian looking like a dromaeosaurid, <b>as</b> <b>predicted</b> by Gregory S. Paul.|$|E

5|$|Paraná {{succeeded in}} passing electoral reform, which {{was called the}} Lei dos Círculos (Law of the Circles). <b>As</b> <b>predicted,</b> and feared, it gave greater powers to the {{president}} (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers to meddle in elections. Unexpectedly, Paraná fell ill and died on 3 September 1856. Caxias replaced him, but was reluctant to face the legislature, elected under the electoral reform, that was slated to convene the next year. He resigned, {{along with the other}} cabinet ministers, on 4 May 1857. The Law of the Circles and the controversy surrounding it split the Conservative Party: one faction was the saquarema ultraconservative (or tradionalist) wing, then called the vermelhos (reds) or puritanos (puritans), led by Eusébio de Queirós, Uruguai and Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itaboraí. The second bloc comprised the conservador moderado (moderate Conservative) wing, composed mostly of younger politicians who owed their positions to electoral reform.|$|E
5|$|Technetium {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between rhenium and manganese. <b>As</b> <b>predicted</b> by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult to quantify. The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line.

5|$|The {{second session}} on Thursday {{afternoon}} saw considerably less running than the first. A red flag was shown ten minutes into practice after Roberto Merhi crashed on the exit of the tunnel. During the stoppage, rain began to fall, keeping most drivers {{in the garage}} when practice was restarted. It was not until ten minutes {{from the end of}} the session that the drivers took to the track again, but under damp conditions they managed times that were slower than the pace set at the beginning. Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest, more than seven-tenths of a second in front of his team mate. Toro Rosso confirmed their high pace with Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen in sixth and seventh respectively, while McLaren proved they might challenge for points <b>as</b> <b>predicted,</b> with Fernando Alonso in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much <b>as</b> <b>predicted,</b> but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|While near peak intensity, Hurricane Linda passed near Socorro Island, {{where it}} damaged {{meteorological}} instruments.
