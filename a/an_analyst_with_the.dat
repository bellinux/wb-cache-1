500|$|In Beni Suef, {{south of}} Cairo, 17 protesters {{were killed by}} police as the protesters {{attempted}} to attack two police stations. In Abu Zabaal prison in Cairo, eight people were killed as police clashed with inmates trying to escape. According to a Reuters tally, these unconfirmed deaths brought the death toll to at least 100. Several Islamist terrorists and others escaped. Prison overcrowding and police brutality were voiced {{by many of the}} protesters. Emad Gad, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said that he had obtained information from a trustworthy source that [...] "there have been orders from the very top to free known felons from the prisons, to arm them and to let them mingle with protesters." [...] Two Egyptian policemen jailed following the death of anti-corruption activist Khaled Said were among the hundreds of prisoners that escaped in Cairo that day.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a conference}} on 15 June, Morsi called for foreign {{intervention}} in Syria. According to Yasser El-Shimy, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> International Crisis Group, this statement crossed [...] "a national security red line." [...] The army rebuked this statement the next day by stating that its only role was to guard Egypt's borders. Although the Egyptian constitution ostensibly declares the president as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the Egyptian military is independent of civilian control.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} {{there was a}} {{consensus}} within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they {{will never be able}} to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power. Thomas Petersnik, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Energy Information Administration put it this way: [...] "by and large, renewable energy sources are too rare, too distant, too uncertain, and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need".|$|E

2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because {{he did not believe}} it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by {{trying to get me to}} stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{exhibits}} of {{food are}} especially remarkable. We cleaned the glass case with our sleeves and {{peered at the}} most appetising revelations. There are dozens of little bottles hermetically sealed, containing such curios as a sample of [...] "Bacon Common (Gammon) Uncooked," [...] and then the same cooked--it looked no nicer cooked--Irish sausage, pork sausage, black pudding, Welsh mutton, {{and all kinds of}} rare and exquisite feeding. There are ever so many cases of this kind of thing. We saw, for instance, further along, several good specimens of the common oyster shell (Ostrea edulis), cockle shells, and whelks, both [...] "almonds" [...] and [...] "whites," [...] and then came breadstuffs. The breadstuffs are particularly impressive, of a grey, scientific aspect, a hard, hoary antiquity. We always knew that stale bread was good for one, but yet the Parkes Museum startled us with the antique pattern it recommended. There was a muffin, too, identified and labelled, but without any Latin name, a captured crumpet, a collection of buns, a dinner-roll, and a something novel to us, called Pumpernickel, that we had rather be without, or rather--for the expression is ambiguous--that we had rather not be without, but altogether remote from. And all these things have been tested by <b>an</b> <b>analyst,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most painful results. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and the like nasty chemical things seem indeed to have occurred in everything he touched. Those sturdy mendicants who go about complaining that they cannot get food should visit this Parkes Museum and see what food is really like, and learn contentment with their lot.|$|E
