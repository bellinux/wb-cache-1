5|$|The games chronicle {{the adventures}} of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by {{collecting}} and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders (Roark, Gardenia, Maylene, Crasher Wake, Fantina, Byron, Candice, and Volkner) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym Badges, key {{to the advancement of}} the plot. As all core games, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate (<b>and</b> <b>here,</b> <b>it</b> is Team Galactic), who plans to use Pokémon to create a new universe just for themselves, while destroying the current one.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{ceremony}} officially began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on 8 August 2008 in the Beijing National Stadium. The number 8 {{is associated with}} prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> was a triple eight for the date and one extra for time (close to 08:08:08pm). The ceremony was co-directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers. The ceremony lasted over four hours and {{was reported to have}} cost over US$100 million to produce.|$|E

Obviously what we call 'resemblance' involves different aspects in each particular case. It is also seen to be of a different 'degree' <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> fades with 'distance': Item_1 and Item_5 have nothing in common.|$|E

25|$|Pythagoras {{set up an}} {{organisation}} {{which was}} in some ways a school, in some ways a brotherhood (<b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> {{should be noted that}} sources indicate that as well as men there were many women among the adherents of Pythagoras), and in some ways a monastery. It was based upon the religious teachings of Pythagoras and was very secretive. The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. There is mentioning of an oath on the Tetractys.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James Beatty, who {{had played}} an {{important}} part in working with Peto's partnership to build the European and North American Railway, was recruited as chief engineer. The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell, who had also worked on the European and North American Railway. Campbell's first task was to create a wharf at Balaclava where the railway materials could be unloaded, with a yard adjacent. He planned for the track to pass along the middle of the main street of the town. It then went through a gorge at the north of the town close to the water's edge and over swampy ground to the village of Kadikoi. From here, the railway had to rise some [...] {{to the top of the}} plateau. Of the routes available, Campbell chose to follow the existing road. Although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7, Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14. [...] A stationary engine would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline. Once on the plateau, the ground was rough but fairly level <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> presented fewer problems. Lord Raglan's headquarters were at the top of the col, and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, it is equally clear that a locally connected space is weakly locally connected, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> {{turns out that the}} converse does hold: a space which is weakly locally connected at all of its points is necessarily locally connected at all of its points.

From his description of his chamber, it has erroneously been supposed, that his bed being too short for him, his feet, during the night, were in the mire; whereas he has only said, that when he undressed, he felt his feet in the mire: that is, the clay-floor of the room, on which he stood before he went into bed, was wet, in consequence of the windows being broken, which let in the rain.(Boswell) ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> was, and all I had to do was say yes. I had always wanted to carry a movie. Now, if I never make another one, I've done this. For the first time, I feel I've done a complete work on film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Patrick for GTPlanet, however, {{was more}} positive, praising {{the quality of}} driving by all participants: [...] "Real drivers showed they could hang with the gamers on their own turf, {{which can only be}} a good thing for both sides moving forward." [...] Lukáš Redl of Medium wrote that it was {{possible}} to construct an audience around the concept of a virtual motor race and noted people approved of it. He wrote that the sim racing industry needed to adapt to a new strategy and put their focus on eSports, [...] "It is actually quite a rare example in eSports as most disciplines are not based on making things as real as possible. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>it</b> is necessary." [...] Writing for Alphr, Curtis Moldrich echoed similar statements and believed the positive consequence of the Vegas eRace was a testament on how Formula E is forward-looking. He felt Formula One would not be able to negotiate all of their drivers into undertaking a similar event. Autosport's Scott Mitchell called the event [...] " an enormous middle finger to the traditionalists", and although he believed another eRace was unlikely to be repeated on a large scale, he wrote it was [...] "huge for a hidden part of motorsport that Formula E has taken that chance" ...|$|E
