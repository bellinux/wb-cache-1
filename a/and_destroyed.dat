With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to threaten Constantinople seriously again.

50|$|There are 3 {{factions in}} Seek <b>and</b> <b>Destroy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Search <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> {{missions}} {{had many}} flaws. First, there was lack of distinction between “clearing” <b>and</b> search <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> missions. Thus “clearing” missions, which were less aggressive, eventually {{morphed into a}} more violent and brutal form of tactic just as search <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> missions were. With the lack of distinction between “clearing” <b>and</b> search <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> missions, pacification was not pushed. Guenter Lewey, a Professor of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, argued that the generals and war planners severely underestimated the enemy’s abilities to match and exceed U.S. forces. Large numbers of Viet Cong troops would be killed or captured, but they were quickly replaced. Although enemy forces were initially pushed out of certain territories, {{as soon as the}} American forces left the areas, they simply returned with more reinforcements and weapons.|$|R

5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted <b>and</b> <b>destroyed</b> Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E

After the computer is dropped <b>and</b> <b>destroyed,</b> the intruder escapes and is revealed to be Sarah, a CIA agent.|$|E
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, <b>and</b> <b>destroyed</b> most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
