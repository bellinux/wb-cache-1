25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. <b>A</b> <b>politics</b> of the poor is understood to mean <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

In his capacity as President of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association (Association des amitiés Franco-Chinoises), he visited the People's Republic of China several times, in order to study new methods of industrial development created by the Cultural Revolution. After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, Bettelheim was very critical of the new leaders (Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping) who began to abandon Maoist principles, and replacing them with <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> of modernization which Bettelheim considered reactionary and authoritarian.|$|E

500|$|Newman {{incorporates}} concepts from post-structuralist thought such as post-humanism and anti-essentialism into classical anarchism. Unlike May, whose post-anarchism is {{a combination}} of the two, Newman attempts to move beyond both anarchism and post-structuralism. He proposes that [...] "by using the poststructuralist critique one can theorize the possibility of political resistance without essentialist guarantees: <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> of postanarchism … by incorporating the moral principles of anarchism with the postructuralist critique of essentialism, {{it may be possible to}} arrive at an ethically workable, politically valid, and genuinely democratic notion of resistance to domination".|$|E
500|$|Smith {{argues that}} Val Plumwood is {{incorrect}} {{to declare the}} resituation of animals into ethical terms as supererogatory {{as opposed to the}} necessary resituation of humans into ecological terms, as the two tasks are linked. Smith rejects the culture/nature dichotomy, and suggests that <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> of recognition is an appropriate way to think about relationships. She draws upon feminist and ecofeminist literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond intersubjective self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond a human self, a concept which she challenges. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "naive" [...] as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode for thinking about ecological and animal injustices.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{creates a}} number of {{binaries}} between men and women. Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), portrays a fundamental binary between {{the male and female}} characters: the female characters act as an elite set of [...] "creators" [...] or [...] "educated, visionary, and predominantly female" [...] characters who provide the facilitation for evolution [...] "in existential terms" [...] of the male [...] "'collectors', whose traits are present in all of Fowles's flawed male protagonists." [...] Though acknowledging such binaries {{in the role of the}} characters, critic Alice Ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements. Rather, the binaries demonstrate what she calls a gendered [...] "scopic politics", or <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> created by a gaze (not dissimilar from the [...] "male gaze" [...] noticed in cinema studies), that constructs an artificial gender binary within Fowle's early novels (as opposed to a multiplicity of socially constructed genders). For Ferrebe, this binary creates a tension, especially with Sarah, who becomes a violently fetishised and objectified [...] "other", differentiated from the male characters like Charles.|$|E

2500|$|Ruskin's social view broadened from {{concerns}} about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by John Stuart Mill, based on theories of laissez-faire and competition drawn {{from the work of}} Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. In his four essays, Unto This Last, Ruskin rejected the division of labour as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the [...] "science" [...] of political economy failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on Plato and Xenophon to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics. For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by <b>a</b> <b>politics</b> of social justice. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the [...] "social economy" [...] characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other non-governmental organisations.|$|E

Anointing provides a radically theological hermeneutic—a theologically robust vision for interpreting medicine that, if enacted, can powerfully make real God 2 ̆ 7 s work in the world. Such a vision is embodied in one particular twentieth-century exemplar—the organization called Partners In Health (PIH) and its cofounder, Paul Farmer. Farmer and PIH, I argue, live the théologie and theological politics of medicine embodied in the practice of anointing. What is more, they show—against those who would accuse such an approach of being naively idealistic—that such <b>a</b> theological <b>politics</b> is possible, powerful, and can even change the world...|$|R
