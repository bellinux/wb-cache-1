5|$|Many {{migrant workers}} have little education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} their rights, and leave home to support their families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> their host countries. The debts they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt {{was educated}} <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> {{the public schools}} of his native state. His family moved to Logan County, Kentucky in 1800, and he {{continued}} his education there. In early adulthood, he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. He then returned to Kentucky to teach in a country school. He invested his income in land purchases, and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain {{him for a few}} years. Financially stable, he resolved to read law under Judge Caleb Wallace. He was admitted to the bar of Russellville, Kentucky in 1810 and opened his practice there.|$|E

She toured the country, watching cooks <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she {{asked if he would}} illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} in the law, Mercer used his {{substantial}} income to support the arts and amassed a large art collection including many pieces by Carl Ahrens, of whom Mercer {{was a close friend}} and admirer. This art collection was auctioned off in 1925 and was found to contain a selection of art, porcelain, sculpture and antique furniture from around the globe. Mercer was also a keen amateur painter himself and was also an excellent sportsman who represented Canada and the Canadian Army in shooting contests both <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|Gale {{served as}} a staff captain at the War Office from 1919 to 1923. Thereafter his inter-war service alternated between regimental duty <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Egypt, and postings to the War Office. He was {{promoted}} to the brevet rank of major in 1921 but was not promoted substantially until 1930. He returned to the War Office in 1928, where he became Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General in 1930. After ten years as a major {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel in 1932. In 1934, he became an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley. He became Assistant Director of Shipping and Transport, War Office and was promoted to colonel in 1937 and then brigadier in 1939.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> their own small businesses. As Song society {{became more and more}} prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As {{proof of}} the {{successful}} revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs {{of old and new}} acts were sold out, both <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> other European countries, where the movement had spread. Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980, embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981, as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US. Def Leppard visited the US {{for the first time in}} 1980 for a three-month trek supporting Pat Travers, Judas Priest, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Sammy Hagar. Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981. NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980, and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events. The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans. In addition to Reading, a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.|$|E

5|$|Given again {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Steve Harper {{during the following}} season. After a 5–0 qualifying round win, Newcastle progressed to the group stages of the Champions League. He played {{in the first three}} group matches, all of which Newcastle lost. Given found himself out of the team for the next two games, as Harper replaced him in goal. Given returned for the final group match against Feyenoord in the Netherlands, and Newcastle's 3–2 win meant that they qualified for the second round. Internazionale scored four times past Given as Newcastle lost 4–1 in their opening match in the second group stage. Newcastle conceded a further three times away to Barcelona, beat Bayer Leverkusen <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Germany (with Given saving an Oliver Neuville penalty in the home tie), and drew with Inter at San Siro, however a 2–0 loss at home against Barcelona meant that the club finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages. Given played every game in the second round. Given played all 38 league games for the club, as well as his 12 European appearances, as the team finished in third place in the Premier League, meaning the club would enter the Champions League qualifying round in 2003–04.|$|E
