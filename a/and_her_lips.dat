25|$|The two {{arrive at}} Ambrose, which is {{virtually}} a ghost town. Unable {{to find an}} attendant at the gas station, they wander into the church, disrupting a funeral. There, they meet a mechanic named Bo, who offers to sell them a fan belt after the funeral. While waiting for the services to end, Carly and Wade visit the 'House of Wax', a wax museum which itself is made of wax and is the central feature of the town. The gas station {{does not have the}} right size fan belt, so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face. Outside, Carly realizes Bo is the one who visited them the night before, after noticing his car's broken headlight. She runs to the church for help, but finds out that it is populated only by wax sculptures. Bo captures Carly and brings her to the cellar of the gas station, where she is restrained <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> are glued. Meanwhile, Vincent strips Wade naked and straps him to a chair, where he is both injected and covered in molten wax.|$|E
60|$|A terrible {{bitterness}} darkened her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> quivered.|$|E
60|$|Tessa's tears had ceased, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were pale with fright.|$|E
60|$|The {{force of}} this, for some reason, did not {{overwhelm}} his wife; <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> curled a little, half in contempt, half in risibility.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Maitre Isaac! Oh yes, sir. We used to {{hear him}} preach at the church, and {{sometimes}} he catechized us,' she said, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> quivered.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she fled}} up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid <b>and</b> Mary at <b>her</b> heels. <b>And</b> <b>her</b> face grew white, too, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> trembled. When {{she reached the}} bedside she gasped out: ...|$|R
60|$|Sadie said nothing, but her pose {{stiffened}} <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> set tight.|$|E
60|$|The anger had gone. She {{was pale}} again, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were trembling.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, her lovely eyes turned pleadingly upwards, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> trembling.|$|E
6000|$|The tears glittered in the girl's eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> trembled; but, {{with all}} her {{readiness}} of speech, she could only say, [...] "Oh, your Excellency." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{face flushed}} a little <b>and</b> brightened, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> relaxed with a smile. [...] "Go 'long with yer! Ye don't {{mean to say}} ye had no luck to-day?" ...|$|R
60|$|Liddy {{assumed a}} smaller physiognomy, <b>and</b> shut <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> decisively.|$|R
60|$|There {{were tears}} in her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> twitched with some strong emotion.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} strangely, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> parted {{in a smile}} which was no smile.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose to her}} feet. She was pale, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were quivering, but she was splendidly handsome.|$|E
60|$|The two {{launches}} {{were still}} sailing side by side, and Eve now {{appeared at the}} open window next the seat of Paul. Her face was pale as when {{the scene of the}} cabin occurred, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> trembled.|$|R
60|$|Florence shook <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{against his}} cheek.|$|R
60|$|Fleur drooped her eyelids; {{turned a}} little pale, <b>and</b> bit <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was a light}} {{tinge of}} irony in her voice, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> showed {{the shadow of a}} smile.|$|E
60|$|Fan glanced timidly at her again, {{her eyes}} brightening, a red colour {{flushing}} her pale cheeks, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> quivering.|$|E
60|$|She met {{his gaze}} without flinching. There {{was a little}} spot of colour in her cheeks, however, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> quivered.|$|E
60|$|I {{leaned forward}} <b>and</b> touched <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> Then I grasped her hands warmly.|$|R
60|$|He drew a {{catching}} breath, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were {{opening to}} his.|$|R
60|$|Kate bowed slightly, <b>and</b> biting <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> turned <b>her</b> head {{towards the}} stage.|$|R
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the bed stood Mother Anastasia clad in her severest gray, her brows knit <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> close pressed.|$|E
60|$|She {{dared not}} look back at her rescuer. Her head was bent, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were murmuring half-audible words as she went.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, {{with her}} open eyes on his--eyes that looked now very blue and very grave, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> a little apart.|$|E
60|$|He {{appeared}} {{overcome with}} horror, <b>and</b> watched <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> intently {{as though in}} fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "At all costs?" [...] she echoed, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{took on a}} curl. [...] "And {{you call}} this egotism {{by the name of}} love! No doubt you are right," [...] she {{continued}} with an irony that stung him, [...] "for love it is--love of yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him silently, still with the blank despair on her face; but then the tears began to fill <b>her</b> blue eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> trembled. The strong man had {{had too much to}} bear that day. He let his head fall beside hers and sobbed.|$|R
60|$|Violet {{stood still}} a moment, a trifle pale in face, and very erect. Then {{she made a}} little gesture, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> trembled.|$|E
60|$|She {{snatched}} the roll from him, and {{as her eyes}} devoured the lines, her face fell in, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> grew pale with anguish.|$|E
60|$|She did not reply. Her {{eyes had}} narrowed a little, as the Colonel's were {{sometimes}} prone to do, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were pressed firmly together.|$|E
60|$|She stood upright again; a tremulous, joyful gravity was in <b>her</b> eyes <b>and</b> on <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the hand}} was tightened, {{or rather the}} two hands, for they were closed {{together}} upon his arm; and his other arm was wound round <b>her</b> waist; <b>and</b> then, in the gloom of the dark colonnade, he pressed her to his bosom, <b>and</b> kissed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> forehead, <b>and</b> then <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> again. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "they have not bribed high enough yet to get from me my treasure--my treasure." ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{her cousin}} could recover, Virginia slid {{down from the}} desk and had come between them. How <b>her</b> eyes shone <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> trembled as she gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten. What a woman she was as she took <b>her</b> cousin's arm <b>and</b> made him a curtsey.|$|R
