Measurements obtained from the field trial, which was conducted at an open-cut mine in South Australia, suggest that the depth of influence for which there is significant and quantifiable improvement with the roller is approximately 2. 1 m below the ground surface and this corresponded to soil stress readings of between 150 and 200 kPa.

Ethnographic home visits provide a mechanism by which teachers can learn to mediate between students' spontaneous home knowledge and formal school concepts. This is a teacher-researcher study in which I assumed both roles. I discuss transformation of {{the teaching and learning}} context resulting from ethnographic home visits conducted by me in the homes of five U. S. Mexican¹ students. Methods of investigation included ethnographic interviews and participant observation. Data sources were field notes, student journal entries, anecdotal data, video tape recordings, and a research journal. Chapter six presents mediation theory as it relates to classroom instruction. Teachers mediate between <b>actual</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> development (AZD) and the proximal <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> development (PZD) in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> proximal development (ZPD) through use of tools including concrete objects, pictures, written and oral language, and other human beings.

S. Mexican is used to distinguish Mexicans residing in the U. S. from Mexicans residing in Mexico.

A total of 44 soil cores were collected and described across a hillslope (approximately 20 hectacres) in southeastern Minnesota within the Major Land Resource Area 105. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, ten piezometers collected water table depths {{every two hours}} continuously throughout the growing season. The hydrologic monitoring of the study site was used to associate water depth and duration of saturation to the soil morphology and stratigraphy. This study's objectives are (1) to describe soil profiles and identify redoximorphic features and link them with <b>actual</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> saturation, (2) develop a landscape model of water table depth across the entire hillslope and (3) determine if predictions of water table elevations can be made using certain attributes (slope, plan curvature and profile curvature) of the landscape along with precipitation data. The soil landscape model is a 3 -dimensional image of how soil stratigraphy and bedrock interact and influence subsurface hydrologic processes. The prediction of water table elevations are shown by an animation of a selection of data that were generated and manipulated using Avizo, a general-purpose visualization, analysis and 3 D reconstruction software. This project is a prelude to a new approach for communicating soil survey information. It {{was found that the}} redoximorphic features found on site were contemporary features that were associated with an active hydrology.

After a mathematical treatment of the model, an overview is given of empirical evidence on continuous and discontinuous change.
