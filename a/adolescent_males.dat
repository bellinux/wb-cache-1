5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in <b>adolescent</b> <b>males</b> and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the devşirme–janissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim <b>adolescent</b> <b>males.</b> These boys would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and conversion.|$|E
25|$|KLS is very rare, {{occurring}} {{at a rate}} of one in 14 million, which limits research into genetic factors. The condition primarily affects <b>adolescent</b> <b>males,</b> though females can also be affected and the age of onset varies. There is no known cure, and there is little evidence supporting drug treatment. Lithium has been reported to have limited effects in case reports, decreasing the length of episodes and duration between them in some patients. Stimulants have been shown to promote wakefulness during episodes, but they do not counteract cognitive symptoms or decrease the duration of episodes. The condition is named after Willi Kleine and Max Levin, who described cases of the disease in the early 20th century. It was added to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the {{evolutionary}} perspective, much of modern history demonstrates higher and lower status roles between two men involved in sexual relations. There is evidence of males seducing each other for social gain as well as sexual pleasure. Examples of this in modern history include Roman Emperors; such as Augustus Caesar, who supposedly acquired the throne {{in part due to}} their sexual relations with their predecessors. Additionally, the ancient Greek custom of pederasty provides additional support for the evolutionary account. It was very common for adult males and <b>adolescent</b> <b>males</b> in ancient Greece, to engage in sexual relations. Similarly to relationships found in early humans who displayed homoeroticism, the relationship dynamic between males involved in pederasty in the ancient Greek period was unequal. These young males also received benefits such as increased social networks and educational development.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore {{ways in which}} <b>adolescent</b> <b>male</b> {{students}} perceive war and violence and related gender discourses. My research is situated in a Year 10 English classroom in a private boys’ school in Perth, Australia. Interviews with students and their teacher provide opportunities to explore perceptions and ideas on issues relating to war and violence. It appears that discourses of violence are closely associated with hegemonic forms of masculinity which specifically exclude females. It also appears that although pedagogical practices do not condone violence, they retain violence in an unquestioned, unchallengeable position in classroom discourses. I found that discourses which challenge war and violence were not always easily accessible to these <b>adolescent</b> <b>male</b> students...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} of low back pain (LBP) in <b>adolescent</b> <b>male</b> rowers. In this study, regional lumbar spinal kinematics and self-reported LBP intensity were compared between 10 adolescent rowers with moderate levels of LBP relating to rowing with 10 reporting no history of LBP during a 15 -minute ergometer trial using an electromagnetic tracking system. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>male</b> rowers with LBP reported increasing pain intensity during ergometer rowing. No significant differences were detected in mean upper or lower lumbar angles between rowers with and without LBP. However, compared to rowers without pain, rowers with pain had: 1) relatively less excursion of the upper lumbar spine into extension over the drive phase, 2) relatively less excursion of the lower lumbar spine into extension over time, 3) greater variability in upper and lower lumbar angles over the 15 -minute ergometer trial, 4) positioned their upper lumbar spine closer to end range flexion for {{a greater proportion of}} the drive phase, and 5) showed increased time in sustained flexion loading in the upper lumbar spine. Differences in regional lumbar kinematics exist between <b>adolescent</b> <b>male</b> rowers with and without LBP, which may have injury implication and intervention strategies...|$|R

A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others.|$|E
500|$|Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 {{were greeted}} by a bouncer who {{inspected}} them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called [...] "Lily Law", [...] "Alice Blue Gown", or [...] "Betty Badge"), visitors {{would have to be}} known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private [...] "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or black lights. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching. In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by [...] "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go. Only a few transvestites, or men in full drag, were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were [...] "98 percent male" [...] but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless <b>adolescent</b> <b>males,</b> who slept in nearby Christopher Park, would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks. The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons. Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as [...] "the gay bar in the city".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} appropriate choral literature for the <b>adolescent</b> <b>male.</b> Historically, scholars have focused on the lowering of the maturing male voice into the newly-formed chest register. During the change process, the male voice is unpredictable and can have a limited range. While a vast amount of repertoire for the <b>adolescent</b> <b>male</b> accommodates this downward progression and anticipates the narrow range, most adolescent boys are, in fact, capable of singing pitches above the chest register. Registers will be identified in this study. Discussion will pertain to registration shifts between chest register, head register, and falsetto in the <b>adolescent</b> <b>male.</b> I will investigate the use of the head register, which is a legitimate and vital component in healthy singing during adolescence. I will then compare registration to the historical knowledge of the male changing voice, which focuses mostly on the range and development of the newly-forming chest register. I will apply the concept of registration to choral repertoire taken from the 2005 and 2007 American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) national convention reading session packets. I will identify music that best and least facilitates the use and mixture of head-register and chest-register singing. Music for treble voices in various combinations (SA, SSA, SSAA, etc.) and three-part mixed music (SAB) will be examined. Each category presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for the <b>adolescent</b> <b>male.</b> Specific musical examples will illustrate the discussion. Careful repertoire selection with registration as a criterion is a key factor in unlocking male singing potential during adolescence. Although boys have unpredictable ranges, as it will be shown, registers are constant...|$|R

2500|$|These stylistic {{innovations}} {{are made}} possible by the iterability of speech, and are used to index elements of identity that often do not conform with the gender binary. [...] Conversely, lesbian women already have a wider variety of speech available, yet refrain from using a distinctive style of speech. Masculinity, and speech associated with a heterosexual male, is constrained by cultural expectations for men to avoid 'Abjection' (as further elaborated in Gender Trouble); power differences amongst the genders may lead to speakers adopting different speech styles that conform with their identities, or expected Gender performances (e.g. <b>adolescent</b> <b>males</b> often use the term 'fag' to police one another, which challenges their sexual orientation through gender performance, and reinforces the avoidance of the 'abject' or femininity.) [...] 'Masculine' speech is associated with non-feminine sounding speech and because some gay men may not wish to identify with straight masculine speech in some contexts, they may access other speech styles to convey their identity (because the possibilities have two options, 'masculine' or 'feminine,' to be not-'masculine' is often associated with 'feminine'). The boundary between 'masculine' and 'feminine' is maintained by cultural norms and societal orders, that do not permit masculinity to include femininity, the abject.|$|E
