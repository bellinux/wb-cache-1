500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian lauded Shakira's originality, opining that [...] "In {{an age of}} personality-free pop idols, Shakira's glorious {{eccentricity}} {{makes her}} a true star," [...] and commented that [...] "Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric {{that it could be}} the work of 1970s rock surrealist Captain Beefheart" [...] and [...] "The music on Laundry Service gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap." [...] Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs [...] "displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier" [...] and that [...] "no one could claim Laundry Service was a groundbreaking work of art," [...] he concluded that [...] "its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service [...] "the Cher album Cher never made" [...] and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the [...] "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Espa√±ol" [...] and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield [...] "results ranging from corking to minging," [...] but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying [...] "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the <b>anti-copying</b> <b>device</b> that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it." ...|$|E
40|$|Document fraud {{including}} unauthorized {{duplication of}} identification cards {{and credit cards}} {{is a serious problem}} facing the government, banks, businesses, and consumers. In addition, counterfeit products such as computer chips, and compact discs, are arriving on our shores in great numbers. With the rapid advances in computers, CCD technology, image processing hardware and software, printers, scanners, and copiers, it is becoming increasingly easy to reproduce pictures, logos, symbols, paper currency, or patterns. These problems have stimulated an interest in research, development and publications in security technology. Some ID cards, credit cards and passports currently use holograms as a security measure to thwart copying. The holograms are inspected by the human eye. In theory, the hologram cannot be reproduced by an unauthorized person using commercially-available optical components; in practice, however, technology has advanced {{to the point where the}} holographic image can be acquired from a credit card-photographed or captured with by a CCD camera-and a new hologram synthesized using commercially-available optical components or hologram-producing equipment. Therefore, a pattern that can be read by a conventional light source and a CCD camera can be reproduced. An optical security and <b>anti-copying</b> <b>device</b> that provides significant security improvements over existing security technology was demonstrated. The system can be applied for security verification of credit cards, passports, and other IDs so that they cannot easily be reproduced. We have used a new scheme of complex phase/amplitude patterns that cannot be seen and cannot be copied by an intensity-sensitive detector such as a CCD camera. A random phase mask is bonded to a primary identification pattern which could also be phase encoded. The pattern could be a fingerprint, a picture of a face, or a signature. The proposed optical processing device is designed to identify both the random phase mask and the primary pattern [1 - 3]. We have demonstrated experimentally an optical processor for security verification of objects, products, and persons. This demonstration is very important to encourage industries to consider the proposed system for research and development...|$|E
