Rochambeau was stricken from the Navy List in 1872 and scrapped in 1874.|$|E

25|$|Samadhi is oneness {{with the}} subject of {{meditation}}. There is no distinction, during the eighth limb of yoga, between the actor of meditation, the act of meditation {{and the subject of}} meditation. Samadhi is that spiritual state when one's mind is so absorbed in whatever it is contemplating on, that the mind loses the sense of its own identity. The thinker, the thought process <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> fuse {{with the subject}} of thought. There is only oneness, samadhi.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them to see a doctor in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they {{had to go back to}} the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not treated fairly, arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E

However, Alan Shucard indicates a possible link to Whitman, and a passage in the fourteenth strophe [...] "with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, / <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of death close-walking {{the other side of}} me, / And I in the middle with companions" [...] (lines 121–123).|$|E

500|$|Despite Shatner's doubts, Nimoy and Bennett {{selected}} a time travel {{story in which}} the Enterprise crew encounters a problem {{that could only be}} fixed by something only available in the present day (the Star Trek characters' past). They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers, or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the rainforests. [...] "But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying people seemed rather gruesome for our light-hearted film, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of our crew taking a 600-year round trip just to bring back a snail darter wasn't all that thrilling," [...] explained Nimoy. The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted. Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend—their song added mystery to the story, and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats".

She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E

In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
