5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency. In the most basic sense, this <b>is</b> the <b>experience</b> of the other's body and, in this sense, it <b>is</b> an <b>experience</b> of [...] "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> modified so that what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> as being the other's experience; in <b>experiencing</b> empathy, what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "my" [...] experience, even though I <b>experience</b> it. Empathy <b>is</b> also {{considered to be the}} condition of intersubjectivity and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.|$|R
30|$|For {{the second}} experiment, having already {{established}} that OT {{can serve as}} a reliable online proxy in healthy participants, we focused more directly on the categorical denials that disownership experiences occur. This time participants were advised as regards the phenomena under investigation and instructed to indicate OT for both ownership and disownership experiences. Again, ownership and disownership <b>were</b> <b>experienced</b> more quickly when stroking was synchronous than when it was not, and the more quickly ownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced</b> the more quickly disownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced.</b> Furthermore, rapidity of onset for both correlated with the experienced strength of the illusions. Thus, consistent with our conjecture, it seems that for standard versions of the RHI ownership and disownership might be intrinsically related: the degree to which ownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the rubber hand, disownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the biological hand. When the OT and the questionnaire data were conjoined, they augmented support for the view that disownership experiences do occur.|$|R
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims <b>are</b> <b>experiencing.</b> She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E

If the coefficient of output elasticity is greater than 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> increasing returns to scale. If the coefficient is less than 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> decreasing returns to scale. If the coefficient is 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> constant returns to scale. Note that returns to scale may change as the level of production changes.|$|R

Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{areas in}} South Dakota <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> a trend of falling populations, despite an overall {{increase}} in population. The effect of rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population. In fact, Lincoln County, near Sioux Falls, is the ninth fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state, and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E

5|$|The Congress Street Bridge was on Connecticut Historical Commission's list of bridges. Local {{businesses}} and residents {{have claimed that}} <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> reductions in traffic {{as a result of}} the closure of the bridge and that it has increased emergency response times. In 2002, Bridgeport's official historian, Charles W. Brilvitch, stated that the City of Bridgeport promised P. T. Barnum to keep the bridge open and free, forever. The promise was made when the city purchased the previous bridge from Barnum and annexed East Bridgeport in 1864. However, limited funds became a concern, with the money needing to be directed to more important projects.|$|E
5|$|WHO has {{set out a}} {{strategy}} for traditional medicines with four objectives: to integrate them as policy into national healthcare systems; to provide knowledge and guidance on their safety, efficay, and quality; to increase their availability and affordability; and to promote their rational, therapeutically sound usage. WHO notes in the strategy that countries <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> seven challenges to such implementation, namely in developing and enforcing policy; in integration; in safety and quality, especially in assessment of products and qualification of practitioners; in controlling advertising; in research and development; in education and training; and in the sharing of information.|$|E

5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
5|$|The Himalayas {{and other}} {{mountain}} chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions. An estimated 15,000 glaciers {{can be found}} in the greater Himalayas, with double that number in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram and Tien Shan ranges, and comprise the largest glaciated region outside the poles. These glaciers provide critical water supplies to arid countries such as Mongolia, western China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> a decline in mass, and researchers claim that between the early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9percent reduction in ice mass. Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). If the present trends persist the ice mass will gradually be reduced, and will affect the availability of water resources, though water loss is not expected to cause problems for many decades.|$|E

5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} populations <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> rapid declines. Overland migration as {{a biological}} process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they <b>are</b> <b>experiencing.</b> Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond <b>are</b> <b>experiencing</b> is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E
