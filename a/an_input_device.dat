The Typhoon mouse uses 6-byte packets which can {{appear as a}} sequence of two standard 3-byte packets, such that an ordinary PS/2 driver can handle them. For 3-D (or 6-degree-of-freedom) input, vendors have made many extensions both to the hardware and to software. In the late 1990s, Logitech created ultrasound based tracking which gave 3D input to a few millimeters accuracy, which worked well as <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>device</b> but failed as a profitable product. In 2008, Motion4U introduced its [...] "OptiBurst" [...] system using IR tracking {{for use as a}} Maya (graphics software) plugin.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{projects}} like the Whirlwind and SAGE Projects introduced the CRT {{as a viable}} display and interaction interface and introduced the light pen as <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>device.</b> Douglas T. Ross of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in [...] which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope. One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics – Tennis for Two – was created for an oscilloscope by William Higinbotham to entertain visitors in 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory and simulated a tennis match. In 1959, Douglas T. Ross innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated machine tool vectors, and {{took the opportunity to}} create a display scope image of a Disney cartoon character.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a system to}} track and {{recognize}} hand motion in nearly real time. An important application of this system is to simulate mouse as <b>a</b> visual <b>inputting</b> <b>device.</b> Tracking approach is based on Condensation algorithm, and active shape model. Our contribution is combining multi-modal templates to increase the tracking performance. Weighting value {{is given to the}} sampling ratio of Condensation by applying the prior property of the templates. The recognition approach is based on HMM. Experiments show our system is very promising to work as <b>an</b> auxiliary <b>inputting</b> <b>device.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|OMR is {{now used}} as <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>device</b> for data entry.

The use of punch cards {{declined}} greatly in the early 1970s {{with the introduction of}} personal computers.
