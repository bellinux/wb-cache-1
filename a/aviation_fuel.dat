5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning <b>aviation</b> <b>fuel</b> proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E

40|$|Alternative <b>aviation</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} recently to partially replace the limited resources of traditional liquid <b>fuels</b> in the <b>aviation</b> industry. The fire-safety properties of these fuels, however, are unknown. Especially, the flammability limit of a fuel is a crucial parameter. The present work focuses on measurements of concentration and temperature flammability limits of four pure hydrocarbon fuels, as well as traditional and alternative <b>aviation</b> <b>fuels,</b> including Jet-A, HEFA, SIP, and FT-S 8. The lower and upper concentration flammability limits of these selected fuels were determined under specific temperatures and pressures. An experiment including a customized power supply system to generate sufficient spark energy for ignition near the flammability limits was built to measure the lower and upper limits. The temperature flammability limits were also measured using a different experimental apparatus for the four selected <b>aviation</b> <b>fuels.</b> As the initial temperature increases, the lower concentration flammability limit decreases. In terms of the fuel-air mass ratio, the limit is {{within the range of}} 0. 032 - 0. 04 for all four <b>aviation</b> <b>fuels.</b> The upper flammability limit increases with temperature within a range of 0. 21 - 0. 23 except for SIP. Unlike temperature, pressure has minor influence on the lower concentration flammability limit for all fuels. Among the four <b>aviation</b> <b>fuels,</b> Jet-A and HEFA have similar results, and FT-S 8 is considered to be least sensitive with temperature variation. Three correlations and models were used to predict the lower concentration flammability limits of the four pure fuels. The predictions were compared to the measurements. As for temperature flammability limits, SIP has the highest lower temperature flammability limit. From this perspective, SIP can be considered a better choice for alternative <b>aviation</b> <b>fuels</b> for safer storage and transportation during ground operations. HEFA has similar results as Jet-A, while FT-S 8 has smaller lower temperature flammability limit than Jet-A and HEFA. ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of <b>aviation</b> <b>fuel.</b> At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E
5|$|In October, the Japanese again {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering {{the troops and}} their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling {{the approach of the}} transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available <b>aviation</b> <b>fuel.</b> In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{first major}} refit started in December 1967 and {{continued}} until February 1969, {{during which she}} was upgraded to operate S-2 Tracker and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for <b>aviation</b> <b>fuel</b> and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E
5|$|The Nimitz-class {{aircraft}} carriers {{were ordered to}} supplement the {{aircraft carriers}} of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned. The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft carriers, in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although {{the arrangement of the}} ships is relatively {{similar to that of the}} Kitty Hawk class. Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class carriers take up less space than the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class carriers can carry 90% more <b>aviation</b> <b>fuel</b> and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of <b>aviation</b> <b>fuel</b> and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E

5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. <b>Aviation</b> <b>fuel</b> supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
