5|$|By mid-March, <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{stimulus}} package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, {{who had been}} criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the {{stimulus package}} was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, while {{residing}} at his Wappocomo residence, Casey {{purchased a}} freed slave named John, {{who had been}} residing in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Virginia residents Francis McGuire, Baldwin Parsons, and Absalom Wells seized John and transported him to Virginia, where they sold him back into slavery to Casey. Such an act was illegal in Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society petitioned Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin to demand punishment of the three men by the Governor of Virginia. Virginia's governor refused, citing the absence of <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution calling for such an action. Governor Mifflin petitioned the United States Congress, and a bill was introduced that provided against such an occurrence.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of arms or seal has {{generally}} been authorized by <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state constitution or a legislative act. In most instances a committee (more often than not consisting of three members) was appointed to study the issue, seek advice from qualified artists, historians, legal scholars, etc., and report back to the authorizing legislative body with a design for their approval. Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E
5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E
5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives {{for the prevention of}} disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E

5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having {{to abide by the}} regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel {{was heavily}} struck during its 30-year run, except during {{economic}} downturns in 1885–1886 and in 1894, when only small numbers were struck. In 1890, Congress ended {{production of the}} three-cent piece, leaving the five-cent coin as {{the only one in}} copper nickel. That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the redesign of United States coins, if the former design had been struck for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter act made them eligible for immediate redesign. In 1896, pattern nickels were struck {{for the first time since}} 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested; however, no redesign took place.|$|E

5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation.

No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. Two specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault in 1970 and were destroyed, but rumors and speculation about others in illegal private possession continue to appear from time to time. The issue has also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars resulting in an altered date.|$|E
5|$|Foxgrover {{remained}} {{involved in}} the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke {{in favor of the}} restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any questions for the Park District, she will be the point person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. <b>A</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley and his partners asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA Radio to conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose Clear Channel over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E
