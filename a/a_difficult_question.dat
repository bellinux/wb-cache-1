25|$|The group {{travels to}} the Bridge of Death, where each knight must answer three {{questions}} from the bridge-keeper before proceeding. Lancelot easily answers his questions and crosses the bridge. Robin is confounded by <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question,</b> while Galahad gives a wrong answer to an easy one; both are hurled into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Arthur responds to the bridge-keeper's question with a question, and the bridge-keeper is thrown into the chasm for not knowing the answer.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question</b> is if domesticated {{horses were}} first ridden or driven. While the most unequivocal {{evidence}} shows horses first {{being used to}} pull chariots in warfare, there is strong, though indirect, evidence for riding occurring first, particularly by the Botai. Bit wear may correlate to riding, though, as the modern hackamore demonstrates, horses can be ridden without a bit by using rope and other evanescent materials to make equipment that fastens around the nose. So the absence of unequivocal evidence of early riding in the record does not settle the question.|$|E
25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} is {{a psychological}} process thought to underlie {{a number of}} cognitive biases and perceptual illusions. It occurs when an individual {{has to make a}} judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute. This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system. Hence, when someone tries to answer <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question,</b> they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place. This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show regression toward the mean.|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{continued}} his provocative approach to journalism, and {{on more than}} one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the Lebanon War, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Bradby, then the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was told it was [...] "disrespectful". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question</b> on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that [...] "I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions." [...] Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup [...] "stage management", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.|$|E
500|$|When Greenfield {{was asked}} <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question</b> in the legislature, he often {{leaned over to}} Brownlee, his seatmate, who {{supplied}} him with an answer {{in full view of}} the legislature. Many UFA members found this practice humiliating. [...] Brownlee's importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922. Brownlee was on vacation in Victoria during a special sitting of the legislature. While his presence was usually considered crucial, the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial, and passed by a large margin. However, once this item was dispensed with, some members complained that the C$100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low. Greenfield brought a motion to double it; the amount was increased to $250 in committee. At a time when many farmers earned less than $250 per year, the move cost the UFA dearly in the eyes of its supporters. [...] Many UFA MLAs privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had Brownlee been present. [...] On another occasion, in 1924, Brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness. Boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy, since the Liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence. While Brownlee appreciated the gesture, all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman.|$|E
2500|$|Ernst Risch lost {{no time in}} {{proposing that}} there was never more than one migration, which brought proto-Greek into Greece. Proto-Greek is the assumed last common {{ancestor}} of all known varieties of Greek and then dissimilated into dialects within Greece. [...] Meanwhile, the linguists closest to the decipherment were having doubts about the classification of proto-Greek. John Chadwick summarizing in 1976 wrote:"Let us therefore explore the alternative view. This hypothesis is that the Greek language did not exist before the twentieth century B.C., but was formed in Greece by the mixture of an indigenous population with invaders who spoke another language .... What this language was is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question</b> ... the exact stage reached in development {{at the time of}} the arrival is difficult to predict." ...|$|E

2500|$|That is such <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>question.</b> There {{are times}} when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an {{extraordinary}} gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
