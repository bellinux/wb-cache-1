5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot. Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to <b>allow</b> <b>his</b> father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'Ã©tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not <b>allow</b> <b>his</b> ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond III's {{younger son}} (Raymund-Roupen's uncle), Bohemond, Count of Tripoli, disputed the {{validity}} of their oath.

Three months later Leo invaded the Principality of Antioch, forcing the younger Bohemond to <b>allow</b> <b>his</b> father to return to Antioch. Pope Innocent III also supported the restoration of BohemondIII in Antioch, but, responding to the Templars' demand, he also began urging Leo to restore Bagras to them.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} of a former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward's son, Edward II, Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to <b>allow</b> <b>his</b> return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Licence to Kill {{was also}} adapted as a forty-four page, colour graphic novel, by writer and artist Mike Grell (also author of original-story Bond comic books), {{published}} by Eclipse Comics and ACME Press in hardcover and trade editions in 1989.

5|$|On 22 September the German battle {{group in}} Norway was {{attacked}} by several British midget submarines.

It was Sangams lead actor, Raj Kapoor, who requested Ganesan to <b>allow</b> <b>his</b> film to continue running at Shanti, to which Ganesan obliged.

5|$|Ralph de Luffa (or Ralph Luffa (died 1123) was an English {{bishop of}} Chichester, from 1091 to 1123.

5|$|Since {{this was}} to be a {{full-scale}} invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. It was decided that Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges were to be set up to <b>allow</b> <b>his</b> army to cross the Hellespont to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.|$|E

With this new talent, in his first season in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this as a springboard to take the Southern League title in 1908â09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.|$|E
