25|$|On June 19, 2008, Konami {{released}} the Metal Gear Solid 4 Database onto the PlayStation Store in North America and Japan, and {{one week later}} on the European store. The Database is a downloadable application for PlayStation 3 that catalogues every piece of Metal Gear lore from all the canonical entries in the series released up to Metal Gear Solid 4 {{in the form of}} an encyclopedia (browsable by alphabet and category), a timeline, and character relationship diagrams. Highlighted words in each article link to related articles, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> track of which ones the user has already read. The Database automatically locks any items related to MGS4, in order to prevent the leaking of spoilers to players who have not completed the game yet. In order to reveal these articles, the user must have a completed MGS4 game save that was created on the same console and with a version of the game from the same region as their account.|$|E
500|$|Spoonheim was {{originally}} from Rudyard, Montana, where her family owned an auto supply store. [...] She began {{playing the piano}} at age five, when her mother would drive her on an [...] round [...] trip to Havre to take classical piano lessons. [...] By the age of 12, she was playing with adults in a dance band, earning $10 per night. She began singing as well as playing the piano during a {{time in her life}} when she lived in Billings, Montana. She was a 28-year-old divorced single mother of three when she started working as the Sip 'n Dip's piano player in 1963, taking the position as a second job in order to support her children. [...] She simultaneously worked as a medical transcriptionist for 38 years before retiring from her day job in 2000. [...] She celebrated 50 years of employment at the Sip 'n Dip in December 2013 and at that time she was featured on CBS Sunday Morning. [...] She has released two albums, only for sale at the Sip 'n Dip, and though she takes requests, she refuses to play modern rock music. She continues to work because it is not only a job but also her social life, [...] "It's a chance {{to get out of the}} house. I enjoy the lounge, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> me going." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{prominent}} Palestinians rejoiced at the news, {{believing it}} would give them increased legitimacy and Israel decreased credibility {{in the international arena}} and among its own allies. Similarly, Thomas Friedman observed: [...] "From Iran’s point of view, it makes fantastic TV on Al Jazeera, and all the European networks; it undermines Israel’s legitimacy with the young generation on college campuses around the globe; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> the whole world much more focused on Israeli civil rights abuses against Palestinians rather than the massive civil rights abuses perpetrated by the Iranian regime against its own people. It is stunning how much Bibi’s actions serve Tehran’s strategic interests." ...|$|E

2500|$|The article {{continues}} in the explanation of these facts: [...] "Prof. Élie Metchnikoff gave to the world {{the result of his}} investigation on the subject of longevity in which he held that the chief enemy to long life in the human species the large intestine, or colon. This organ by becoming the breeding place for poisonous microbes, the fertile cause for the debility that comes with old age, and the death that cuts off many a career of normal course is not nearly run." [...] "Acids are the best antiseptics; they have been used from time immemorial as preservatives; pickles are persevered with vinegar, acidic acid, and when milk is allowed to sour under proper conditions, the germs of putrefaction are destroyed or their activity inhibited, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> a considerable time. How can acids be applied so as to control the bacterial flora of the large intestine? Not in the ordinary way because, when administered through the mouth, they are used up long before they can penetrate the colon. The brilliant idea occurred to Prof. Metchnikoff of the administering acid-producing germs which might work their way through the digestive system, and, reaching the large intestine, produce the acid required. After much experimenting, the bacillus of Massol, Bacillus Bulgaricus was adopted as the most suitable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hassam {{had moved}} to France to study figure drawing and {{painting}} at the prestigious Académie Julian. He {{took advantage of the}} formal drawing classes with Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre, but quickly moved on to self-study, finding that [...] "he Julian academy is the personification of routine... crushes all originality out of growing men. It tends to put them in a rut <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> them in it", preferring instead, [...] "my own method in the same degree". His first Parisian works were street scenes, employing a mostly brown palette. He sent these works back to Boston and their sale, combined with that of older watercolors, provided him with sufficient income to sustain his stay abroad. In the autumn of 1887, Hassam painted two versions of Grand Prix Day, employing a breakthrough change of palette. In this dramatic change of technique, he was laying softer, more diffuse colors to canvas, similar to the French Impressionists, creating scenes full of light, done with freer brush strokes. He was likely inspired by French Impressionist paintings which he viewed in museums and exhibitions, though he did not meet any of the artists. Hassam eventually became one of the group of American Impressionists known as [...] "The Ten".|$|E
