2500|$|The Economic Cooperation Foundation, {{which is}} funded by the European Union, agreed to {{purchase}} the greenhouses for $14 million and transfer ownership to the Palestinian Authority, so that the 4,000 Palestinians employed to work in them could keep their jobs.The money was paid for the greenhouse guts, such as the computerized irrigation systems, as the law in Israel only allowed {{for the government to}} pay for the land and structures, as these are not moveable. Israel compensated the evacuees 55 million dollars for the greenhouses and the land. Former head of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, contributed $500,000 of his own money to the project.
