Bodhisattvas are beings which {{have chosen to}} work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> {{to that of the}} Arhat because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings. A Bodhisattva is one who arouses a powerful emotion called Bodhicitta (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening of oneself and all beings.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the soundtrack}} album were more {{favorable}} {{than for the}} film. Indeed, writing for Film Score Monthly, AK Benjamin says that [...] "on a CD, Small's material fares better since it's not accompanied by the film." [...] Dismissing the film as [...] "engagingly unwatchable", he says that [...] "Small certainly gave Revenge {{a lot more than}} it deserved– and this a much better score than Deep Blue Sea... whatever that means." [...] Benjamin portrays Small as 'knowing' and his work <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> to the film.|$|E

The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak thought that the use of a full band was a [...] "retread" [...] of the songs Carey recorded for her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005).

500|$|In 1784 Nock finally {{became a}} Freeman of the Gunmakers Company. [...] A {{few years later}} the French Revolution and the {{subsequent}} Napoleonic Wars ensured that Nock was not short of government business. [...] The Duke of Richmond preferred Nock over his competitors for his innovations, particularly the screwless lock. [...] Nock began delivering muskets in 1792 but orders for the regular army dried up because Nock's non-standard design took too long to make and used a different calibre ammunition. [...] Thereafter Nock concentrated on supplying muskets to local militia preparing for an expected invasion. In 1804 the government placed a contract with Nock to replace all the Nock locks on their stock of Duke of Richmond pattern muskets with standard ones. [...] Although the Nock locks were recognised <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior,</b> the need for standardisation took precedence.|$|E

Philippa Irving of Crash criticised the graphics as repetitively [...] "dull", despite admitting that they were [...] "clear enough" [...] visually. Gary Rook of Sinclair User heralded the graphics as [...] "superb", adding that the game {{was one of the}} [...] "best looking" [...] wargames he had ever seen at that time. A reviewer of Computer and Video Games criticised the presentation, stating that the screen was too small and the lack of visual understanding made the game [...] "completely unplayable". Mark Reed of Computer Gamer praised the graphics <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> compared to Theatre Europe, heralding it as [...] "much more detailed". However, Reed criticised the originality of the game and the lack of manual for the ZX Spectrum version.|$|E

This system, which unambiguously treats poetry composed during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (the [...] "High Tang" [...] period) <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> in quality to what came before and after, is subjective and evaluative, and often does not reflect the realities of literary history.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{commercial}} and critical failure, Introducing Sparks faded into obscurity. This was rectified in November 2007, when {{the album was}} officially re-released on CD on Sparks own record label; Lil' Beethoven Records. However, the CD was not remastered from the original studio master tapes owned by Sony, but was mastered from a vinyl LP. When the album was later re-released again in Japan on SHM-CD, which is marketed <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a <b>superior</b> sounding CD format, the same vinyl remaster was used.|$|R

[...] Abu Yusuf was chief jurist for Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, for whom he wrote the [...] Book of Taxation (Kitab al-Kharaj). [...] This book outlined Abu Yusuf's ideas on taxation, public finance, and agricultural production. [...] He discussed proportional tax on produce instead of fixed taxes on property <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> as an incentive to bring more land into cultivation. [...] He also advocated forgiving tax policies which favor the producer and a centralized tax administration to reduce corruption. [...] Abu Yusuf favored the use of tax revenues for socioeconomic infrastructure, and included discussion of various types of taxes, including sales tax, death taxes, and import tariffs.|$|E
2500|$|In his School Edict Julian {{required}} that all public teachers {{be approved by}} the Emperor; the state paid or supplemented much of their salaries. Ammianus Marcellinus explains this as intending to prevent Christian teachers from using pagan texts (such as the Iliad, which was widely regarded as divinely inspired) that formed the core of classical education: [...] "If they want to learn literature, they have Luke and Mark: Let them go back to their churches and expound on them", the edict says. This was an attempt to remove some {{of the power of the}} Christian schools which at that time and later used ancient Greek literature in their teachings in their effort to present the Christian religion <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> to paganism. [...] The edict was also a severe financial blow, because it deprived Christian scholars, tutors and teachers of many students.|$|E
2500|$|Childfreedom may {{no longer}} be {{considered}} the 'best' way to be feminist. Once a paragon of second-wave feminism, the nullipara (childless or childfree woman) is not typically described in third-wave feminism <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> to, or more feminist than, women who choose to have children. Feminist author Daphne DeMarneffe links larger feminist issues to both the devaluation of motherhood in contemporary society, as well as the delegitimization of [...] "maternal desire" [...] and pleasure in motherhood. In third-wave handbook Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future, authors Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards explore the concept of third-wave feminists reclaiming [...] "girlie" [...] culture, along with reasons why women of Baby Boomer and Generation X ages may reject motherhood because, at a young and impressionable age, they witnessed their own mothers being devalued by society and family.|$|E

The features of Crohn's disease are well described by barium follow-through examinations, appearing as a typical [...] "cobblestone pattern", but no information is obtained regarding extraluminal disease. Radiographic imaging in Crohn's disease provides clinicians with objective evaluations of small bowel regions that are not accessible to standard endoscopic techniques. Because of its length and complex loops, the small intestine is {{the most difficult part of}} the gastrointestinal tract to evaluate.

In a speech given in 1835 titled [...] "Permanent Traits of the English National Genius", he said, [...] "The {{inhabitants}} of the United States, especially of the Northern portion, are descended from the people of England and have inherited the traits of their national character". He saw direct ties between race based on national identity and the inherent nature of the human being. White Americans who were native-born in the United States and of English ancestry were categorized by him as a separate [...] "race", which he thought had a position of being superior to other nations. His idea of race was based more on a shared culture, environment, and history than on scientific traits that modern science defines as race. He believed that native-born Americans of English descent were superior to European immigrants, including the Irish, French, and Germans, and also <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> to English people from England, whom he considered a close second and the only really comparable group.|$|E
2500|$|The Church of Christ {{rejects the}} Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, {{as well as}} Joseph Smith's [...] "Inspired Version" [...] of the Bible, preferring to use only the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon as doctrinal standards. The Book of Commandments is {{accepted}} <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>superior</b> to the Doctrine and Covenants as a compendium of Smith's early revelations (due to changes effected in many Doctrine and Covenants sections that had earlier been printed in the Book of Commandments), but is not accorded the same status as the Bible or Book of Mormon. The Temple Lot church publishes its own edition of the Book of Mormon, identical in chaptering and versification to versions printed by the Community of Christ. [...] "The Word of the Lord", used by the Fettingite and Elijah Message organizations, which broke off from the Temple Lot church, is rejected; however, the Temple Lot church maintains an openeness {{to the idea that}} revelation might conceivably come to any member of the church at any time, whether male or female, holder of the priesthood or not.|$|E

Mill also acknowledges that [...] "many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher." [...] Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for {{there is no other way}} of measuring [...] "the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations." [...] "It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect." ...|$|E
