40|$|Swelling is an {{inevitable}} phenomenon in intercalation type anodes such as graphite {{due to the}} expansion of its crystalline lattice during lithiation. The stress accumulation due to anode swelling upon cycling would lead to the deterioration of discharging capacities as well as cell thickening in commercial lithium ion batteries. To suppress cell thickening, a novel asymmetric electrode is designed, so that the electrode thicknesses on the opposite sides of the current collector differ from each other. A series of thickness ratios (1. 00, 1. 05, 1. 10 and 1. 15) was prepared, and the thicker side of the <b>anode</b> <b>film</b> was wound inwardly. Upon cycle testing, the group with a thickness ratio of 1. 05 showed the highest consistency in capacity retention ratio and the least swelling.

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are of {{increasing}} interest as low emission, high efficiency, energy conversion devices {{for the production}} of electricity, and in some cases heat, {{from a wide range of}} fuels. In general, a porous cermet of nickel/ytrria-stabilized-zirconia (Ni/YSZ) is used as an anode with a dense electrolyte of ytrria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), enabling operation at temperatures above around 750 oC. Nevertheless, operating at high temperature leads to various problems such as metal corrosion, electrode sintering, and unwanted interfacial diffusion in the cell. In this regard, cermet anodes such as nickel/samarium-doped-ceria (Ni/SDC) and nickel/gadolinium-doped-ceria (Ni/CGO) have been proposed as alternative anodes to be operated with SDC and CGO electrolytes at intermediate temperatures (< 700 oC), respectively. However, less attention has been given to nickel/scandia-stabilized-zirconia (Ni/ScSZ) cermet anodes as alternatives for intermediate temperature SOFCs, despite the fact that the ScSZ electrolyte exhibits a higher ionic conductivity compared to other zirconia electrolytes, which may offer some advantages, especially at lower temperature. Furthermore, Ni/ScSZ anodes have shown improved tolerance towards carbon deposition and sulphur poisoning in addition to improved durability when compared to Ni/YSZ anodes. To date there have only been limited studies into the relationship between the materials used, the processing conditions, and the properties and performance of Ni/ScSZ anodes.

A noble roll‐to‐roll cohesive coating system utilizes only natural gravity and the surface tension of the solution to flow out from the capillary {{to the surface of the}} substrate. Because this mechanism uses a minimally cohesive solution, the roll‐to‐roll cohesive coating can effectively realize an ultra‐thin film thickness for the electron injection layer. In addition, the roll‐to‐roll cohesive coating enables the fabrication of a thicker polymer <b>anode</b> <b>film</b> more than 250 nm at one time by modification of the surface energy and without wasting the solution. It is observed that the standard sheet resistance deviation of the polymer anode is only 2. 32 Ω/□ over 50 000 bending cycles. The standard sheet resistance deviation of the polymer anode in the different bending angles (0 to 180 °) is 0. 313 Ω/□, but the case of the ITO‐PET is 104. 93 Ω/□. The average surface roughness of the polymer anode measured by atomic force microscopy is only 1. 06 nm. Because the surface of the polymer anode has a better quality, the leakage current of the polymer light‐emitting diodes (PLEDs) using the polymer anode is much lower than that using the ITO‐PET substrate. The luminous power efficiency of the two devices is 4. 13 lm/W for the polymer anode and 3. 21 lm/W for the ITO‐PET. Consequently, the PLEDs made by using the polymer anode exhibited 28 % enhanced performance because the polymer anode represents not only a higher transparency than the ITO‐PET in the wavelength of 560 nm but also greatly reduced roughness. The optimized the maximum current efficiency and power efficiency of the device show around 6. 1 cd/A and 5. 1 lm/W, respectively, which is comparable to the case of using the ITO‐glass. This roll‐to‐roll cohesive coating method utilizes only the natural gravity and cohesive force of the solutions. The coating film thickness can be effectively reduced for the ultra‐thin electron injection layer. Furthermore, the roll‐to‐roll cohesive coating enables the fabrication of a thicker polymer anode more than 250 nm at one time by modification of the surface energy and without wasting the solution...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{experiments}} {{involving the}} electrochemical combustion of humic acid (HA) and removal of algae from pond water. An electrochemical flow reactor with a boron-doped diamond <b>film</b> <b>anode</b> was used and constant current experiments {{were conducted in}} batch recirculation mode. The mass transfer characteristics of the electrochemical device were determined by voltammetric experiments in the potential region of water stability, followed by a controlled current experiment in the potential region of oxygen evolution. The average mass transfer coefficient was 5. 2 x 10 (- 5) m s(- 1). The pond water was then processed to remove HA and algae in {{the conditions in which}} the reaction combustion occurred under mass transfer control. To this end, the mass transfer coefficient was used to estimate the initial limiting current density applied in the electrolytic experiments. As expected, all the parameters analyzed here-solution absorbance at 270 nm, total phenol concentration and total organic carbon concentration-decayed according to first-order kinetics. Since the diamond <b>film</b> <b>anode</b> successfully incinerated organic matter, the electrochemical system proved to be predictable and programmable...|$|R

40|$|An Mg {{film was}} coated {{on one side}} of an Mg- 9 wt. %Al- 1 wt. %Zn (AZ 91 D) sample to form a {{galvanic}} couple in NaCl aqueous solution. The sacrificial Mg <b>film</b> <b>anode</b> cathodically protected the AZ 91 D substrate, because the mixed potential of the Mg coating/AZ 91 D couple was more anodic than the corrosion potential of the substrate.

40|$|The {{immiscible}} Al-Sn alloy {{thin films}} prepared by electron-beam deposition were first investigated as possible negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries. In the complex {{structure of the}} Al-Sn thin films, tiny Sn particles dispersed homogeneously in the Al active matrix. Their electrochemical characteristics were tested {{in comparison with the}} pure Al and Sn films. Cyclic voltammetry results indicated that the Li+-transport rates in these Al-Sn alloy films were significantly enhanced. Charge-discharge tests showed that the Al-Sn alloy <b>film</b> <b>anodes</b> had good cycle performance. The electrode with high Al content (Al- 33 wt%Sn) delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 752 mAh g- 1 while the electrode with high Sn content (Al- 64 wt%Sn) had better cycleability with a stable specific capacity of about 300 mAh g- 1 under 0. 8 C rate. The good performance of these immiscible Al-Sn alloy <b>film</b> <b>anodes</b> was attributed to their unique microstructure. The mechanism of lithiation and delithiation reaction had been proposed based on cyclic voltammograms and impedance response of the Al-Sn alloy thin film electrodes. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the Al-Sn immiscible alloy is a potential candidate negative material for Li-ion battery. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract. Anodic oxide {{films were}} formed on {{titanium}} using an electrolyte solution containing phosphoric acid for dental implants by an electrochemical method. The {{parameters of the}} oxidation process were current density and electrolyte concentration. The micro structural morphology, surface roughness, thickness of the oxide layer and the behavior of voltage-time curves were examined. The {{results show that the}} surface roughness, porosity size and the thickness of the oxide layer showed similar trends as the process parameters were changed. The surface morphology of the samples was observed for different current densities at a constant electrolyte concentration. The pore size, thickness and roughness of the anodic oxide films are directly proportional to the maximum voltage and the slope of the voltage to time transient (dV/dt) curves during the growth of the galvanostatic <b>anode</b> oxide <b>film</b> on plate type Ti...|$|R
