25|$|Mortality {{rates have}} been well {{observed}} in birds; there have been instances where no young have survived to adulthood in areas with high fire ant density. Many birds including <b>cliff</b> nesting <b>swallows,</b> ducks, egrets, quail, and terns {{have been affected by}} red imported fire ants. Ground nesting birds, particularly the least tern (Sterna antillarum), are vulnerable to fire ant attacks. The impact of red imported fire ants on colonial breeding birds is especially severe; waterbirds can experience a mortality rate of 100%, although this factor was lower for early-nesting birds. Brood survival decreases in <b>American</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) if they are exposed to foraging workers. Songbird nest survival decreases in areas with red imported fire ants present, but survival rates in white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) nests increase from 10% to 31% and 7% to 13% whenever fire ants are not present or when they are unable to attack them. Red imported fire ants may indirectly contribute to low brood survival in the Attwater's prairie chicken. It was first thought that the ants were linked to the decline of overwintering birds such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), but a later study showed that ant eradication efforts using the pesticide Mirex, which was known to have toxic side effects, was largely to blame.|$|R

40|$|<b>Cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) nesting in colonies on {{man-made}} structures {{can cause}} aesthetic problems and health hazards. <b>Cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> are migratory, wintering in South America and breeding {{throughout most of}} North America. <b>Cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> have a homing tendency to old colonies and are attracted to the gourd-shaped mud nests.

40|$|Determining {{the effect}} of an {{invasive}} species on enzootic pathogen dynamics is critical for understanding both human epidemics and wildlife epizootics. Theoretical models suggest that when a naive species enters an established host–parasite system, the new host may either reduce (‘dilute’) or increase (‘spillback’) pathogen transmission to native hosts. There are few empirical data to evaluate these possibilities, especially for animal pathogens. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is enzootically transmitted by the swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) to colonially nesting <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota). In western Nebraska, introduced house sparrows (Passer domesticus) invaded <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> colonies approximately 40 years ago and were exposed to BCRV. We evaluated how the addition of house sparrows to this host–parasite system affected the prevalence and amplification of a bird-associated BCRV lineage. The infection prevalence in house sparrows was eight times that of <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows.</b> Nestling house sparrows in mixed-species colonies were {{significantly less likely to}} be infected than sparrows in single-species colonies. Infected house sparrows circulated BCRV at higher viraemia titres than <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows.</b> BCRV detected in bug vectors at a site was positively associated with virus prevalence in house sparrows but not with virus prevalence in <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows.</b> The addition of a highly susceptible invasive host species has led to perennial BCRV epizootics at <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> colony sites. The native <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> host confers a dilution advantage to invasive sparrow hosts in mixed colonies, while at the same sites house sparrows may increase the likelihood that swallows become infected...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) are {{migratory birds}} that {{frequently}} nest on highway structures, such as bridges. Because <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> {{are protected by}} the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, nesting control methods must not harm <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> or disturb active nests. This can cause delays for maintenance divisions of state departments of transportation, resulting in additional cost. In a multiyear project, we evaluated the effects of bioacoustic deterrents and bridge surface modifications on nesting behavior of <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows.</b> We used <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> alarm and distress calls as bioacoustic deterrents (hereafter, broadcast calls [BC]) because they previously had been shown to delay the onset of nesting. We used low-friction plastic sheeting (PTFE, commonly called by its trade name, Teflon®) and silicone-based paint for bridge surface modification. In 2007, swallows were able to complete nests on silicone paint, but did not successfully complete any nests on PTFE. In 2008, PTFE+BC treatment significantly reduced nesting compared with no treatment, although some nests were completed at PTFE and PTFE+BC sites on the bare concrete next to the sheeting or at locations where sheeting had peeled away. We recommend treatment with PTFE+BC to {{reduce the likelihood of}} <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> nesting on bridge surfaces, but this should be supplemented with weekly site visits to check treatment integrity and to remove any partial nests on untreated surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Buggy Creek (BCR) {{virus is}} an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is {{naturally}} transmitted to its vertebrate host the <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) by an invertebrate vector, namely the cimicid swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius).

The percentage of <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> nests containing bugs infected with BCR virus increased significantly with colony size at a site in the current year and at the site in the previous year.

40|$|The general {{biology of}} the South African <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallow</b> Hirundo spilodera was studied over a two year {{period in the}} central Orange Free State. This species is highly colonial, nesting mostly on {{man-made}} structures such as concrete road bridges. Adult birds were usually faithful to their breeding colony and very few individuals changed colonies. The <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallow</b> had a surprisingly large vocal repertoire for a swallow and contact calls of the young were individually recognizable. Three species-specific ectoparasites parasitized the <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallow</b> but none {{seemed to have a}} noticeable negative effect on the swallows.

40|$|Colonially nesting <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Passeriformes: Hirundo pyrrhonota) in southwesternNebraska, USA, are {{commonly}} parasitized by hematophagous swallow bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae:Oeciacus vicarius) and fleas (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae: Ceratophyllus celsus). We examined towhat degree these ectoparasites represent {{a cost of}} coloniality for <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows.</b> The number ofswallow bugs per nest increased significantly with <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallow</b> colony size. Body mass of nestlingswallows at 10 d of age declined significantly {{as the number of}} bugs per nestling increased. By fumigatinghalf of the nests in some colonies, killing the bugs, and leaving half of the nests as nonfumigatedcontrols, we showed that swallow bugs lower nestling body mass and nestling survivorship in largeCliff Swallow colonies but not in small ones. Bugs cost nestlings, on average, up to 3. 4 g in body mass,and reduced survivorship by up to 50 %. Parasitism by fleas showed no consistent relationship withcolony size during the nestling period but increased significantly with colony size early in the season,when birds were first arriving in the study area. Fleas did not affect nestling body mass or survivorshipand thus, unlike swallow bugs, are probably not important costs of coloniality to <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows.</b> Fieldobservations and nest fumigation experiments showed that <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows</b> apparently assess whichnests are heavily infested with swallow bugs early each spring and select parasite-free nests, leadingsometimes to alternate-year colony site usage. <b>Cliff</b> <b>Swallows</b> were more likely to construct new nests(rather than reusing old ones) in large colonies than in small colonies, probably in response to heavierinfestations of ectoparasites in the existing nests of large colonies...|$|R
40|$|The <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) {{could play}} an {{important}} role in the transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) because of its breeding ecology, reservoir competence status, and potentially high natural exposure rates. <b>Cliff</b> <b>swallows</b> nest within colonies and their nests are occupied year-round by swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius), hematophagus ectoparasites that feed primarily on <b>cliff</b> <b>swallows.</b> These parasites are likely exposed to WNV while feeding on infectious blood of nesting <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> adults and nestlings and thus, if competent vectors, could contribute to seasonal elevations in WNV transmission. In addition, swallow bugs remain within nests year-round and therefore could provide a potential overwintering mechanism for WNV if persistently infected. To test the hypotheses that swallow bugs are competent vectors and become persistently infected with WNV, we experimentally inoculated <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> nestlings, allowed swallow bugs to feed on these birds during the acute phase of infection, and then exposed naive <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> nestlings to the same swallow bugs. In addition, a subset of swallow bugs that fed on infectious swallow nestlings was maintained through a simulated overwintering period. Although swallow bugs ingested infectious blood (up to 106. 8 plaque-forming units of WNV/mL serum) and subsequently blood-fed on naive swallows, no WNV transmission was detected, and all bugs tested WNV negative after the simulated overwintering period.

Here we examine the adaptive, humoral immune responses of a resistant, native bird and a susceptible, invasive bird to an arbovirus (Buggy Creek virus; Togaviridae: Alphavirus) and its ectoparasitic arthropod vector (the swallow bug; Oeciacus vicarius). Swallow bugs parasitize the native, colonially nesting <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and the introduced house sparrow (Passer domesticus) that occupies nests in <b>cliff</b> <b>swallow</b> colonies.
