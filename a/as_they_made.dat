5|$|Back in Egypt, {{and after}} {{a short period of}} rest, Kippenberger set about {{rebuilding}} the battalion, which had lost over half its original complement. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers continued to arrive for several weeks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way across the Mediterranean in small sailboats. By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E
5|$|The altered {{bill was}} passed as an Act of Parliament in 1834. It was this act which founded the City of London School, which {{initially}} had around 400pupils. The act gave the Corporation of London {{a duty to}} maintain a school on the Honey Lane Market site and so gave control over {{almost every aspect of}} the school's running to the Corporation. A committee was also set up to manage the school, with Hale as chairman. Although the committee's powers were initially limited, they gained more control over time <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> important decisions for the school.|$|E

5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way back to the dressing room.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E
5|$|In {{a three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 15 August, the England XI defeated Gloucestershire at The Oval by 6 wickets after Grace {{had won the}} toss for his county and decided to bat. They scored 118 (Grace 25) and England replied with 163 (Grace 3–67). Rain prevented play {{for most of the}} Friday and Gloucestershire in their second innings had reached 27–1 {{at the end of the}} day. On the Saturday, England bowled them out for 118 (Grace 29) with Tom Emmett taking 8–51 (12–93 in the match). Grace took 3–39 in England's second innings <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> 7–44 to win by six wickets. Midwinter suffered a hand injury in the field when he attempted to stop a powerful drive played by George Ulyett; he was unable to play again in 1878.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February, Wyoming steamed out of New York to {{join the}} annual fleet {{maneuvers}} off Cuba, before returning to New York on 14 April. On 12 May, she left port to help guide a group of Navy Curtiss NC flying boats <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, Wyoming entered dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific. Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch guns. After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated Pacific Fleet. On 19 July, Wyoming {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached San Diego, California on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July, {{during a}} Malta supply convoy (Operation Substance), Forester rescued {{survivors}} from her sister , {{which had been}} attacked by Italian torpedo-bombers, and then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes. A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy (Operation Style). Over the next several months, Forester participated in Operation Halberd, another Malta convoy and escorted Ark Royal and Furious <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> several trips to fly off aircraft for Malta (Operations Status, Status II and Callboy). Upon her return to the UK on 26 October, the destroyer was briefly assigned to the 11th Escort Group before rejoining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in November. She then began a lengthy refit and work up that lasted until April 1942.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E

5|$|The 20th Battalion was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{having lost}} over half its original complement of personnel during the Greece and Crete campaigns. After {{a short period}} of rest, Kippenberger set about bringing the battalion back up to strength. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers, separated from the battalion for various reasons during the previous two months while in Greece and Crete, continued to arrive for several weeks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way across the Mediterranean by various means, including small sailboats. By mid-June, the battalion was at full strength and several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{entered the}} village by 16:30. Lieutenant Colonel Borislav Đukić, {{in command of}} the Tactical Group-1 tasked with capture of Kijevo and the {{commanding}} officer of the JNA 221st Motorised Infantry Brigade, reported that the village was secured by 22:30. The Croatian police fled Kijevo in three groups via Mount Kozjak towards Drniš. The remaining Croatian population left after the artillery had destroyed much of their settlements. The retreating groups were pursued by the Yugoslav Air Force jets <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way across the Kozjak. Radio Television Belgrade reporter Vesna Jugović recorded these events. Krajina units commanded by Martić acted in concert with JNA to take command of the area.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the advance}} party of the Alsos Mission moved to Normandy in August 1944, where it joined T-Force, a similar {{formation}} to S-Force, at Rambouillet, where it was preparing for the liberation of Paris. An Alsos Mission team including Pash and Calvert reached Joliot-Curie's house in the Paris suburbs on 24 August to find {{that he was not}} there, but at his laboratory at the Collège de France. The next day they reached the Porte d'Orléans where they encountered troops of the French 2e Division Blindée, who were engaged in liberating the city, and came under small arms fire from the German defenders.

5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a strengthening ridge to the south, Linfa began tracking eastward. Despite its proximity to land, the tropical storm's slow forward motion allowed for additional strengthening, {{and according to the}} JMA, Linfa reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90km/h (50mph) at 0000UTC on May27, just within the threshold of severe tropical storm status. Concurrently the cyclone made landfall near Dagupan, Luzon. Upon landfall, Linfa began to weaken as it crossed Luzon before emerging into the Pacific as a minimal tropical storm late that day. However, as a result of land interaction the initial surface circulation center of Linfa greatly weakened and was overtaken by a newly formed low-level circulation center on May28, resulting in the storm's position to shift well northeastward. This was the primary basis on which the JTWC downgraded Linfa to tropical depression status early on May28, though the JMA continued to analyze the system as a weak tropical storm. Afterwards, as the cyclone began to track northeastward, the new circulation center became more organized, resulting in the JTWC reclassifying Linfa as a tropical storm at 0600UTC the following day. Gradual strengthening followed, and at 1800UTC that day Linfa reached peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg) south of Okinawa. Subsequently the system began to take a more northward course and undergo extratropical transition, which was completed at 0000UTC on May30. Though by this time most tropical cyclone monitoring agencies ceased the monitoring of these extratropical remnants by this time, the JMA continued to track them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> landfall near Uwajima, Ehime at 0800UTC the following day. Linfa's remnants then paralleled the western coast of Japan before dissipating on June4 well into the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E
5|$|They {{held their}} first London gigs {{in support of}} the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Huw Williams. After warm up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London {{performance}} took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for NME. When George arrived for the interview, Matthews asked if he'd be interested in becoming the band's manager. He politely declined, saying that he didn't have the experience. On the 19 and 20 February 1994, the band's follow-up EP, Hooked was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at the Falcon the Splash Club in London where several music executives were to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then spent the afternoon drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they'd needed to borrow money from a fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge {{on the way back to}} Cardiff.|$|E
