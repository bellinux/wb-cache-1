3000|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) {{is defined as}} an investment involving a long-term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other {{than that of the}} foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or <b>affiliated</b> <b>enterprise</b> or foreign affiliate) [6]. According to the World Trade Organization [7], FDI occurs when an investor based in one country (the home country) acquires an asset in another country (the host country) with the intent to manage that asset [8]. The management dimension is what distinguishes FDI from portfolio investment in foreign stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. In most instances, both the investor and the asset it manages abroad are business firms. In such cases, the investor is typically referred to as the “parent firm” and the asset as the “affiliate” or “subsidiary.” FDI is the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 % or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments [6]. Studies have shown the special role of FDI in developing economies such as resolving employment issues [9], addressing the lack of investment capital [10], economic restructuring [10], providing modern technology, or transferring management experiences to local businesses. FDI is a type of long-term investment of individuals or companies in one country to another country by establishing the subsidiary companies or new businesses. Those individuals and companies will take the control of these enterprises. According to Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam, 1996, FDI is “The foreign investors bring into Vietnam the capital or any assets to carry out investment activities in accordance with the law of Vietnam.” [...]...|$|E
