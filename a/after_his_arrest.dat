5|$|<b>After</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest</b> Biko {{was held}} in custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest,</b> Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room.

In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E
5|$|Buscetta {{claimed that}} Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{organized}} De Mauro’s kidnap, because his {{investigations into the}} death of Mattei {{came very close to}} the Mafia, and Bontade’s own role in the affair. Another pentito, Francesco Di Carlo, declared in 2001 that De Mauro was killed because he had learned that one of his former fascist friends, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, was planning a coup d'état (the so-called Golpe Borghese) with like-minded army officers determined to stop what they considered as Italy's drift to the left. Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest</b> in October 2010, said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Mostow, an {{immigrant}} from Uzbekistan {{with a history}} of involuntary commitment, is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest.</b> Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill. The agents meet with Patterson who has spent three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E

The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not.

He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest</b> and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E

Mercedes (Jaime Winstone), who they previously met at the black site prison, kills Lazaro, saving them.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, he saw {{action against}} Jewish guerrillas during the Palestine Emergency. While in Palestine, {{he participated in}} {{operations}} to arrest Jewish militants. During Operation Agatha, which saw most of the Jewish political leadership in Palestine detained, Mitchell's mission was to arrest Moshe Shertok (a future Prime Minister of Israel). Initially, his unit raided the wrong house. However, they were later able to find and arrest him. In July 1946, he witnessed the King David Hotel bombing: he and his company commander were within 300 feet of the building when the bombing occurred. While on a personal reconnaissance mission, he was shot and wounded {{by one of his}} own Bren gunners, who mistook him for a guerrilla. After recovering from his injuries, he was transferred from his regiment to become aide-de-camp to General Gordon MacMillan, the commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. He spent a total of three years in Palestine. While there, he made friends among both the Arabs and Jews, including Moshe Dayan, a future Israeli general who would become one of Mitchell's heroes, as well as Moshe Shertok, who developed a cordial relationship with Mitchell <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest</b> and corresponded with him for years afterward, when he became a senior Israeli government official.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrest</b> that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E
