40|$|This article {{considers}} voluntary {{provision of}} public {{goods in the}} presence of <b>administrative</b> <b>costs.</b> Government collects taxes and provides grants to a char-ity.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{efficiency}} of road tax in the tax system of the Czech Republic, focusing on the <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> of taxation on the timeline 2005 to 2009. It contains a theoretical definition of tax efficiency, and describes the types of costs connected with taxes. From this perspective it focuses on quantifying the direct <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> of road tax. Direct measurement of <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> is done by using the method called the method of recounted worker which classifies employees of local tax authorities in separate groups and assigns each group a specific number of employees for each reference road tax using the conversion factors. Then it defines the total expenditure of local tax authorities using the coefficients for a particular monitored tax and it provides <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> {{as a percentage of}} road tax receipts. It can be said from obtained results that direct <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> of road taxes are higher, especially if the Ministry of Finance (2004) states that the average direct <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> of the tax system in the Czech Republic reach about 2 [*]%.
