25|$|Phytoestrogens mainly {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} {{substituted}} natural phenolic compounds: the coumestans, prenylflavonoids and isoflavones <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in soy and red clover. Lignans have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids. Mycoestrogens have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of Fusarium, especially common on cereal grains, but also occurring elsewhere, e.g. on various forages. Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens, these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic.|$|E

25|$|Expressionism and Symbolism are broad rubrics {{encompassing}} {{several important}} and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated {{much of the}} avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern, and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. Fauvism, Die Brücke, and Der Blaue Reiter <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as Marc Chagall, whose painting I and the Village, (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines {{the relationship between the}} artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Chaim Soutine, James Ensor, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz, Georges Rouault, Amedeo Modigliani and some of the Americans abroad like Marsden Hartley, and Stuart Davis, were considered influential expressionist painters. Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as an intense Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.|$|E
25|$|Lone Islands: The Lone Islands are {{the most}} populous and busiest of the islands in the Eastern Ocean. There <b>are</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them: Doorn, Avra, and Felimath. Felimath is a quiet, rural island of pastures, mostly used for grazing sheep. Avra {{is the home of}} Bernstead, Duke Bern's estate (as well as others). It is a {{slightly}} more mountainous island, famous for its vast vineyards. Doorn is the largest island and also the most important, for its main town of Narrowhaven. Narrowhaven is the largest island nexus of trade in the whole of the Ocean. Merchants and goods pass through its harbor and its streets from all the mainland kingdoms and all the islands. There is a unique intersection there between Narnians, Calormenes, and Islanders. The Lone Islands were restored to Narnian rule by King Caspian X himself on his voyage {{to the end of the}} world. (They had been attached to Narnia already at the time of the White Witch, and then High King Peter ruled them under the title Emperor of the Lone Islands.) (PC). Prior to being reclaimed by Caspian, they were overseen by Gumpas, and were a great center of the slave trade. Following Caspian X's visit, the Lone Islands were ruled for him by Duke Bern.|$|E
