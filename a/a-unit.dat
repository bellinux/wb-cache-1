5000|$|The RF-16 quickly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a reliable and rugged locomotive with tough [...] "lugging power." [...] Many of the units saw service hauling coal drags, where these characteristics were put to best use. A handful of RF-16s were repowered with ALCO prime movers over the years, with mixed results. The Baltimore and Ohio retired its Sharknoses as a class in 1962. In 1966, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the largest single owner of RF-16s, ceased use of the distinctive locomotives. In 1967, the Monongahela Railway purchased seven <b>A-units</b> and two cabless B-units, the last remaining units from the New York Central Sharknose fleet. By 1971, all but two of the units, 1205 and 1216, had been sold for scrap. The final pair were to be scrapped in 1974, but were saved when the Delaware and Hudson Railroad purchased both units from the scrap dealer in exchange for an equal value of scrap steel. They were used in freight service and in passenger excursion service on the D&H until late 1978, when they were purchased by Illinois-based Castolite Corporation. The pair was leased for use on the Michigan Northern Railway in 1979. Both units suffered mechanical damage and have reportedly been stored since 1981 on the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad, inside a warehouse that is inaccessible to the public. The units have been photographed outside of the building as late as 2012, with roofs and prime movers removed.|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks at}} factors {{relating}} to the noncompletion of units of study by students in a secondary college. It is aimed at providing information for decision-makers at Erindale College specifically {{in the area of}} course counselling. Administrators and counsellors at other colleges should also find the information of value. The study compared a sample of students who completed all their chosen units of study in one semester with all students who did not complete all of their chosen units in that semester. The latter group consisted of those who withdrew from one or more units during the semester, those who left the college and those who were deemed "unassessable" as a result of poor attendance or nonsubmission of assessment items. All 362 students in the college were asked to complete a Baseline Questionnaire during Week 3 of Semester 1, 1985. This sought background information about reasons for enrolling at college, influences on their choice of units, future intentions, preferred ways of learning and other details. Students who withdrew from, or changed units during the semester were asked to complete a Change of Unit Survey and any leavers were asked to complete a Leaver's Survey. In Week 16 (May, 1985) all students still enrolled were asked to complete an End of Semester Questionnaire designed to enable comparisons of attitudes between those who completed all units and those who did not. The study looks at a number of characteristics of students and their attitudes to various aspects of learning, college life and choice of units of study. It attempts to look at factors that might affect the student's decision to complete or not complete a chosen unit of study. The factors considered were largely based upon studies of early school leavers. FINDINGS. 1. Students who do not complete units tend to have {{one or more of the}} following characteristics (significant at the 0. 05 level) : (a) do not enrol to gain tertiary entrance qualifications (b) enrol to improve their chances of getting a job (c) are not definitely seeking a tertiary entrance score (d) have no definite intention of completing Year 12 (e) have no firm intention of studying subjects in order to complete major or minor courses in them (f) are less likely to have a part-time job (g) by the end of the semester, are not happy with their marks in most units (h) finish the semester studying less than 3 T-units (i) continue into Semester 2 with 3 or more <b>A-units</b> and less than 3 T-units (j) do not consider their parents' wishes an important influence on the choice of units for Semester 2. In addition to these, one other finding of interest, with a significance of 0. 055 (approx.), showed that noncompleters tend to come from a socio-economic background of parents who are either managers/employers/self-employed or manual-skilled workers (i. e. not professional or nonmanual/clerical). 2. No significant differences at the 0. 05 level were found between males and females nor between Year 11 and Year 12 students in their tendency to complete units. 3. Students who change or withdraw from units give the following reasons (in rank order of frequency) : - they are getting poor marks - they are unable to understand the work - they find the class activities uninteresting - they state that the content is not very relevant to their needs - the unit is not suited to their career plans. IMPLICATIONS. The implications for administrators at Erindale College are: 1. Students should be encouraged to formulate specific goals and develop a commitment to their education. 2. Students who are "at risk" need to be identified early and given tutorial assistance in units where they are having difficulty with understanding. 3. The curriculum must be kept under review in order to provide for the needs of all students...|$|R

They were built for the Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger train, which travelled as a unified train from Chicago, Illinois, to Limon, Colorado, but then divided; with one section going to Colorado Springs, Colorado, {{and the other to}} Denver, Colorado. The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route, but could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs. A regular, cab-equipped <b>A-unit</b> could have been purchased, but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train, so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an E-series E6B (B unit) but with an operating cab, headlight, pilot, and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive.|$|E

40|$|Cholera toxin, one of {{the toxins}} that may be {{generated}} by various strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, {{can be considered as}} a substance possibly used in biological warfare. The possibilities of characterising the toxin by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ES-MS) were investigated. The toxin can be detected by flow-injection (FIA) ES-MS of a dialysed solution and observation of the charge envelope signals of its <b>A-unit</b> and B-chain protein; sufficient information for identification by the molecular mass of either protein could be obtained for quantities in the order of 10 fmol. Confirmatory analysis was carried out by 2 -mercaptoethanol reduction and FIA-ES-MS detection of the product proteins or by tryptic digest LC-ES-MS with ion chromatogram detection of most of the tryptic fragments of the <b>A-unit</b> and B-chain from the singly, doubly or triply charged ion signals. The confirmatory tryptic digest LC-ES-MS analysis could be achieved with quantities as low as 1 pmol. Possible biovariations in the toxin can mostly be determined by sequencing, where the amino acid composition of tryptic fragments of the A 1 -chain, T 5 and T 15, and of the B-chain, T 1, T 4 and T 5, cover all known biovariations. Partial sequencing of cholera toxin, originating from a classical strain, O 1 / 569 B, was achieved by LC-ES-MS/MS of most tryptic fragments larger than three amino acid residues.

Estimation of this output frontier provides key information on the relative importance of inputs in the harvest of tiger prawns, output elasticities, returns to scale and the economic performance of each fishing vessel, year to year.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{production}} technology and relative efficiency of vessels harvesting banana and tiger prawns in the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), one of Australia’s largest and most lucrative fishing areas. It is based on an unbalanaced panel data set of 226 observations among thirty-seven vessels for the years 1990 - 1996 and employs a technique which specifies a stochastic frontier production function in order to decompose the variation among vessels in the harvest of prawns due to unbounded random effects beyond firm control from those that result in differences in technical inefficiency among fishing vessels in the industry. In other words, variations in maximum expected output can occure either as a result of stochastic effects (e. g., good and bad weather states), or from the fact that vessels in the industry may be operating at various levels of inefficiency due to mismanagement, poor incentive structures, less than perfectly competitive behaviour or inappropriate input levels or combinations. Estimation of this output frontier also provides key information on the relative importance of inputs in the production of banana and tiger prawns, output elasticities, returns to scale, possible variations in stock size and the economic performance of each fishing vessel, year to year. Likelihood ratio tests confirm that both stochastic effects and the extent of technical inefficiency matter, thus making traditional OLS estimates inappropriate. The level of technical inefficiency is shown to depend positively on gear headrope length and negatively on either the number of A-units or fuel expenditures. The point is especially relevant since <b>A-unit</b> restrictions over vessel size and engine power in the fishery during this period appear to have resulted in a substitution toward less efficient but unregulated inputs, such as gear headrope length. In this regard, the recent introduction of gear headrope length restrictions may be justified on two counts, both as a device to limit effor or tach and protect prawn stocks and as a way, given the final estimates in this paper, of improving economic performance by increasing the technical efficiency of vessels remaining in the industry. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that restrictions on an existing inefficient input may result in far smaller reductions in effort than projected, since the technical efficiency of vessels in the fishery will rise. With an increase in technical efficiency, gear-restricted fishing firms will harvest at points closer to their output frontiers. Moreover, with the removal of <b>A-unit</b> restrictions, ‘effort creep’ in the form of larger vessels and more powerful engines may more than compensate for any decrease in effort due to gear reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|Relato de caso de miastenia grave induzida por D-penicilamina. São descutidos os possíveis mecanismos etiopatogênicos envolvidos no desencadeamento da doença e é salientada a presença de anticorpo anti-receptor de acetilcolina e hiperplasia tímica na DPA-MG. The {{development}} of autoimmune diseases {{in some patients}} treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) suggests that the reported occurrence of a conduction disorder at the neuromuscular junction and the {{development of}} a reversible myasthenia gravis in rheumatoid disease, progressive systemic sclerosis or Wilson's disease after the use of DPA are part of a general predisposition for autoimmune disease related to DPA therapy. The case reported is an example. The DPA- induced myasthenia gravis (MO) is similar to the spontaneous MG clinically and electrophysiologically, though ocular signs prevail in the former. Antibodies to acetylcholine receptor have been demonstrated and thymic hyperplasia also has been formed. Regarding the onset of myasthenic manifestations the duration of the treatment with DPA varies from 6 to 10 months. The action of DPA on the neuromuscular junction is different from that occurring in spontaneous MG. The pathogenesis of the DPA induced MG is still obscure. The chemical properties of DPA permit it to react with many proteins and some alteration of proteins may appear, with structural changes in the composition and antigenicity of the collagen fibers. In vitro DPA causes disorder of acetylcholine receptor bridges to a,b,g sub-units with reduction of the S-S bridges in the g-subunit. This decreases the linkage of high affinity and abolishes its positive cooperative system, reducing the S-S connection in the <b>a-unit</b> near the acetylcholine linkage. The interation between DPA and receptor may induce antigenic alteration in this latter, starting the autoimmune phenomena. The other possibility is the stimulation of prostaglandin E-l synthesis by DPA may fill the allosteric place of ACh receptor, interfering on the neuromuscular junction...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this study the {{influence}} of mechanical stimuli was examined in addition to the "general" rehabilitativen measures by means of oscillatory interventions by the Galileo in 2000 on the femoral musculature after reconstruction of the vorde-ren cruciate ligament of the knee joint. Moreover a Galileogruppe with oscillatory stimulation of a control group was compared with-put without in addition stimulation to the ambulant rehabilitation program. All patients had received an arthroskopisch carried out front cruciate ligament plastic with Semitentinosus-trans-planning which was carried out by two surgeons who assisted themselves mutually in the single operations and have used the same technology. The examined group enclosed a total of 51 patients from whom 36 positioned themselves to the re-examination. The Galileo in 2000 device works as a seesaw with an amplitude of 0 - 5 mms (media after distal) with changeable frequency. To the increase of the muscle achievement a frequency of 25 - 27 hertz which correspond to an average cycle duration of approx. 38. 5 milliseconds has proved itself. This is the time which is required to generate a natural stretch reflex of the agonists and antagonist in a closed chain with On and Abbewegungen in each case. It were carried out praeoperativ as well as 12 weeks post surgically sonographische and isokinetische measurements. In addition it was carried out prae and post surgical score comparison by means of Tenger and Lysholmscore. With the Cybexmessung appeared with the averages of the torque maxima of the corner speeds of 90 ° / see and 120 ° / see post surgically a similar hold in both groups. Significant differences can be recognised with 150 ° / see. While in the Galileogruppe the trend towards the continuous decrease of the maxima will maintain, the trend course falls in the control group clearly from. z In addition, were carried out sonografisch muscle cross sections with 10 cm and 20 cm proximal of the palpateable knee joint gap {{in the area of the}} media, ventralen and latera-len Kompartiments. In comparison to praeoperativ achieved Wer-ten the musculature thickness of the affected extremity decreases post surgically in almost all areas about other 10 % in comparison to the not affected extremity. The weakly significant reduction of the musculature thickness in the controlling group in the media measuring point 10 cm proximal of the knee joint gap in comparison to healthy side is remarkable. The distribution of the sporty activity with the help of the Tenger score in favour of the Galileogruppe shows presurgically as well as post surgically a weakly positive Signi-fikanz in the subjective judgement of the post surgical result by means of Lysholm score the patients are "more contented" in the control group than in the Galileogruppe, even if computationally no significance exists. In the operated knee joint regularisation mechanisms seem to be shifted by changes of the pre-settings specific for muscle and/or neuro-physiological by the Galileoanwendung in a more sensitive direction. In the control group the muscle diameter decreases in the media area in 10 cm proximal of the knee joint as well as the torque maximum significantly. The strength development is influenced like in our experiment said, among the rest, also by reflex mechanisms here by means of mechanically oscillatory Stimulie. It comes in spite of early-functional ill-gymnastic treatment to an Abschwä-chung of the torques of the femoral trail musculature and with it to <b>a-unit</b> deformation of the Strecker/Beuger relation to to the Beugern which are to be understood as agonists of the VKB and also the patella tendons beginning. This change of the muskulären balance should prevent much too big ventralen feed of the tibia and prevent the graft. On this occasion, mechanical Stimulie can perform her contribution to the muscle construction by means of oscillation like with Galileo in 2000. Conclusion: Protective mechanisms are influenced by support of the reflex mechanisms by mechanical stimuli by means of an oscillatory intervention within {{the scope of}} the early-functional activation of the propiozeptiven system on the femoral musculature after reconstruction of the front cruciate ligament of the knee joint...|$|E
40|$|Chitin is {{a linear}} {{biopolymer}} composed of 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucopyranose (N -acetylglucosamine or GlcNAc, <b>A-unit)</b> linked by ß – (1 - 4) glycosidic linkages. Chitin occurs as a structural polysaccharide in animals with an outer skeleton (Arthropoda), {{and in the}} cell wall of certain fungi. In the cuticle of crustaceans and insects, chitin exists in close association with proteins, minerals and pigments. In Vietnam, a country endowed with favorable conditions for aquaculture, the annual shrimp production from aquaculture is approximately 450 000 metric tons (2010), and one third of this is byproducts, including head and shell. The two major species are white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). These shrimp by-products are a large resource not only for chitin but also for other valuable components as proteins and pigments. The chemical composition of heads and shells of the black tiger and the white shrimp was analysed. The amounts of the three main components, i. e. proteins, chitin, and minerals, {{were found to be}} similar in the by-products from the two shrimp species. The protein contents of the heads were 44. 39 ± 0. 50 % and 48. 56 ± 1. 33 % of the dry weight in the white shrimp and black tiger shrimp, respectively, which were about 50 % higher than in the shells. In the shells, the chitin content were 27. 37 ± 1. 82 % and 29. 29 ± 1. 78 % of the dry weight in the white shrimp and black tiger shrimp, respectively, which were more than 2. 5 times higher than in the heads. These large differences in the chemical composition of the heads and the shells had consequences for the optimal extraction conditions in order to isolate a pure and high molecular weight chitin from isolated heads and shells. The amino acid composition of the proteins were similar for the two species, both for heads and shells, and with a profile that was suitable as a source for fish feed. Chitin is insoluble in aqueous solvents, which limits its applications. However, by partly removing chitin’s acetyl groups and thereby introducing amino groups that can be protonated and positively charged (D -units), the water-soluble polysaccharide chitosan can be prepared. This is performed by chemical de-N-acetylation of chitin at highly alkaline conditions and high temperature. The de-N-acetylation reaction was studied in detail with the chitin disaccharide (GlcNAc-GlcNAc or AA) as a model substrate. The resonances in 1 H NMR spectrum of the chitin disaccharide in 2. 77 M NaOD were assigned. The ß-anomeric protons of the four different disaccharides, i. e. AA, DD, AD, and DA, are well separated and can be monitored during the de- N -acetylation. Thus, the rate of de-N-acetylation of the reducing end was found to be twice the rate of the nonreducing ends. The total rate of de- N -acetylation of chitin disaccharide was for the first time determined to be second order with respect to sodium hydroxide concentration. This contributes to explain the differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous de- N -acetylation reaction. The activation energy for the reaction was determined to 114. 4 and 98. 6 kJ/mol in 2. 77 M and 5. 5 M NaOD, respectively. Hydrogels of biopolymers have attracted much attention for their applications in e. g. tissue engineering, immobilization of cells and controlled drug release. A new gelling system of chitosan – alginate, or their corresponding oligomers, is described. The gelling system was studied by combining either poly-mannuronate and chitosan oligomers, or polymeric chitosan and mannuronate oligomers. The two components were mixed at a pH well above the pKa-values of the amino-groups, where the chitosan/chitosan oligomers are almost uncharged, allowing mixing with the negatively charged poly-mannuronate/mannuronate oligomers without the precipitation that would otherwise occur upon mixing a polyanion with a polycation. Then the pH was lowered by adding D-glucono-δ-lactone (GDL), a proton donating substance with the ability to release protons in a controlled way, so that the amino groups of chitosan/chitosan oligomers were protonated and thereby positively charged, resulting in the formation of a hydrogel. The neutral-solubility of the polymeric chitosan is achieved by selecting a polymeric chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 40 %, while the neutral-solubility of the (fully de-N-acetylated) chitosan oligomers is obtained by selecting oligomers with a chain length below 10. The kinetics of gelation was fast in both gelling systems, with a sol-gel transition within the time for the first measurements. Initial rates of gelation and gel strengths (measured as storage modulus, G’) increased with increasing concentration of oligomers. The gel strength (G’) of both gelling systems increased with increasing GDL concentration (and thereby the final pH of the gel) from neutral pH down to pH 4, and decreased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that ionic hydrogels are formed. The importance of the nearly perfect match in distance between the negative charges {{on the same side of}} poly-mannuronate/mannuronate oligomers and the positive charges on the same side of chitosan/chitosan oligomers is crucial for these gelling systems, as demonstrated by the very different gel strengths of two alginates with extreme composition, i. e. a poly-mannuronate and a poly-guluronate, where poly-mannuronate formed relatively strong gels with chitosan oligomers while poly-guluronate formed gels of very limited mechanical strength.
