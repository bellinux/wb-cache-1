The approach uses neural networks as a statistical or machine learning technique for an accurate and fast emulation or statistical approximation of model physics parameterizations. It is applied to development of an accurate and fast approximation of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> parameterization for the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model, {{which is the most}} time consuming component of model physics. The developed neural network emulation is two orders of magnitude, 50 - 80 times, faster than the original parameterization. A comparison of the parallel 1 O-yr climate simulations performed with the original parameterization and its neural network emulations confirmed that these simulations produce almost identical results. The obtained results show the conceptual and practical possibility of an efficient synergetic combination of deterministic and statistical learning components within an atmospheric climate or forecast model.

The vertical profile of the atmospheric net radiation entropy flux follows approximately that of the atmospheric net longwave radiation entropy flux. Sensitivity study further reveals that a ‘darker’ atmosphere with a larger overall atmospheric longwave optical depth exhibits a smaller net radiation entropy flux at all altitudes, suggesting an intrinsic connection between the atmospheric net radiation entropy flux and the overall atmospheric longwave optical depth.

The approach adopted {{is to use}} the mean meridional circulation (MMC) as a proxy for the friction torque, and then to examine the MMC that is driven both by eddy fluxes and zonal mean diabatic heating.

For the austral winter (May through September), the anomalous friction torque in both hemispheres is driven by anomalous zonal mean convection. For the boreal winter (November through March), the anomalous friction torque in the Northern Hemisphere is driven primarily by eddy fluxes, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the anomalous friction torque is also driven by anomalous zonal mean convection. However, the dynamics associated with this convection for the Southern Hemisphere boreal winter may be rather subtle, as the results suggest that this convection may in turn be driven by eddies within the Northern Hemisphere. 1...|$|R

An AGCM simulation of the potential impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming on climate, em-ploying a version of NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM 1 -Oz), is presented. The joint impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming are assessed by an experiment in which removal of tropical rainforests is imposed into a greenhouse-warmed climate. Results show that the joint climate changes over tropical rainforest regions comprise large reductions in surface evapotranspiration (by about – 180 mm yr− 1) and precipitation (by about – 312 mm yr− 1) over the Amazon Basin, along with an increase of surface temperature by + 3. 0 K. Over Southeast Asia, similar but weaker changes are found in this study. Precipitation is decreased by – 172 mm yr− 1, together with the surface warming of 2. 1 K. Over tropical Africa, changes in regional climate is much weaker and with some different features, such as the increase of precipitation by 25 mm yr− 1. Energy budget analyses demonstrates that the large increase of surface temperature in the joint experiment is not solely produced by the increase of CO 2 concentration, but is a joint effect of the reduction of surface evaporation (due to deforestation) and the increase of downward <b>atmospheric</b> <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> (due to the doublin...|$|E

This study evaluates incoming longwave radiation measured at two nearby glacier stations in the high Andes of the Norte Chico region of Chile. These data are the first published records of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> measurements in this region. Nine previously published optimised parameterisations for clear sky emissivity all pro-duced results with a {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) ~ 20 W m− 2 and bias within ± 5 W m− 2, which is inline with findings from other regions. Six optimised parameterisations for incoming longwave in all sky conditions were trialled for application to this site, five of which performed comparably well with RMSE on daytime data < 18 Wm− 2 and bias within ± 6 Wm− 2 when applied to the optimisation site and RMSE < 20 Wm− 2 and bias within ± 10 W m− 2 when applied to the validation site. The parameterisation proposed by Mölg et al. (J Glaciol 55 : 292 - 302, 2009) was selected for use in this region. Incorporating the proposed elevation modification into the equation reduced the bias in the mod-elled incoming longwave radiation for the validation site. It was found that applying the parameterisation optimised in the original work at Kilimanjaro produced good results at both the primary and validation site in this study, suggesting that this formulation may be robust for different high moun-tain regions. ...|$|E

The continuous monitoring is important to maintain {{the safety of the}} visitors and park service personnel, plan and relocate infrastructure, and study potential impact from nearby geothermal development including oil and gas industry. This dissertation is part of a study initiated in the early 2000 s to monitor the thermal activity of dynamic areas within the Park, using airborne remote sensing imagery. This study was focused in Norris Geyser Basin, the hottest geyser basin in the park, located near the northwestern rim of the Yellowstone’s caldera. The study is considered the first long-term comprehensive airborne remote sensing study in the basin which took place between August 2008 and October 2013. In this study, at least one 1 -meter resolution thermal infrared image and three-band images (multispectral) were acquired and used to estimate year-to-year changes in radiant temperature, radiant flux, and radiant power from the thermal source in Norris. Presence of residual radiant flux in the ground from absorbed solar radiation and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> was the main challenge to compere year-to-year changes in the thermal activity. This residual flux is included in the total radiant flux calculated through the remote sensing images which gives false estimates of the flux generated from the underling thermal source. Two methods were suggested in Chapters 2 and 4 of this dissertation to estimate the residual radiant flux. A method was developed in Chapter 2 to estimate the residual radiant flux in a bare ground area covered with hydrothermal siliceous sinter deposit. The method compared ground-based measurements with high spatial resolution airborne remote sensing measurements to estimate the residual radiant flux. In Chapter 4, a method was developed to estimate the residual radiant flux in the six surface classes in Norris, including bare ground, bare ground with siliceous sinter deposit, lakes and pools, river, forest, and grass. The assumptions and implications of each method were discussed to suggest a reliable method to estimate the geothermal radiant flux after subtracting the absorbed residual radiant flux. Chapter 3 provides an analysis of the four components of heat flux in the ground surface, including conduction of sensible heat, convection of sensible heat by liquid water and water vapor, and convection of latent heat by water vapor. The main purpose from the analysis was to assess the hypothesis that the convection and latent heat flux are negligible which therefore supported the results obtained from the analysis in Chapters 2 and 4...|$|E

Excessive rainfall during January 2004 had significant socio-economic impacts on Northeast Brazil. Flooding contributed to loss of life and infrastructure, while {{on the other hand}} the very heavy rains served to fill depleted reservoirs throughout the region. Since all of the seasonal forecasts derived from climate models indicated dryness in the Northeast, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanisms for the excessive rainfall and, if possible, determine the existence of any precursor signals.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vegetation}} on temperature is an emerging {{topic in the}} climate science community. Existing studies have mostly {{examined the effects of}} vegetation on daytime temperature (Tmax), whereas this study investigates the effects on nighttime temperature (Tmin). Ground measurements from 53 sites across northeastern China (NEC) from 1982 to 2006 show that early summer (June) Tmax and Tmin increased at mean rates of approximately 0. 61 °C/ 10 year and 0. 67 °C/ 10 year, respectively. Over the same period, the satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decreased by approximately 0. 10 (accounting for 18 % of the climatological NDVI for 1982 – 1991). It is highlighted that a larger increase in Tmax (Tmin) co-occurred spatially with a larger (smaller) decrease in NDVI. Deriving from such spatial co-occurrences, we found that the spatial variability of changes in Tmax (i. e., ΔTmax) is negatively correlated with the spatial variability of changes in NDVI (i. e., ΔNDVI), while the spatial variability of changes in Tmin (i. e., ΔTmin) is positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 10; p < 0. 05) with that of ΔNDVI. Similarly, we detected significant positive correlations between the spatial variability of ΔNDVI and the change in surface latent heat flux (r 2 = 0. 16; p < 0. 01) and in surface air specific humidity (r 2 = 0. 28; p < 0. 001). These findings on the spatial co-occurrences suggest that the vegetation growth intensifies the atmospheric water vapor through evapotranspiration, which enhances the <b>atmospheric</b> downward <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> and strengthens the greenhouse warming effects at night. Thereby, the positive correlation between ΔNDVI and ΔTmin is better understood. These results indicate that vegetation growth may not only exert effects on daytime temperature but also exert warming effects on nighttime temperature by increasing atmospheric water vapor and thus intensifying the local greenhouse effect.

The algorithms are tested against energy flux measurements available for 24 sites in North America to assess their reliability. These new JGrass-NewAge model components are used (i) to evaluate the performances of simplified models (SMs) of L↓, as presented in literature formulations, and (ii) to determine by automatic calibration the site-specific parameter sets for L↓ in SMs. For locations where calibration is not possible {{because of a lack}} of measured data, we perform a multiple regression using on-site variables, i. e. mean annual air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and altitude. The regressions are verified through a leave-one-out cross validation, which also gathers information about the possible errors of estimation. Most of the SMs, when executed with parameters derived from the multiple regressions, give enhanced performances compared to the corresponding literature formulation. A sensitivity analysis is carried out for each SM to understand how small variations of a given parameter influence SM performance. Regarding the L↓ simulations, the Brunt (1932) and Idso (1981) SMs, in their literature formulations, provide the best performances in many of the sites. The site-specific parameter calibration improves SM performances compared to their literature formulations. Specifically, the root mean square error (RMSE) is almost halved and the Kling–Gupta efficiency is improved at all sites. Also in this case, Brunt (1932) and Idso (1981) SMs provided the best performances.

Above-canopy (35 m) air temperatures were higher than those within (10 m) and below (2 m) canopy throughout four snow seasons (Dec-Apr), demonstrating how the forest canopy can act as a cold sink for air. Lowest model RMSE was using above-canopy air temperature. Further investigation of modeling sub-canopy <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> using above-canopy air temperature showed underestimations, particularly during periods of high insolation. In order to explicitly account for canopy temperatures in modeling <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation,</b> the two-part model was improved by incorporating a measured trunk-view component and trunk temperature. Trunk temperature measurements were up to 25 °C higher than locally measured air temperatures. This three-part model reduced the RMSE by up to 7. 7 Wm- 2 from the two-part air temperature model at all sensor positions across the 2014 snowmelt season, and performed particularly well during periods of high insolation when errors from the two-part model were up to 40 Wm- 2. A parameterization predicting tree trunk temperatures using measured air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation demonstrate a simple method that can be applied to provide input to the three-part model across mid-latitude coniferous forests...|$|R

The effects of water, glass, or Plexiglas filters on radiation were determined. Photosynthetic photon flux (PPF, 400 to 700 nm), spectra (400 to 1000 nm), shortwave radiation (285 - 2800 nm), and total radiation (300 to 100, 000 nm) were measured, and {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR, 400 to 700 nm) and <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> (2800 to 100, 000 nm) were calculated. Measurement of PPF alone was not an adequate characterization of the radiation environment. Total radiant flux varied among lamp types at equal PPF. HID lamps provided a lower percentage of <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> than fluorescent lamps, but, when HID lamps provided PPF levels greater than that possible with fluorescent lamps, the amount of <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> was high. Water was the most effective <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> filter. Glass and Plexiglas similarly filtered longwave more than shortwave radiation, but transmission of nonphotosynthetic shortwave radiation was less with Plexiglas than glass. The filter materials tested would {{not be expected to}} influence photomorphogenesis because radiation in the action spectrum of phytochrome was not altered, but {{this may not be the}} only pigment involved...|$|R
40|$|Reanalyses {{have been}} widely used because they add value to the routine {{observations}} by generating physically/dynamically consistent and spatiotemporally complete atmospheric fields. Existing studies have extensively discussed their temporal suitability in global change study. This study moves forward on their suitability for regional climate change study where land–atmosphere interactions play a more important role. Here, surface air temperature (T a) from 12 current reanalysis products were investigated, focusing on spatial patterns of T a trends, using homogenized T a from 1979 to 2010 at ~  2200 meteorological stations in China. Results show that ~  80  % of the T a mean differences between reanalyses and in-situ observations are attributed to station and model-grid elevation differences, denoting good skill in T a climatology and rebutting the previously reported T a biases. However, the T a trend biases in reanalyses display spatial divergence (standard deviation =  0. 15 – 0. 30  °C/decade at 1 ° ×  1 ° grids). The simulated T a trend biases correlate well with those of precipitation frequency, surface incident solar radiation (R s), and <b>atmospheric</b> downward <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> (L d) among the reanalyses (r  = − 0. 83, 0. 80 and 0. 77, p   T a trend biases (by order of − 0. 07  °C/decade) are caused by the trend biases in R s (by order of 0. 10  °C/decade), L d (by order of − 0. 08  °C/decade) and precipitation frequency (by order of − 0. 06  °C/decade). Over northern China, the T a trend biases (by order of − 0. 12  °C/decade) jointly result from those in L d and precipitation frequency. Therefore, improving simulation of precipitation frequency and R s helps to maximize regional climate signal component. Besides, the T a trend biases show negative spatial correlations (approximately r  = − 0. 26, p  =  0. 00) with inverted trend in NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) implying that incorporating vegetation dynamics can advance regional warming modeling. Inclusion of accurate aerosol information in MERRA- 2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) helps improve regional climate simulation. ERA- 20 CM (a twentieth century atmospheric model ensemble without assimilating observations) presents a comparable pattern of the T a trend biases (standard deviation =  0. 15  °C/decade) to ERA-Interim and JRA- 55 (the Japanese 55 -year Reanalysis) that assimilating some T a observations, which indicates perturbed physical ensemble technique significantly narrows regional warming uncertainties in reanalyses...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study proposes an {{overview}} of the main synoptic, medium-range and intraseasonal modes of convection and precipitation in northern spring (March–June 1979 – 2010) over West and Central Africa, and to understand their atmospheric dynamics. It is based on daily National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration outgoing <b>longwave</b> <b>radiation</b> and Cloud Archive User Service Tb convection data, daily TRMM and Global Precipitation Climatology Project rainfall products and daily ERA-Interim reanalysis atmospheric fields. It is first shown that mesoscale convective systems can be modulated in terms of occurrences number and intensity at such time scales. Based on empirical orthogonal function analyses on the 2 – 90 -day filtered data it is shown that the main mode of convective and rainfall variability is located along the Guinean coast with a moderate to weak extension over Central Africa. Corresponding regressed deseasonalised atmospheric fields highlight an eastward propagation of patterns consistent with convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin wave dynamics. Then a singular spectrum analysis combined with a Hierarchical Ascendant Classification enable to define objectively the main spectral bands of variability within the 2 – 90 -day band, and highlight three main bands, 2 – 8 -, 8 – 22 - and 20 – 90 -day. Within these three bands, space–time spectral decomposition is used to identify the relative impacts of convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin, Rossby and inertia–gravity waves, as well as Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) signal. It confirms that eastward propagating signals (convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin wave and MJO) are highly dominant in these convection and precipitation variability modes over the Guinean coast during northern spring. So, while rain-producing individual systems are moving westward, their activity are highly modulated by sub-regional and regional scales envelops moving to the east. This is a burning issue for operational forecasting centers to be able to monitor and predict such eastward propagating envelops of convective activity...|$|R
