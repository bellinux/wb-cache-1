5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active as it once was, the old filling station <b>and</b> <b>store</b> <b>in</b> downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite's first {{concession}} {{was established}} in 1884 when John Degnan and his wife established a bakery <b>and</b> <b>store.</b> <b>In</b> 1916, the National Park Service granted a 20-year concession to the Desmond Park Service Company. It bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park services. Desmond {{changed its name to}} the Yosemite National Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the name}} Wiggins Point, the place became a {{well-known}} stop for wagon trains heading to Joliet, Illinois along the old Sauk Trail (also called the Sac Trail), {{which was an}} old Indian trail. At one time, 16 trails radiated outward from Wiggins Point. In 1838, Wiggins died. Sometime afterwards, local settlers renamed the place Centerville. Later still, it was renamed Merrillville after the brothers Dudley and William Merrill. Dudley Merrill operated a hotel <b>and</b> <b>store</b> <b>in</b> Centerville, and his son John P. Merrill was a Township Trustee.|$|E
25|$|Sulfur-containing {{gases and}} {{particulates}} can tarnish {{the surface of}} silver. These corrosive agents can come from air pollution, paints, textiles, bacterial by-products, and other chemically treated objects or building materials. When storing silver, museum conservators wrap silver in sulfur-free tissue paper <b>and</b> <b>store</b> <b>in</b> a tight sealed polyethylene bag. Activated charcoal is sometimes used to absorb sulfur by placing it in the bag but not {{in direct contact with}} the object. Likewise, Pacific Silver Cloth has also been used by museums to prevent tarnishing.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 Waitetuna {{residents}} {{agreed to}} build a school, but an 1872 flood washed away the timber for the scheme. A half-time school and a private school ran for a while. Waitetuna School District was gazetted in 1873, but the Education Rate proved insufficient to pay {{the teacher and the}} school closed in 1875. A new school on donated land opened, with a teacher's residence added in 1877 and an adjacent 11 acres added by the Waste Lands Board in 1878. As early as 1882 a petition requested the school be moved away from the damp hollow, but nothing happened until the main road was diverted through the grounds in 1906. On 24 August 1903 Waitetuna School changed its name to Te Uku. In August 1908 the present school was established about 800 metres to the east, with one room on another 2 acres of donated land. Inadvertently, an acre of Church land was taken by the school until sold for a post office <b>and</b> <b>store</b> <b>in</b> 1923. A second classroom was added in 1935, a teacher's house in 1941, a concrete play area in 1948, a football paddock leased from 1951, a prefab added in 1954, a lavatory block in 1957, a school pool in 1961 and the Aramiro School building moved here in 1965. Ohautira Maori School closed in 1969, shortly after the timber mill, and in 1975 another classroom was added.|$|E
