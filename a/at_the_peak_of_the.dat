5|$|Both {{dates of}} the Pilgrim half dollar have {{appreciated}} in price over the years, with the rarer 1921 leading the way, of which only 20,000 are extant. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 1920 sold for $1.75 and the 1921 for $8; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second boom in 1980 the 1920 sold for $275 and the 1921 for $800. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (2015) lists the 1920 at between $85 and $650 and the 1921 at between $170 and $850, each depending on condition. An exceptional specimen of the 1920 sold at auction in 2014 for $7,344.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, William Russell, Alexander Majors, and William Waddell were the three {{founders of the}} Pony Express.

5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US dollars per kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram. Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E

During 1930–31, he participated in the Round Table Conferences in London to discuss India's future and was instrumental in bringing about the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. In 1935, Sastri {{was appointed}} Vice-Chancellor of Annamalai University, in Tamil Nadu, and served from 1935 to 1940. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, he participated in a 15-member Indian delegation which appealed to the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill to provide dominion status to India. He strongly opposed Muslim League demands for the partition of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} {{which had}} plagued Honiara and the islands {{since the late}} 1990s had a devastating impact on the economy {{due to the fact}} that virtually all tourist organisations around the world specifically warned tourists wishing to visit the islands to stay away, especially in 2002 and 2003 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troubles. In 1998, the country earned around $13million from tourism and just $629,000 in 1999, equating to an average spend per visit of only US$254 (about US$35/day). In 1999, tourism in the city and nation accounted for just 4.38% of the total GDP.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are the Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city. Over {{the next four}} centuries, the Ottomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkapı, includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from Baroque inside the Harem, to its Neoclassical style Enderûn Library. The imperial mosques include Fatih Mosque, Bayezid Mosque, Yavuz Selim Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque), and Yeni Mosque, {{all of which were}} built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles. An example of which is the imperial Nuruosmaniye Mosque. Areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace.|$|E

5|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{began in}} the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, the Welsh metal mines {{declined}} and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up to half the workers in the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15–20% by 1850. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work into old age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them {{from the back of}} the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan {{and that he had}} been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included a line in the script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E
5|$|Localized but {{extensive}} {{power outages}} were reported across {{areas that were}} hit by significant amounts of ice. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm over 300,000 customers lost power across the United States. In the Cincinnati area, 122,000 were without power at one point with 52,000 still blacked out as of Wednesday morning. All had been restored by Tuesday morning. About 7,500 customers in Indiana near the Indianapolis region were still without power on February 15, down {{from a peak of}} about 50,000 especially in the Bloomington area. Other states that reported outages included Kentucky (14,000), Maryland (at least 135,000 customers, including 69,000 in Anne Arundel County and 25,000 in Prince George's County, Maryland), New Jersey (36,000), Pennsylvania (10,000 in the Pittsburgh region), Virginia (7,800), and New York (18,000) on Long Island. By 10:00 am Thursday, February 15, about 73,000 homes were without electricity in the Washington DC metropolitan area. Most of those outages were from an ice storm that hit areas from the southern Ohio Valley towards the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
5|$|Moon took {{lessons from}} one of the loudest {{contemporary}} drummers, Screaming Lord Sutch's Carlo Little, at ten shillings per lesson. Moon's early style was influenced by jazz, American surf music and rhythm and blues, exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer Hal Blaine. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). Moon also admired Elvis Presley's original drummer DJ Fontana, the Shadows' original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things' Viv Prince. He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Who's fame.|$|E

5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47, {{with the}} same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. York endured a midseason run of 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of the table by mid September 1947, before a run of two wins from 13 matches saw them drop to 18th place. York finished 1947–48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-war attendance boom. The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures to finish 1948–49 in 14th place.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers first {{appeared}} on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting {{on the front page}} of the first issue. After 22years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of the Rovers, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
