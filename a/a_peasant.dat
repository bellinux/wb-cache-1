5|$|For centuries, in {{accordance}} with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for <b>a</b> <b>peasant</b> or commoner.

During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and samurai in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.|$|E

In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893.

5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a {{semi-autonomous}} king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass <b>a</b> <b>peasant</b> workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants {{away from their}} farms and denied the government {{a significant portion of}} its land tax revenue. To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.|$|E

5|$|Kalinovka was <b>a</b> <b>peasant</b> village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later {{stated that}} she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been. Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school.
