50|$|ARAG {{was renamed}} Research & <b>Assessment</b> <b>Branch</b> in late 2009 and, losing its own budget, {{incorporated}} into the Defence Academy's HQ Building - newly refurbished to accommodate them. Widely flagged {{as a means to}} preserve ARAG's capability, the Defence Academy's Director General, Lieutenant General Andrew Graham, told the staff that he was 'passionate about research' and that the capability was secure under his tenure. However less than three months later and despite having an annual budget of less than £1 million, ARAG was closed down in February 2010 by General Graham as a cost-saving measure. The move was widely condemned, with letters of protest being sent from government departments, the security services, former senior members of the US government, academia and other organisations. However ARAG and its new head had already made itself unpopular in Whitehall for pointing out the many failures of government departments and agencies as part of their 'red-teaming' function. R&AB also made itself unpopular within the Defence Academy itself - suggesting that whilst over 300 military officers graduated each year from the JSCSC Staff Courses there was no measure of effectiveness of the courses and no way to measure their value for money. R&AB staff also pointed out inconsistencies and failings of the various contracts and PFIs that existed in the Defence Academy. For example, despite Kings College London and SERCO receiving millions in public money, no online research papers were available to students - a basic research tool enjoyed by every other university in the UK - and basic administrative functions were hugely and disproportionately expensive. As a consequence many senior officers were reluctant to make a case for its retention. The comments from Kings College London Staff were particularly revealing. The BBC featured its demise, twice, in The World at One on 3 Feb 2010 and a large number of PQs were raised by various MPs. The answers provided by the then Minister for the Armed Forces, Bill Rammell, were confused and suggested that ARAG's functions would be handed to other organisations - a clear breach of negotiated Union arrangements and as such the basis of an ongoing dispute between the Defence Academy and the Prospect Union. Since the vast majority of ARAG and R&AB's work was undertaken in organic language analysis, it is unclear how such functions could be fulfilled by Kings College London or Cranfield University. In discussions with staff after the decision it became apparent that the senior management of the Defence Academy were unaware of much of the work R&AB had undertaken - a failing that many of the staff attributed to firstly Dr Macintosh, who in 2009 had inexplicably ceased the publication of all R&AB papers for nearly one year, and secondly to Lt General Graham who has taken a far less hands on approach with Defence Academy business than his predecessor Lieutenant General John Kiszely, who had been actively involved in many of ARAGs projects - instead creating a new 1 Star post (Army Brigadier Sean Crane) to help oversee the Academy's multimillion-pound business.|$|E

The directive established these factors as an aid for executive decision-making and not as criteria for supporting particular operations.

In January 2004, the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) completed a Risk Characterization Document (RCD) for hydramethylnon (Lim 2004). The RCD did not identify any exposure scenarios of concern. In 2003, the EPA approved a residue tolerance for hydramethylnon on pineapple. DPR subsequently issued a Risk Management Directive (RMD) requesting that staff base future scientific evaluations on the dietary exposure limits identified in the RCD (Gosselin 2004).

A {{public health}} {{assessment}} (PHA) for the Department of Energy 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (DOE) Hanford Site was released for public comment and independent peer review on October 16, 2006. Due {{to a lack}} of funding by DOE in fiscal year 2006, we were unable to respond to the comments we did receive on the PHA. A copy of the stakeholder letter sent in December 2005 is also attached at the end of Appendix F. Ultimately, DOE funding was restored and we were recently able to complete the PHA. If ATSDR receives data or information that would change our conclusion, we will update this evaluation. ATSDR is aware that the environmental data used to develop the PHA date to 2003. Although this is an unusual situation, ATSDR believes that the public has the right to see how we responded to Community and peer review comments. We hope you find the PHA informative.

30|$|By way of introduction, {{the paper}} {{described}} and briefly illustrated the eight functions {{that make up}} the package. Because researchers will in many circumstances use information from previous assessments for simulation purposes, the paper went on to demonstrate how LSA data can be generated from parameter estimates and design features of PISA 2012. Finally, a small simulation showed that using the default test assembly functions recovered known population proficiency parameters for two groups. Although we demonstrated the soundness of the package’s default settings, we expect users to rely on those default settings only for aspects of a given simulation design that are considered to be nuisances. For example, a study designed to examine the efficiency of various item block designs could rely on the default background questionnaire functions without loss of generality. Alternatively, a researcher interested in studying background questionnaire invariance across heterogeneousness populations might utilize many of the default test assembly functions. Otherwise, we generally assume that users will bring a set of known or plausible population parameters that will provide the basis for further investigations. We believe that lsasim can be a useful tool for operational test developers and basic and applied measurement researchers. As national and international <b>assessments</b> <b>branch</b> into new platforms and populations, it is important that researchers with a solid background in measurement and large-scale test design have a ready means for evaluating the performance of new and existing methods. Finally, as a reminder, the default PISA parameters that are included with lsasim are not intended to be used to infer anything about the 2012 PISA administration. Rather, they provide an illustrative example of a test design and associated parameters that approximates an operational setting.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{selecting}} a measurement method for productivity evaluation is one faced by many managers. There are many approaches advocated {{and used in}} firms today. As firms adopt productivity oriented management practices, and compare operating units in terms of performance, it becomes important to understand whether there are significant differences between alternative measurement procedures.;In this thesis the definition and measurement of productivity is explored {{from a number of}} disciplinary bases. Three different measurement methods, one of which is a new approach developed in part by this author, are applied to a sample of 125 branches of a Canadian financial intermediary, for each month of a six month study period. Branch productivity scores generated by these different methods are compared by Region, branch Size Group, and for the National sample as a whole. As a secondary area of interest, productivity scores are also correlated with return on assumed assets, a conventional measure used in the field site company, Canada Trust, to evaluate branch financial performance.;The results of the investigation demonstrate little agreement between measurement systems on productivity <b>assessment.</b> <b>Branches</b> that appeared highly productive under one measurement regime appeared significantly less so under other measurement systems, and vice versa. Also, productivity and financial performance correlations were low for all three measurement systems tested.;Two conclusions were reached. First, that managerial practice in organizational productivity measurement does not reflect the normative methodologies advocated in much of the productivity management literature. Second, that the selection of a productivity measurement system is an important managerial decision {{in the light of the}} fact that alternative methodologies generate conflicting evaluations of performance.
