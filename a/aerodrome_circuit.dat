50|$|In March 1961 McLean {{attended}} Rob Walker's Motor Racing Stables at Finmere <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>circuit</b> in England. He did {{the first}} three stages on his first trip and made a second trip to England where he completed the last three stages. At {{the completion of the}} seventeen-day training course, McLean turned the fastest ever student lap time. Students must progress from class six through to class one by meeting a steadily decreasing lap time requirement at each level.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, {{having been}} forced to leave Easton Neston after its sale by Lord Hesketh to Leon Max, and Max's {{intention}} to turn the stable block into a call centre for his Max Store clothing brand, Broom Engineering relocated to Turweston <b>Aerodrome</b> near Silverstone <b>Circuit.</b> However, just before the move, and {{at the point where}} most items were in packing crates, the premises were burgled with total value of £40,000 - including irreplaceable records, tools, and bikes. This slowed progress on the intended small scale production at the new location.|$|R
50|$|An <b>aerodrome</b> {{publishes a}} <b>circuit</b> height or pattern altitude, that is, a nominal level above {{the field at}} which pilots are {{required}} (recommended in the US, FAA AC90-66A Para. 8c) to fly while in the circuit. Unless otherwise specified, the standard recommended pattern height is 1000 ft AGL (above ground level), although a pattern height of 800 ft AGL is common. Helicopters usually fly the pattern at 500 ft AGL. Extreme caution must be exercised by pilots while flying at or through published traffic pattern altitudes as this might contribute to mid-air collisions.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Perranporth, Cornwall, elder son of Frederick (John Frederick) and Emma Healey (née Mitchell) who at {{that time}} ran a general store there, Donald Healey became {{interested}} in all things mechanical at an early age, most particularly aircraft. He studied engineering while at Newquay College. When he left his father bought him an expensive apprenticeship with Sopwith Aviation Company in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey and he joined Sopwith in 1914 continuing his engineering studies at Kingston Technical College. Sopwith had sheds at the nearby Brooklands <b>aerodrome</b> and racing <b>circuit.</b> Barely 16 when WW1 started, he volunteered in 1916 (before {{the end of his}} apprenticeship) for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and earned his [...] "wings" [...] as a pilot. He went on night bombing raids and served on anti-Zeppelin patrols and also as a flying instructor. Shot down by British anti-aircraft fire on one of the first night bomber missions of the war, after a further series of crashes he was invalided out of the RFC in November 1917 and {{spent the rest of the}} war checking aircraft components for the Air Ministry. After the Armistice he returned to Cornwall, took a correspondence course in automobile engineering and opened the first garage in Perranporth in 1920.|$|R
