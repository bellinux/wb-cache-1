2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the porthole <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Arizona's Governor Janet Napolitano {{visited the}} {{area at the}} time of the fire. [...] "This is a big, major fire, and it {{concerns}} us all," [...] she said. Regarding her aerial tour, the governor said, [...] "The fire looks a lot better today than it did a week ago. I flew over Mount Graham on July 4 <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see was smoke. Now, I can clearly see the perimeters the firefighters have been burning." [...] Napolitano provided for inmate wildland fire crews to provide fire suppression and forest thinning services.|$|E
2500|$|Green Day: Rock Band was {{generally}} well received by video game critics. Many critics noted the game follows the previous dedication to presentation, audio, and playability that {{were seen in}} The Beatles: Rock Band, though some believed it followed the formula too well to make it indistinguishable from the previous titles. Jack DeVries of IGN {{could not think of}} any easy way to identify the game from other Rock Band titles; [...] "People kept asking me how the game was <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think to say was 'It's Green Day: Rock Band.'" [...] Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica called the game [...] "paint by numbers rocking", commenting that the feature set is essentially the same as The Beatles. Patrick Klepek of G4TV stated the game was [...] "not as ambitious as The Beatles" [...] but still came to help him appreciate the band more.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had lots}} of things like Fan, I 'd have an auction <b>and</b> get <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> for them. Why don't you?" [...] asked Maud, {{beginning}} on her third bonnet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do! <b>I</b> {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, <b>and</b> then <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was still to keep silence.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>And</b> <b>all</b> the boxers <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{bring to}} the Kelligrews Soiree.|$|R
6000|$|Carl: [...] "Certainly is.... 'Member {{the time}} we had the May party at Adelaide's, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get for my basket was rag babies and May flowers? Gee, but I felt out of it!" ...|$|E
60|$|I remembered Wada's {{reports on}} this unseamanlike {{intimacy}} {{of the second}} mate with the gangsters, {{and tried to make}} out the nature of the conversation. But the gangsters were low-voiced, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> catch was the tone of friendliness and good-nature.|$|E
60|$|During {{this time}} I saw Steele twice, at night {{out in our}} rendezvous. He had little to communicate, but was eager to hear when I had seen Jim Hoden, Morton, Wright, Sampson, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell about them, and the {{significance}} of things in town.|$|E
60|$|February 26.--At home, {{and settled}} to work; but I know not why I {{was out of}} spirits--quite Laird of Humdudgeon, <b>and</b> did <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to shake it off, and could not. James Ballantyne dined with me.|$|R
6000|$|Thoughts hardly to {{be packed}} Into a narrow act, Fancies that broke thro' {{language}} <b>and</b> escaped: <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never be, <b>All,</b> men ignored in me, This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped. [...] 150 ...|$|R
60|$|It was an unequal struggle. Strong as I {{was for a}} boy of my age, I was {{no match}} for this burly man. Turn <b>and</b> twist <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> he held me in his grip while he heaped loud imprecations upon my head.|$|R
60|$|Of course I was puzzled; {{it was not}} in {{that fashion}} that I had {{expected}} Madame Blumenthal to make use of my information. But the matter now was quite out of my hands, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to bid my companion not work himself into a fever over either fortune.|$|E
60|$|If I {{had known}} {{there was any}} {{probability}} of rain I should have put on my coat before I started out on this somewhat unusual method of travelling, {{but there was no}} help for it now, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to hurry on. From walking fast I began to trot. The drops were coming down quite frequently.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{the only}} people here who don't, then," [...] said her daughter. [...] "The ladies were bowing right left to him all the time, and he kept asking if I knew this one and that one, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say was {{that some of them}} were distant cousins, but I wasn't acquainted with them. I would think he'd wonder who we were." ...|$|E
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; <b>and</b> it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from crying.|$|R
6000|$|A knot rose in {{my throat}} and paralysed awhile my speech. Then with a sudden sob, I sprang forward and hobbled to her upon my wounded feet. I flung myself down upon my knees, buried my head in her lap, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cry was: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, <b>and</b> it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do not to break the magician's commands.|$|R
60|$|He {{was gone}} {{even as he}} spoke, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do toward {{repairing}} what I believed to be serious mischief, was to lock and bar the door after him, saying to myself that if he failed to come back as he had promised, and aught suspicious was heard, I would insist that Archie and Harvey join me in flight, for then would Master Lord's house be the one place in Boston town where lurked the greatest danger for us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is in {{a terrible}} fright lest it should be Mr. Mohun. She got it into her head last autumn, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say would not persuade her out of it. Why, she always calls me Aunt Marianne when we are alone. Now, Reginald, here comes Maurice. Do not say anything, I beg and entreat. It is my secret, you know. I daresay you will all be told to-morrow,--indeed, mamma said so,--but pray say nothing about me or Jane. It was only settled {{yesterday}} evening.' ...|$|E
60|$|All this he boomed {{forth like}} a {{professor}} addressing his class. He had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me, and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids. Now he suddenly turned himself sideways, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see of him was tangled hair with a red, protruding ear. He was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk. He faced me presently {{with what looked like}} a very tattered sketch-book in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, most entirely, and I quite {{see that}} he is right---indeed I do, Gillian. People pretend to defer to a lady, but they really don't like her poking her nose in, <b>and,</b> after <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have no right to}} say anything. My only excuse for going was to take care of Fergus.' ...|$|R
60|$|June 15.--I laboured all the evening, {{but made}} little way. There were many books to consult; <b>and</b> so <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really {{do was to}} make out my task of three pages. I {{will try to make}} up the deficit of Tuesday to-day and to-morrow. Letters from Walter--all well. A visit {{yesterday}} from Charles Sharpe.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this time}} I {{was working at}} the Academie, <b>and</b> {{learning}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could....</b> One evening that we met, Paunitz was not there. Misek was telling us how the thing had been arranged. Schonborn and I looked at each other--it was warm--perhaps we were not hungry--it was springtime, too, and in the Spring it's different. There is something." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Upon my soul, I don't {{know what}} you mean! I DON'T know what I've done. When you came at me, last night, with my ring and {{presents}} and other little traps, you might have knocked me down with the lightest of the lot. I was perfectly dazed; I couldn't say anything before you were off, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to hope that you'd be more like yourself in the morning. And in the morning, when I came round to Mrs. Philips's, I found you were gone, and I came after you by the next train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Half an hour, sir. He {{was a very}} restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin' and a-stampin' all {{the time}} he was here. I was waitin' outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. At last he outs into the passage, and he cries, 'Is that man never goin' to come?' Those were his very words, sir. 'You'll only need to wait a little longer,' says I. 'Then I'll wait in the open air, for I feel half choked,' says he. 'I'll be back before long.' And with that he ups and he outs, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say wouldn't hold him back." ...|$|E
60|$|Doña Rita {{was curious}} to know how I got on with her peasant sister <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say in return for that inquiry was that the peasant sister was {{in her own way}} amiable. At this she clicked her tongue amusingly and {{repeated}} a remark she had made before: “She likes young men. The younger the better.” The mere thought of those two women being sisters aroused one’s wonder. Physically they were altogether of different design. It was also the difference between living tissue of glowing loveliness with a divine breath, and a hard hollow figure of baked clay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Great men are scarce. I'm {{content that}} my son has so far done his duty quietly <b>and</b> well; <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish for is that if any {{exceptional}} call should be made on him he should rise to the occasion. That is the supreme test, and men one expects much from sometimes fail to meet it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe laughed, but a long howl {{close by}} made me dive for a ham; {{for in the}} {{darkness}} of the woods the beasts had got closer, <b>and</b> now <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see were several balls of fire not many yards away. Out went the ham, and a snarling sound showed that the wolves were busy eating it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't say I pushed you over. It was Toglet, and {{directly}} after you disappeared {{he turned on}} me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to keep him at bay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] Cyril {{replied with}} a {{careless}} laugh. [...] "When I got off the train at the settlement, everybody stared at me, and there were anxious inquiries as to where I'd been. I promised {{to tell them about}} it another time, and at the livery-stable Kevan said something about my being killed. I told him it didn't look like it; and as the boys seemed determined on hearing my adventures; I rode off smartly. When I reached your place, Svendsen looked scared, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get out of him was that you were here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not so, Major Littlepage?" [...] cried {{this lovely}} creature, for very lovely she was, beyond all dispute; and {{feminine}} and delicate, and lady-like, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have wished her, had she {{only been a}} little less of a whig, {{and a good deal}} more of a tory; her eyes sparkling and flashing, at the same time, as if she felt all she was saying from the very bottom of her heart--"Is it not so, Major Littlepage?--America has come out of this war with imperishable glory; and her history, a thousand years hence, will be the wonder and admiration of all who read it!" ...|$|E
60|$|But when I turned around, {{and peered}} over the dark waters, {{it was quite}} plain {{to me that it}} was not want of oil, but {{increased}} distance, which made those lights so dim. I could now perceive but three of them, and as the surface was agitated only by a gentle swell, I could not suppose that any of them were hidden from our view by waves. We were being left behind, that was certain, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to row on as long and as well as I could in the direction which the other boats had taken. I had been used to rowing, and thought I pulled a good oar, and I certainly did not expect to be left behind in this way.|$|E
60|$|In keeping Peggotty company, <b>and</b> doing <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> for her (little {{enough at}} the utmost), I was as grateful, I rejoice to think, as even now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish myself to have been. But I am afraid I had a supreme satisfaction, of a {{personal}} and professional nature, in taking charge of Mr. Barkis's will, and expounding its contents.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said to myself, {{this man}} knows {{something}} I don't know. He's got {{the seeds of}} ete'nal life su'ely. I {{made up my mind}} then and the' I'd follow you and back you <b>and</b> do <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fo' you. I've lived fo' you. Eve' since.

6000|$|... "Oh! by Jingo!" [...] he ejaculated, [...] "oh! by Jingo!" [...] <b>and</b> {{that was}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get out of}} him, though it is true I did not try very hard at the time.|$|R
