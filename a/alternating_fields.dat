40|$|Summary. Rotational {{remanent}} magnetization, RRM, is the magnetization acquired when {{a sample}} is rotated during <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> demagnetization. Although {{the existence of}} RRM {{has been well documented}} in different laboratories, until now no physical mechanism explaining its origin has been given. We propose that the RRM originates from thermal fluctuations biased by a precessional torque associated with the <b>alternating</b> <b>field.</b> Our theory is consistent with the observation that no directional preference exists in the experimental situation until the sample is rotated relative to the <b>alternating</b> <b>field.</b> Moreover, our theory predicts that the combined sample rotation and precession will produce a RRM that switches direction when the frequency of sample rotation increases from any value below the frequency of the <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> to any value above that frequency as observed in experiments. Although no precise theory is given for the intensity of RRM, the model presented here can qualitatively explain previous intensity observations...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{time-dependent}} nonequilibrium Green's function method {{we investigate}} theoretically {{the time and}} spin-dependent transport through a graphene layer upon {{the application of a}} static bias voltage to the electrodes and a time-alternating gate voltage to graphene. The electrodes are magnetic with arbitrary mutual orientations of their magnetizations. We find features in the current that are governed by an interplay of the strength of the <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> and the Dirac point in graphene: The influence of a weak <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> on the zero bias conductance is strongly suppressed by the zero density of state at the Dirac point. In contrast, for a strong amplitude of the <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> the current is dominated by several resonant peaks, in particular a marked peak appears at zero bias. This subtle competition results in a transition of the tunnel magnetoresistance from a broad peak to a sharp dip at a zero bias voltage applied to the electrodes.

40|$|The {{currents}} of de and ac components and their phase-angle cosines for a superlattice under a direct bias and <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> are calculated with the balance equations.

With increasing <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> intensity the resonance peaks of higher harmonic increase, and simultaneously the first peak caused by the de field decreases. The results are in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating that this resonance can {{be understood in terms}} of electron acceleration within the miniband, i. e., it is a bulk superlattice effect, rather than caused by the electric-field localization mechanism (Wannier Stark ladder). The phase-angle cosine for the first harmonic cos phi(1) becomes negative when the Bloch frequency increases to be larger than the frequency of the ac field omega, and it also shows resonance peaks at the resonance frequencies n omega. The negative cos phi(1) may cause the energy transferred to the <b>alternating</b> <b>field,</b> i. e., oscillation of the system...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic fields {{emanate from}} radial tires {{due to the}} {{presence}} of reinforcing belts which are made of magnetized steel wire. When these tires spin, they generate alternating magnetic fields of extremely low frequency (ELF), usually below 20 Hz.

The static field of radial tires can exceed 500 mT at the tread, and the tire-generated <b>alternating</b> <b>fields</b> can exceed 2. 0 mT at seat level in the passenger compartment of vehicles. Degaussing the tires reduces both the static and <b>alternating</b> <b>fields</b> to low levels, but the fields increase gradually over time after degaussing.
