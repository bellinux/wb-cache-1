5|$|When researching for Birds of South Asia, Rasmussen {{examined}} tens {{of thousands}} of bird specimens, since the late S. Dillon Ripley had strongly favoured the use of museum specimens to determine which birds to include. With Robert Prys-Jones of the Natural History Museum, she showed that the decades-old Meinertzhagen fraud was far more extensive than first thought. Many of the 20,000 bird specimens in his collection had been relabelled with regard to where they were collected, and sometimes also remounted. The false documentation delayed the rediscovery of the forest owlet, since previous searches had relied on Meinertzagen's faked records. Rasmussen's successful expedition ignored these <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the areas identified by the remaining genuine specimens.|$|E
25|$|England's last {{recognised}} batting pairing, between Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones, saw England to lunch, but Flintoff {{had suffered}} {{an injury to}} his left shoulder <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> obvious pain, and Jones departed shortly after lunch. Giles lasted longer, batting through 45 minutes before he was caught by Hayden, and Harmison faced one delivery to leave England at 131 for 9.|$|E
25|$|So, {{with the}} score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, {{this time from}} Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The pair saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> obvious pain. In the first over after lunch, Jones gave an edge to Ponting – seven down for 101. Giles batted responsibly, padding up to Warne, but eventually {{felt the need to}} play at one, which Hayden held with relative ease. Harmison came and went, facing one delivery, and it was all up to Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to see England to a challenging target.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous crimes in the city took place in March 1953, when elderly widow Mabel Monahan was killed in her Burbank home. When Monahan, 64, {{opened the door to}} her house on West Parkside Avenue, she found herself confronted by a stranger, Barbara Graham (also {{sometimes}} referred to as Barbara Wood). Graham, along with some other accomplices, had heard rumors of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's front door <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. The gardener immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and half out of a closet.|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa has {{a unique}} Hispanic accent which Rosenblat created and puts on. She drew {{inspiration}} from her scripts and costume. When she first placed a wig cap <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the mirror she began to envision how her character should sound. Though {{it was not until}} she filmed later episodes that she made a decision. Rosenblat told Anna Silman from Vulture that it was a scene involving Miss Rosa and Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), in which she states [...] "I could have been the jefa". Rosenblat said that the Spanish word made her realize that her character is Hispanic and her dialect is indicative of something Latin.|$|E
500|$|First {{revealed}} in 2005, Powered Up {{was produced by}} series mainstay Keiji Inafune. It was released in a bundle alongside [...] (also for PSP) and was slated for release on the PSP's PlayStation Network (PSN). It was released for the PSN service in Japan, but a US release did not occur due to technical difficulties. The game uses a chibi-style that was intended for the original game but was not possible at the time. The designers intended to keep this design faithful {{to the way the}} characters worked <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the original. While it received generally positive reviews, the game sold poorly, and plans for a remake of Mega Man 2 titled Mega Man Powered Up 2 fell through.|$|E

2500|$|The New Zealand Company also {{established}} a settlement at Wanganui in 1840, chiefly as a spillover settlement, {{the site of}} the rural land promised to Wellington purchasers. A traveller in the colony at the time described Wanganui as [...] "one of the unwholesome, mushroom settlements engendered by the New Zealand Company for the purpose of removing to a distance a portion of the clamorous script-holders who, on arriving from England, looked, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> vain, for their land." [...] The Wanganui settlement was beset with problems when settlers arrived to find Māori on the land, denying it had been sold. [...] The company also sent surveyors down the east coast of the South Island to consider further sites, where they made contact at Akaroa with the fledgling French colony established there under the auspices of Jean-François Langlois's Nanto-Bordelaise Company.|$|E
2500|$|In reply, the Sixers {{had trouble}} {{of their own}} keeping wickets in hand. With regular opener Michael Lumb out for the game, Stephen O'Keefe partnered Nic Maddinson {{at the top of}} the order. Both looked to move the scores on but fell cheaply. Then when Moises Henriques and Marcus North both {{returned}} to the pavilion without troubling the scorers the Sixers were 4/20. Scorchers bowler Tim Behrendorff was the destroyer with 3/21 from his four overs. Steve Smith and Jordan Silk did some rebuilding of their own before Silk gifted Voges an easy return catch. Smith continued scoring runs <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> fine form as he reached his half century. The Sixers seemed like they would now easily make the runs. However, the game turned on its head once more when Dan Smith attempted to play a reverse sweep only to scoop the ball to fine leg. With the Scorchers eyeing off the Sixers tail-enders, Steve Smith took it upon himself to finish the game. A mistimed shot of the bowling of Yasir Arafat saw him caught at short third man by Voges with the Sixers 7/131. Lyon quickly departed and the Scorchers looked destined to win. However, the nineteenth over by Thomas saw some big hitting by Lee and Chris Tremlett leaving the Sixers with just 7 runs of the final over by Arafat to win. Neither side could quite find the slice of luck to get the win in ordinary time. With Lee out bowled, Tremlett faced the final delivery needing two runs to win. He dug out the ball from Arafat who couldn't quite hold onto out bumping it out to cover. The Sixers scampered through for a single leaving the scores tied.|$|E
