The Pro12 League game {{result was a}} win for the Cardiff Blues 22–15 <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> of 8,000. The following Tuesday, it was announced that the match against Ulster on Friday, 17 February, would also be at the Arms Park, resulting in a Blues win, 21–14 <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> of 8,600. The agreement signed during 2009 tied Cardiff Blues to a 20-year contract to play a maximum of 18 games per season for a set fee, rather than per match at Cardiff City Stadium. But on 23 February, it was announced that the two Welsh 'derbies' against the Scarlets and the Ospreys would be played at Cardiff City Stadium, rather than the Arms Park, because of Cardiff Blues' anticipation that the attendance figures would far exceed the maximum capacity of 9,000. On 8 May 2012, it was announced that Cardiff Blues would be returning to the Arms Park on a permanent basis after just three years at the Cardiff City Stadium.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} years, the congregation's {{financial}} situation was precarious. The building was located ten blocks from {{where most of}} the congregants and potential congregants lived (on Grand Street, near the ferry docks), <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> was low. Even on the High Holy Days, the sanctuary was rarely more than half full. The synagogue employed a rabbi, gabbai, and cantor, and annual expenses often exceeded the congregation's income (which came primarily from the sale of seats). To remain solvent, the congregation borrowed money against the equity in the building: $2,000 (today $) in 1888, and another $2,000 in 1894.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits. In 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles.

5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E

5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004.

It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders. Original projections of 300,000 admissions per year were never met. In October 2006, the museum announced plans to turn galleries into conference rooms, remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, the museum admitted guests free of charge, <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> and revenue increased. The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|E

In a 1997 interview, Breslin said that the most special charity he helped was one started by him and his wife. The Extra Effort program was started at Indian Trail Junior High School in Addison, where Jami was a teacher. Each month the program gave both a male and a female student four tickets to a Wolves game and a gift bag. The students were chosen based on attitude, effort <b>and</b> <b>attendance.</b> After retiring from professional hockey, he coached youth hockey and helped manage an Irish pub.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of the}} league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen Rasoherina (1863–68) the {{opportunity}} to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister—a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them. Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony (1864–95), who {{would go on to}} marry Queen Ranavalona II (1868–83) and Queen Ranavalona III (1883–97) in succession. Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government. Schools were constructed throughout the island <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> was made mandatory. Army organization was improved, and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers. Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace. Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British common law and three European-style courts were established in the capital city. In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.|$|E
5|$|As Antoine {{decided to}} model Antoinist {{holidays}} on Catholicism, followers celebrate Christian holidays, including All Saints, Christmas, Easter, Easter Monday and Ascension; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> at worship is generally higher at these moments: (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It {{was established by}} Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, from 1913, all the temples except the one in Jemeppe were closed {{that day in the}} purpose that followers came to attend the ceremony in that city. So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. That day, the faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples. (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple. In 1911, on that day, the General Operation took place at the temple, then the ceremony continued into a public hall, which shocked followers; therefore, the following year, the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple. (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.|$|E

40|$|There {{were two}} main {{purposes}} of this study. First, the study tried to determine if religion and occupation had affected school attendance in Newfoundland from 1901 to 1921. Second, the study attempted to show if religion, occupation <b>and</b> school <b>attendance</b> had affected literacy during the same period. [...] Arguments were presented providing a rationale for the conceptual model used in the study. These arguments indicated a positive association between the percent Protestant in a community and the percent of school <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> literacy, and a positive association between the percent of school <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> the percent of literacy. In addition, it was argued {{that there was a}} negative association between the percent fishermen in a community and the percent of school <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> literacy. [...] The sample consisted of 404 communities selected at random from the census return of Newfoundland for 1901. The same 404 communities were also selected in 1911 and 1921. Labrador District and the city of St. John’s were excluded from the sample. [...] The findings of the study are presented under five main headings: (1) religious composition and school attendance; (2) occupational composition and school attendance; (3) religious composition and literacy; (4) occupational composition and literacy; <b>and,</b> (5) school <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> literacy. [...] The hypothesized positive associations between the percent Protestant <b>and</b> school <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> literacy were not supported. Indeed, in communities over 200 in population, there was a consistent negative association between percent Protestant <b>and</b> school <b>attendance.</b> [...] Only in communities without teachers was there a consistent negative association between the percent fishermen <b>and</b> school <b>attendance.</b> When teachers were available, there appeared to be little relationship between occupation <b>and</b> school <b>attendance.</b> [...] The findings of the study supported both the hypothesis of a negative association between the percent fishermen and literacy, and the hypothesis of a positive association between school <b>attendance</b> <b>and</b> literacy. ...|$|R
