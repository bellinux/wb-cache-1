5|$|During {{the first}} series of Torchwood, the Torchwood website, located at torchwood.org.uk, recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an {{alternate}} reality game {{made up of}} electronic literature {{in the form of}} fictional intercepted blogs, newspaper cutouts and confidential letters <b>and</b> <b>IM</b> conversations between members of the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood. For the second series in 2008, a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures. The BBC America Torchwood also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Background: A radioprotective {{effect of}} low {{selenium}} doses on normal tissue {{and a possible}} radiosensitization of tumor cells at higher concentrations have been previously suggested. However, systematic experimental and clinical data are scarce. Materials and Methods: C 6 cells were cultured for 14 days at different selenite concentrations (0 ÌM, 2 <b>ÌM,</b> 3 <b>ÌM</b> <b>and</b> 3. 6 <b>ÌM)</b> <b>and</b> irradiated with 0 Gy to 20 Gy. Plating efficiency and survival were determined using the colony assay. Results: The overall radiosensitivity was low (D 0,control= 6. 1 Gy). Irradiated cells exposed to increasing selenite concentrations showed a lower plating efficiency and, for doses> 2 Gy, a lower survival than the control. For Se concentrations of 0 <b>ÌM,</b> 2 <b>ÌM</b> <b>and</b> 3 <b>ÌM,</b> respectively, SF 2 amounted to 0. 72, 0. 48 and 0. 46, and SF 5 to 0. 37, 0. 25 and 0. 12.

25|$|In the lead-up to the Candidates' Final in 1974, {{as part of}} a {{campaign}} to promote Karpov over Korchnoi, Tigran Petrosian made a public statement in the press against Korchnoi, with the Soviet federation, wishing to develop younger players, taking the stance that their generation (including Korchnoi) which had been defeated by Fischer could no longer hope to compete successfully against him. At the closing ceremony of the Candidates' Final, Korchnoi had made his mind up that he had to leave the Soviet Union. The central authorities prevented Korchnoi from playing any international tournaments outside the USSR.

25|$|With {{his victory}} over Petrosian, Korchnoi {{advanced}} to face Karpov in the Candidates' Final, the match {{to determine who}} would challenge reigning World Champion Bobby Fischer in 1975. In {{the run-up to the}} match, Korchnoi was constantly subjected to threats and harassment, and was virtually unable to find any Grandmasters to assist him. Bronstein apparently assisted Korchnoi, for which he was punished. Bronstein, in his last book, Secret Notes, published in 2007, wrote that he advised Korchnoi before the match began, but then had to leave to play an event himself; when he returned, Korchnoi was down by three games. Bronstein then assisted Korchnoi for the final stages. Korchnoi also received some assistance later in the match from two British masters, IM (later GM) Raymond Keene <b>and</b> <b>IM</b> William Hartston. Korchnoi trailed 3–0 late in the match, but won games 19 and 21 to make it very close right to the end. Karpov eventually won this battle, played in late 1974 in Moscow, by a 12½–11½ score. By default, Karpov became the twelfth world champion in April 1975, when Fischer refused to defend his title because of disputed match conditions.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{narrative}} approach, change in self-narratives {{is an important}} part of successful psychotherapy. In this view, several authors have highlighted the usefulness of narrating new experiences (like actions, thoughts, and stories) during therapy in contrast with maladaptive client self-narratives. These new experiences are termed here innovative moments (<b>IMs),</b> <b>and</b> different types can be specified: action, reflection, protest, reconceptualization, and performing change. With the aim of understanding which therapist skills are related to client IMs, we analyzed the association between exploration, insight, and action skills <b>and</b> <b>IMs</b> in two initial, two middle, and two final sessions of three good outcome (GO) and three poor outcome (PO) cases of emotion-focused therapy (EFT) for depression.

The antivenom can be given by injection intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The manufacturer recommends IM use, with IV administration reserved for life-threatening cases. In January 2008 toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister suggested IM antivenom was not as effective as IV antivenom, after proposing that IM antivenom took longer to reach the blood serum.

Because of these concerns, orders were issued to fire on Korean civilians in front-line areas, orders discovered decades later in declassified military archives.
