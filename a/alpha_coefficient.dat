Generally, researchers agree that a Cronbach's <b>alpha</b> <b>coefficient</b> above 0.80 suggests strong reliability in a scale.

30|$|The 12 -item {{neuroticism}} and extraversion {{subscales of}} the short-scale Eysenck Personality Questionnaire—Revised (EPQ-R; Eysenck et al. 1985) were used to measure personality variables. Higher scores represent higher levels of extraversion (sample item: “Are you a talkative person?”) and neuroticism (sample item: “Does your mood often go up and down?”). The EPQ-R is a well-validated measure with the neuroticism and extraversion subscales, in particular, being recognised as valid measures of their constructs (Eysenck and Eysenck 1991). Francis et al.

The Perceived Benefits of Caregiving scale includes 11 items with questions such as, [...] "Has caregiving given more meaning to your life?" [...] and [...] "Has caregiving made you feel important?" [...] There was an <b>alpha</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0.7 for this scale.

The American stock exchange market was analyzed. Six different segments of the capital market were selected ? gold, oil and gas pipelines, steel and iron, car parts, food and telecommunication services. Each segment was represented by eight companies. The general characteristics of the companies were compared according to their profits, degree of risk, <b>alpha</b> and beta <b>coefficients.</b> Fundamental analysis was used to monitor the correlation between future profits for 2012 and <b>alpha</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the period 2007 ? 2011.
