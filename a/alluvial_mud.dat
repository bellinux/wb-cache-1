2500|$|There is {{a fossil}} record of two adults and a 12.2meter (40ft) long {{juvenile}} that died {{together in the}} Late Jurassic epoch, approximately 150 million years ago (in northeast Wyoming, United States). It is assumed that their bodies were washed by a river in spate (flood) to their final resting place in <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud.</b> The scenario suggests that Camarasaurus traveled in herds or, at least, in family groups. At other sites fossil camarasaur eggs {{have been found in}} lines, rather than in neatly arranged nests as with some other dinosaurs, which [...] suggests that, like most sauropods, Camarasaurus did not tend its young.|$|E
6000|$|But, {{though the}} Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, {{or at least}} to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, {{declared}} for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud,</b> under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.

60|$|What {{is going}} on in Maggiore {{is going on}} equally in all the other sub-Alpine lakes of the Po valley. They are being {{gradually}} filled in, every one of them, by the aggressive mud sheet. The upper end of Lugano, for example, has already been cut off, as the Lago del Piano, from the main body; and the piano itself, from which the little isolated tarn takes its name, is the <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud</b> fiat of a lateral torrent--the mud flat, in fact, which the railway from Porlezza traverses for twenty minutes before it begins its steep and picturesque climb by successive zigzags over the mountains to Menaggio. Similarly the influx of the Adda at the upper end of Como has cut off the Lago di Mezzola from the main lake, and has formed the alluvial level that stretches so drearily all around Colico. Slowly the mud fiend encroaches everywhere on the lakes; and if you look for him when you go, there you can see him actually at work every spring under your very eyes, piling up fresh banks and deltas with alarming industry, and preparing (in a few hundred thousand years) to ruin the tourist trade of Cadenabbia and Bellagio.|$|E
50|$|The Kirtland Formation (originally the Kirtland Shale) is a {{sedimentary}} geological formation. It is {{the product}} of <b>alluvial</b> <b>muds</b> and overbank sand deposits from the many channels draining the coastal plain that existed on the inland seashore of North America, in the late Cretaceous period. It overlies the Fruitland Formation. It is found in the San Juan Basin in the states of New Mexico and Colorado, in the United States of America.|$|R
40|$|The Cihuela Carbonate unit {{is located}} {{in the eastern part of}} the Tertiary {{continental}} Almazan Basin, which is connected to the Duero Basin. This unit is 200 hundred metres thick and it consists of five increasing-upward carbonate sequences. Each megasequence is made up of a lower part of mudstones or marls, an upper carbonate part (calcitic and dolomitic facies) and transitional facies between the two. These sequences were formed in mud flats and in the associated ephemeral carbonate lakes with characteristic formation of interstitial gypsum during the frequent periods of exposure. The clay mineral species identified by X-ray diffraction are: illite, two types of smectite (Di and Trioctahedral), palygorskite, seplolite and minor kaolinlte, chlorite and mixed-layer chlorite-smectites. Illlte and dioctahedral smectite rich levels represent the detrltal material deposits of the distal <b>alluvial</b> fan (<b>mud</b> flat) without later transformations under saline influence. The Mg-smectite and palygorskite are ofdiagenetic origin, possibly formed by transformation of the detrltal phyllosillcates. Mg-smectites, which occurs exclusively In the mudstone layers interbedded with the dolomites In the first megasequence, were formed In the saline lakes. Palygorskite is recorded in the rest of the megasequences and it was formed in the mud flat, in conditions of lower salinit...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{coastline}} of north-western Kyushu, Japan, {{consisting of}} cliffs, steep-sided inlets and archipelagos, has resulted from subsidence in mountainous terrain; the region's populated river valleys,having narrow alluvial plains, often suffer rock avalanches. The Ainoura plain {{is one such}} alluvial plain. Excavation of the Monzen ruins on the Ainoura Plain by the Nagasaki Prefectural Board of Educationhas revealed the plain's geomorphic history regarding how the gravels and associated muds and sands were deposited during the last several thousand years. Regarding <b>alluvial</b> succession, <b>mud</b> and sand firstfilled in the trough, possibly {{as part of the}} transgression caused by the Holocene climatic optimum, and gravel later began to replace parts of the sand and mud layers by successive erosion and sedimentation,thereby raising riverbed level. It was confirmed that such conglomerate from the Ainoura plain was derived from the Hokusho landslide area in the hinterland because there is no conglomerate layer inthe Hino plain (a small plain southeast of the Ainoura plain). The Ainoura River's thalweg shows that the Monzen ruins are located at a sudden reduction in its gradient, thereby accounting for the thicknessof coarse clastic material in that area. The reconstructed Ainoura plain's paleoshoreline during the Holocene climatic optimum is also reported. The paleoshoreline did not move much until people beganto reclaim land; it would thus be expected that the similar deposition would happened on the Ainoura plain inside this paleoshoreline...|$|R
6000|$|Before I {{venture to}} say a word in {{distinct}} arrest of this judgment, I will give you a chart, as clear as the facts observed in the two previous lectures allow, of the state and prospects of the Saxons, when this violent benediction of conquest happened to them: and especially I would rescue, in the measure that justice bids, the memory even of their Pagan religion from the general scorn in which I used Carlyle's description of the idol of ancient Prussia as universally exponent of the temper of Northern devotion. That Triglaph, or Triglyph Idol, (derivation of Triglaph wholly unknown to me--I use Triglyph only for my own handiest epithet), last set up, on what is now St. Mary's hill in Brandenburg, in 1023, belonged indeed to a people wonderfully like the Saxons,--geographically their close neighbours,--in habits of life, and aspect of native land, scarcely distinguishable from them,--in Carlyle's words, a [...] "strong-boned, iracund, herdsman and fisher people, highly averse to be interfered with, in their religion especially, and inhabiting a moory flat country, full of lakes and woods, but with plenty also of <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud,</b> grassy, frugiferous, apt for the plough"--in all things like the Saxons, except, as I read the matter, in that 'aversion to be interfered with' which you modern English think an especially Saxon character in you,--but which is, on the contrary, you will find on examination, by no means Saxon; but only Wendisch, Czech, Serbic, Sclavic,--other hard names I could easily find for it among the tribes of that vehemently heathen old Preussen--"resolutely worshipful of places of oak trees, of wooden or stone idols, of Bangputtis, Patkullos, and I know not what diabolic dumb blocks." [...] Your English [...] "dislike to be interfered with" [...] is in absolute fellowship with these, but only gathers itself in its places of Stalks, or chimneys, instead of oak trees, round its idols of iron, instead of wood, diabolically vocal now; strident, and sibilant, instead of dumb.|$|E

However, this proved an inadequate support and did not prevent the building from sinking into the mud {{to such an extent}} that it had to be demolished decades later. Furthermore, <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud,</b> such as that at the hotel's site, amplifies seismic waves.|$|E
50|$|Mining in Gwennap is an {{industry}} stretching back to prehistoric times when tin streaming in the Carnon Valley {{is believed to have}} occurred. In surrounding valleys stones of cassiterite (SnO2) were washed downstream from outcropping lodes and trapped in the <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud</b> where they could be easily extracted. Later these outcropping tin lodes were worked by 'bounders' and the open workings (coffins) of these early miners are still partially visible at Penstruthal.|$|E
50|$|Below Makrai, {{the river}} flows between Vadodara {{district}} and Narmada district and then meanders through the rich plain of Bharuch district of Gujarat state. The banks are high between {{the layers of}} old <b>alluvial</b> deposits, hardened <b>mud,</b> gravels of nodular limestone and sand. The width of the river spans from about 1.5 km at Makrai to 3 km near Bharuch and to an estuary of 21 km at the Gulf of Cambay. An old channel of the river, 1 km to 2 km south from the present one, is very clear below Bharuch. The Karanjan and the Orsing {{are the most important}} tributaries in the original course. The former joins at Rundh and the latter at Vyas in Vadodara district of Gujarat, opposite each other and form a Triveni (confluence of three rivers) on the Narmada. The Amaravati and the Bhukhi are other tributaries of significance. Opposite the mouth of the Bhukhi is a large drift called Alia Bet or Kadaria Bet.|$|R
40|$|The {{thickness}} of the studied Quaternary alluvial complex, located {{in the eastern part}} of the Pannonian Basin System, can exceed 500 m. Based on subsurface facies analysis the following large-scale depositional elements were identified: channel-fill deposits, point bar deposits, alluvial fan (sandy sheet-flood) deposits, floodplain and floodbasin deposits, and thinner sandy–silty beds. They are classified into four types of facies associations, showing a characteristic stacking pattern on the logs. Facies zonation and basin-scale facies mapping of the overall Quaternary sedimentary succession shows that in several areas dominated by stacked, multistorey sandy channel fill sediments, pre-existing superimposed channel belts can be presumed. In the central and deepest part of the basin muddy floodbasin (distal floodplain and wetland) sediments dominate. Between these the largest area represents the floodplain where single channel fill sands are interbedded in the <b>alluvial</b> plain <b>muds.</b> In the eastern part of the basin the well-logs highlight the distal part of an alluvial fan where sandy sheet-flood deposits alternate with floodplain sediments. The recognized facies associations show a vertical pattern, i. e. they form a 40 – 100 m thick fining-upward fluvial cycle. The most characteristic and even ideal cycle can be observed in the channel belts and in the proximal floodplain zone. Here the basal member of the cycle is made up of multistorey channel fill beds cut into the underlying floodplain deposits. This is overlain by an alternating sandy–muddy succession of channel fill and floodplain deposits forming the intermediate member. The upper member is composed of silty–clayey floodplain deposits with occasional very thin, discrete silty–sandy bodies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{calculate}} spectral {{ratios for}} S waves and codas {{to evaluate the}} amplification of 14 sites in the southern San Francisco Bay area relative to a nearby bedrock site in the Coyote Hills. Our data are seismograms written by Loma Prieta aftershocks: the epicentral distances and azimuths to the stations are effectively the same. All the sites in the study are amplified with respect o the reference site at frequencies from 0. 5 to 7 Hz. The shapes of the S-wave and coda spectral ratios are similar, but the coda ratios are greater than the S-wave ratios {{by as much as}} a factor of 4. The difference is larger for sites on <b>alluvial</b> and bay <b>mud</b> deposits, particularly at frequencies around 1 Hz, sug-gesting the presence of waves trapped in the alluvial basin. In general, the length of the analysis window affects the S-wave spectral ratios for alluvial sites. Longer windows give ratios similar to coda ratios, apparently because these windows include more of the phases that contribute to the coda. We classify the sites according to their geological characteristics and surficial shear-wave velocities. For the S-wave ratios, the differences between the classes showed no systematic trend; the softest and hardest soil classes we consider have practically identical S-wave amplifications. The average coda ratios for the site classes clearly increase as the soil classes include slower and "softer " ma-terials. After correction for differences in reference sites, the coda amplifica-tions are very similar to the relative amplifications for these site classes esti-mated by Borcherdt and Glassmoyer (1992) from the strong-motion recordings of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake...|$|R

Because much of the coastal plain floods at high tide, efforts to dam and drain this area have gone on since the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of Nok terracotta sculptures is still unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is {{preserved in the}} form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is well known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud,</b> in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market.|$|E

5000|$|Physcomitrium is a genus of mosses, {{commonly}} called urn moss, that includes about 80 species {{and has a}} cosmopolitan distribution. The scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek words physa, meaning bladder, and mitrion, meaning little turban, which together refer to the urn-like calyptra. The common name is derived from its symmetrical, erect and urn-like capsules that lack peristomes, these features characterising the genus. They are commonly found on exposed soils that are often associated with locations that become very wet in the spring, such as along river banks or on <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud.</b> They occur from near sea level to about 2500 metres. The capsules mature over the winter and into the spring.|$|E
50|$|Sea-water {{may have}} been {{collected}} in tidally-fed sun pans cut into tidal channels to allow for solar evaporation {{in the initial stages}} of the process, although no such features have been positively identified. Instead, sea water seems to have been collected in the clay-lined settling tanks, which were submerged by the high-tide or were filled manually when the tide was lower. The depth of these tanks suggests that they were designed to allow the <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud</b> and other unwanted solids in the water to settle to the bottom, to be emptied out later. As this settling procedure could take several hours, having more than one tank allowed for them to be at different stages of the settling process, meaning that salt making could continue with little down-time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site of the}} {{sanctuary}} was first systematically excavated by a French team in 1829 then the German expedition headed by Georg Treu from 1875-81, and the results published in a 5 volume report by Ernst Curtius and Friedrich Adler, Olympia: Die Ergebnisse der von dem deutschen Reich veranstalteten Ausgrabung, 1892-7. The building and sculpture had been shattered by an earthquake in antiquity and subsequently partially reused as building material, the rest buried under <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud.</b> The early classical sculptures did not initially attract {{as much attention as}} the later works such as the Nike of Paionios.

50|$|Giao Thuy {{district}} lies in {{the tropical}} monsoon region, which has two distinct seasons. One hot and rainy season from April to October and a cold and dry season from November to March. The annual average temperature is 24 °C. The highest temperature in summer is 40.3 °C and the coldest temperature in winter is 6.8 °C. The average humidity is 84%. The annual rainfall is between 1700 mm and 1800 mm. Averagely there are 133 rainy days per year. Rain mainly falls in summer or winter. With 15-18 rainy days August is the month with the most rainfall in contrast to autumn and winter with the lowest rainfall (25-50 mm per month). From July to October the Red River is flooded, which influences the region {{as well as the}} northeast monsoon. In winter the wind mainly comes from the north and in summer from the east. July and August seem to be the stormiest months in the year where storms are followed by heavy rain. Three strong storms hit the north of Vietnam in 2005 (28 July one wind with level 7, 18 September with level 9 and on 28 September with level 12). There are two types of soil formed from the alluvium of the Red River. One is <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud</b> (which becomes loam) and one is sand. Transported by water the alluvial forms the coastal soil like light soil (sand and light loam and pure sand), medium soil and heavy soil (loam and clay).|$|E

40|$|The Haihe {{cohesive}} sediment, {{which is}} typical in China, is studied systematically for its basic physical and incipient motion properties. Following {{the requirements of}} dredging works in the Haihe Estuary, cohesive sediment samples were taken from three locations. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the rheological properties of these samples and to examine the incipient motion of the cohesive sediment. It is found that the cohesive sediment has an obvious yield stress τb, which increases with the mud density {{in a manner of}} an exponential function, and so does the viscosity parameter η. The cohesive sediment behaves like a Bingham fluid when its density is below 1. 38 ∼ 1. 40 g/cm 3, and when denser than these values, it may become a power-law fluid. The incipient motion experiment also revealed that the incipient velocity of the cohesive sediment increases with the density in an exponential manner. Therefore, the incipient motion is primarily related to the density, which is different from the case for non-cohesive sediment in which the incipient motion is correlated with the diameter of sand particles instead. The incipient motion occurs in two different ways depending on the concentration of mud in the bottom. For sufficiently fine particles and a concentration lower than 1. 20 g/cm 3, the cohesive sediment appears as fluidized mud, and the incipient motion {{is in the form of}} instability of an internal wave. For a higher concentration, the cohesive sediment appears as general quasi-solid-mud, and the incipient motion can be described by a series of extended Shields curves each with a different porosity for newly deposited <b>alluvial</b> <b>mud.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
