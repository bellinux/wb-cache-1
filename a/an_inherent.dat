5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. <b>An</b> <b>inherent</b> part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> {{capacity for}} abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

5|$|The coastal lowlands, {{particularly}} surrounding Charleston and New Orleans {{and which}} also included {{much of the}} Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, more varied diet was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, {{as well as the}} French. Rice played a large part in the diet. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today. Although the English had <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> disdain for French food as well as many of the native foods, the French had no such disdain for indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they expressed an appreciation for native ingredients and dishes.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>an</b> <b>inherent,</b> {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} toolkit for the Motorola CPU {{included a}} compiler for the C programming language, {{which the two}} programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program Marble Madness in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of 30Hz instead of the normal 60Hz frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball's design had <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and {{the use of a}} regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM-based sprites to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less-advanced system using ROM-based, static sprites.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as <b>an</b> <b>inherent</b> part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E
