40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the biomechanical {{properties of the}} fixation of the long head of the biceps brachii into the humeral bone with suture <b>anchors,</b> interference screw, <b>and</b> soft <b>tissue</b> suture, comparing strength, highest traction load, and types of fixation failure. METHODS: Thirty fresh-frozen sheep shoulders were used, separated into three groups of ten for each technique. After fixation, the tendons were subjected to longitudinal continuous loading, obtaining load-to-failure (N) and displacement (mm). RESULTS: The mean load-to-failure for suture anchors was 95 ± 35. 3 N, 152. 7 ± 52. 7 N for interference screw, and 104. 7 ± 23. 54 N for soft tissue technique. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p < 0. 05), with interference screw demonstrating higher load-to-failure than suture anchor fixation (p = 0. 00307) <b>and</b> soft <b>tissue</b> (p = 0. 00473). The strength of interference screw was also superior when compared with the other two methods (p = 0. 0000127 and p = 0. 00000295, respectively). There were no differences between suture <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>tissue</b> technique regarding load-to-failure (p = 0. 9420) and strength (p = 0. 141). CONCLUSION: Tenodesis of the long head of the biceps brachii with interference screw was stronger than the suture <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>tissue</b> techniques. The other two techniques did not differ between themselves...|$|R
40|$|Most arthroscopic {{rotator cuff}} {{reconstruction}} techniques require {{a method of}} securing the tendon to the bone to obtain a stable construct. The available options include knotless technology and suture welding, but the most common method uses suture <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> knots. <b>Tissue</b> quality, surgical technique, repair material, and tension overload influence the stability of tissue repair. Arthroscopic knots are technically demanding because they are tied through cannulas with long-handled knot pushers. The strength of the repair is also influenced by the suture material used. In this study, we review the state-of-the-art of arthroscopic knots and suture materials being used for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair...|$|R
40|$|Intercellular {{anchoring}} junctions {{are highly}} specialized {{regions of the}} plasma membrane where members of the cadherin family of transmembrane adhesion molecules on opposing cells interact through their extracellular domains, and through their cytoplasmic domains serve as a platform for organizing cytoskeletal <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> remodelers. Here we focus on assembly of so-called “anchoring ” or “adhering ” junctions—adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes (DSMs), which associate with actin and intermediate filaments, respectively. We will examine how the assembly and function of AJs and DSMs are intimately connected during embryogenesis and in adult cells <b>and</b> <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> in some cases even form specialized “mixed ” junctions. We will explore signaling and trafficking machineries that drive assembly and remodeling and how these mechanisms are co-opted in human disease. In multicellular organisms intercellular junc-tions serve to maintain cell <b>and</b> <b>tissue</b> polarity <b>and</b> integrity. In vertebrates these organelles include: gap junctions, which chemically and electrically couple neighboring cells; tight junctions, which are essential for establishin...|$|R

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of clinically successful rotator cuff repairs are left with residual deficiencies in the cuff itself. 8, 9 Suture anchor fixation for rotator cuff repairs has gained popularity in the recent past. Several studies have investigated the biomechanical characteristics of rotator cuff repairs {{in an effort to}} identify possible sites of failure. These sites have included failure via suture cutting through bone tunnels, suture breakage, knot slippage, suture <b>anchor</b> pullout, <b>and</b> soft <b>tissue</b> failure at the suture-tendon junction. Meyer et al 11 recently detailed that suture breakage at the anchor eyelet may in fact be a significant concern for the strength of soft tissue repairs using suture anchors. They tested 22 different metallic suture anchors loaded with No. 2 braided nonabsorbable suture material. In every case, the suture broke at the anchor eyelet at up to 73 % lower loads than when the suture was tested on a smooth hook. We hypothesized that a previously unrecognized phenomenon {{may play a role in}} the failure mode of rotator cuff repairs: varying the depth of suture anchor insertion. Two variables may play a role in exposing the suture/anchor eyelet to untoward forces. First, Roth et al have shown that anchors inserted into the glenoid settle to the cortical surface with cyclic loading. 14 This settin...|$|R

40|$|Topobiology {{posits that}} {{morphogenesis}} {{is driven by}} differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations. This paradigm has been revised to include force-dependent molecular switches, cell <b>and</b> <b>tissue</b> tension, <b>and</b> reciprocal interactions with the microenvironment. It is now appreciated that tissue development is executed through conserved decision-making modules that operate on multiple length scales from the molecular and subcellular level through to the cell <b>and</b> <b>tissue</b> level <b>and</b> that these regulatory mechanisms specify cell <b>and</b> <b>tissue</b> fate by modifying the context of cellular signaling and gene expression. Here, we discuss the origin of these decision-making modules and illustrate how emergent properties of adhesion-directed multicellular structures sculpt the tissue, promote its functionality, and maintain its homeostasis through spatial segregation <b>and</b> organization of <b>anchored</b> proteins <b>and</b> secreted factors and through emergent properties of tissues, including tension fields and energy optimization...|$|R
