The squad hijacks a Covenant dropship, but instead of leaving the city, Buck decides to have them turn back and find Dare.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

A settlement was reached and, as a result, Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles. Consequently, the NFL became the first professional coast-to-coast sports entertainment industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{restriction}} on weight meant the torpedo {{could not be}} fired from a torpedo tube, but instead was carried in a rear-facing trough. On firing it was pushed backwards by a cordite firing pistol and a long steel ram, entering the water tail-first. A trip-wire between the torpedo and the ram head would start the torpedo motors once pulled taut during release. The CMB would then turn hard over <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its path. There is no record of a CMB ever being hit by its own torpedo, but in one instance the firing pistol was triggered prematurely and the crew had a tense 20 minutes close to the enemy whilst reloading it.|$|E

Paul's first experiences with hockey came {{at a young age}} {{in the basement of a}} Chinese restaurant operated by Charlie Chin, an immigrant who settled in Lucknow. Henderson played with Chin's sons using a ball instead of a puck. [...] The Chin family bought Henderson his first set of hockey equipment; he had been using old catalogues as shin pads. His father coached his youth teams, and at one minor hockey tournament, told his teammates simply to [...] "just give the puck to Paul <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his way". That incident remained with Henderson throughout his life: while it embarrassed him at the time to be singled out in front of his friends and teammates, he later realized it stood as an affirmation and expression of his father's pride in him and his abilities.|$|E

500|$|To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took {{a low-key}} {{approach}} to promoting In Utero; the company's {{head of marketing}} told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy {{similar to that of}} Nevermind, and explained that the label would [...] "set things up, duck, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way". [...] The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. [...] In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Uteros singles commercially in the United States. [...] DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, [...] "Heart-Shaped Box", to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. [...] Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind. [...] Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, [...] "We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much." ...|$|E

The game includes [...] "bank cards" [...] and keeps track of players' assets electronically, as {{was introduced in the}} [...] "Electronic Banking Edition" [...] earlier in the decade. The game also features clear plastic playing pieces for movers, and electronic sound effects, triggered by certain events (for instance, a [...] "jail door slam" [...] sound effect when a player goes to jail). Monopoly Live was announced at the New York Toy Fair in February, 2011. The Monopoly Millionaire version of the game was released in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|... 1986 {{was also}} the year that the racing variant, the Porsche 961, made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driven by René Metge partnering Claude Ballot-Léna, it {{finished}} first in its class and 7th overall. It returned in 1987 but failed to finish after a spin (missed gear change) while in 11th place by Canadian/Dutch driver Kees Nierop of Vancouver. Upon rejoining the track the car was observed on TV monitors in the Porsche pits to be on fire and the driver was told to stop <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car. Sadly Nierop pulled over between marshal stations and this extra time taken {{to get to the}} car by the marshals allowed the fire to consume most of the rear end and destroy the car. Thus ended the career of the 961. It was later repaired and put on display at the Porsche Museum.|$|E
2500|$|In World War I, shell shock was {{considered}} a psychiatric illness resulting from injury to the nerves during combat. The horrors of trench warfare meant that about 10% of the fighting soldiers were killed (compared to 4.5% during World War II) and the total proportion of troops who became casualties (killed or wounded) was 56%. Whether a shell-shock sufferer {{was considered}} [...] "wounded" [...] or [...] "sick" [...] depended on the circumstances. [...] When faced with the phenomenon of a minority of soldiers mentally breaking down, there was an expectation that the root of this problem lay in character of the individual soldier, not {{because of what they}} experienced on the front lines during the war. These sorts of attitudes helped fuel the main argument that was accepted after the war and going forward that there was a social root to shell shock that consisted of soldiers finding the only way allowed by the military to show weakness <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the front, claiming that their mental anguish constituted a legitimate medical diagnosis as a disease. [...] The large proportion of World War I veterans in the European population meant that the symptoms were common to the culture.|$|E
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
