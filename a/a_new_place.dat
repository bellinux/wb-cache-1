5|$|After {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978), the band {{separated from their}} manager Bernard Rhodes. This separation meant that the group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music. Tour manager Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker had found the group <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to rehearse called Vanilla Studios, which was located {{in the back of}} a garage in Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|Wheelwright's stay in Exeter was short-lived, however, as the Bay Colony {{planted a}} {{settlement}} at Hampton, which included Wheelwright's purchase in its jurisdiction, and this put the banished Wheelwright in Massachusetts territory. He then {{began looking for}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to settle, {{and two of his}} partners from the 1638 purchase, Samuel Hutchinson and Nicholas Needham, began prospecting the region to the northeast. On 24 September 1641 they obtained a license from Thomas Gorges, the deputy governor of Maine, for a property that became Wells, Maine.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking {{him to return to}} Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{found the}} short skirt {{convenient}} during her travels and defended it {{against those who}} {{said it was a}} distraction that hurt the women’s rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew whenever she arrived in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place.</b> In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February, 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{founding}} of the Gophers men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration. The University's student newspaper at the time, the Ariel, reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport {{was introduced to the}} campus from a rival school, Minnesota A in St. Paul, later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to play. In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the basketball program, and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke {{was one of the first}} full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.|$|E

5|$|Three {{months after}} the birth of their baby, Adam is made redundant. He gets a new job, but then he and Rachel are told that after the death of their {{landlord}} they will be evicted from their house. As they search for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to live, Adam's estranged father, Bill (Ian McElhinney), arrives. Bill and Adam patch up their relationship and he offers Adam and Rachel the money to buy their own house. On the way to the auction, Rachel is killed in a car crash, leaving Adam devastated. Her ashes are scattered in the final episode. Karen and David are going through an amicable divorce but when she starts seeing Mark again and David starts seeing his new lawyer Robyn (Lucy Robinson), it escalates, as they begin using each other's adultery and her alcoholism as a basis for custody of the children. Karen stops seeing Mark and the divorce cools down. Both re-evaluate their lives after Rachel's death; David develops his relationship with Robyn and Karen plans a trip with Ramona. Pete and Jo's marriage deteriorates when she sleeps with a co-worker (Richard Armitage) on a work weekend away. Jenny returns from New York in Episode 4 and moves back in with Pete after he asks Jo for a divorce.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually pulls himself together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and take it from there. The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets comfort from Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that they shared a kiss, they realise {{that they are not}} right for each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised by the arrival of her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E
25|$|France's {{intervention}} in Canadian intergovernmental relations remained {{largely in the}} realm of diplomatic rhetoric. Indeed, as Quebec, under the reformist Liberal government of Jean Lesage, was turning away from a more isolationist past and attempting to find for itself <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> within the Canadian federation and the wider francophone world, a willing and enthusiastic de Gaulle was eager to give aid to Quebec's newfound nationalist ambitions.|$|E

25|$|Some {{bonds are}} callable, meaning {{that even though}} the company has agreed to make {{payments}} plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> for their money, and the investor {{might not be able to}} find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael, {{along with}} their master Splinter, are living with April O'Neil while they look for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to live {{following}} the events of their last adventure.

At a junkyard where the remnants of The Foot and Shredder's second-in-command Tatsu are hiding out, they are met by their master, who has been disfigured by his previous defeat but did not die as they thought.|$|E

25|$|An Idiot Abroad is {{a travel}} {{documentary}} produced by Gervais and Merchant where a reluctant Pilkington travels {{around the world}} and his reactions to people and places is recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and Merchant call him to surprise him with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to visit or a task to do. Pilkington reports back to them and mostly complains about the situation he is in. Gervais said there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend around recording many hours of film which Gervais edits down to about an hour each episode.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Stephen Bernard Dorsey, Founder and President of Canadian company Automatic Electronic Systems (AES), {{introduced}} the world’s first programmable word processor {{with a video}} screen. The real breakthrough by Dorsey’s AES team was that their machine stored the operator’s texts on magnetic disks. Texts could be retrieved from the disks simply by entering their names at the keyboard. More importantly, a text could be edited, for instance a paragraph moved to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place,</b> or a spelling error corrected, and these changes were recorded on the magnetic disk.|$|E
25|$|The Temple of Mars Ultor, {{dedicated}} in 2 BC in {{the center}} of the Forum of Augustus, gave the god <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> of honor. Some rituals previously conducted within the cult of Capitoline Jupiter were transferred to the new temple, which became the point of departure for magistrates as they left for military campaigns abroad. Augustus required the Senate to meet at the temple when deliberating questions of war and peace. The temple also became the site at which sacrifice was made to conclude the rite of passage of young men assuming the toga virilis ("man's toga") around age 14.|$|E

25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To {{increase the number of}} jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing to take the risk of moving to and buying a home in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> that might not last.|$|E
25|$|The United States Grand Prix {{had a new}} destination, {{this time}} in the hot desert city of Phoenix, Arizona. It was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place,</b> but the same old dirty and dusty street circuits, and while {{considerably}} wider, faster and less bumpy than both Detroit and Dallas, the mostly right angled turns gave the drivers few reference points for when to use their brakes. The dreadfully hot 100+ degree dry desert summer heat of Phoenix also made conditions trying; the track broke up during the race. Senna made the most of his skill and scored another pole, Prost again playing second fiddle by over a second. Prost though believed that his race set up was superior to his team mate's and was confident of winning his first Grand Prix of the year.|$|E
25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>place</b> to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out for a little while longer the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E
