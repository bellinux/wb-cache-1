5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of Goofus and Gallant have {{also appeared in}} contexts divorced from the comic. Philosopher Theodore Sider used the characters in an argument against {{the notion of a}} binary Heaven or Hell conception of the afterlife. Sider conceived of Goofus and Gallant as near-equals, with Gallant only marginally better than Goofus, in arguing that sending the former to Heaven and the latter to Hell is <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> God's justice. Other philosophers such as Matthew Konieczka and Casey Swank have also called upon Goofus and Gallant as archetypes of bad and good when formulating arguments.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

50|$|Hungarian socialist and {{political}} economist Karl Polanyi made the <b>antithetical</b> argument <b>to</b> Hayek {{in the book}} The Great Transformation.

5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the second {{principle}} is equally true. Secrecy in government is <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> democratic governance. Too much secrecy shields officials from oversight and inevitably breeds abuse and misconduct; it thus can fatally weaken {{the system of}} checks and balances that defines our system of government.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal reforms {{received}} {{criticism from}} those who saw this level of government action to mitigate social evils as interfering with market forces and thus being <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the operations of a free market.

The cost of the reforms was also criticised and there were also critics who suggested that the reforms would not work in practice.|$|E

A richer understanding of Webern began {{to emerge in the}} later half of the 20th century, notably in the work of scholars Kathryn Bailey, Julian Johnson, Felix Meyer, Anne Schreffler, as archivists and biographers (e.g., Hans and Rosaleen Moldenhauer) gained access to sketches, letters, lectures, audio recordings, and other articles of or associated with Webern's estate.|$|E

Jin stresses the themes of standing up for one’s self and not letting the powerful and corrupt destroy one’s dreams. The book also contains universal and humanitarian theme of lending a helping hand to aid one's fellow man.|$|R

It had resisted soaps as <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> its quality image, but began broadcasting Front Line Family in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II. The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, The Archers, which has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.|$|E
25|$|If these {{comments}} were, indeed, spoken by Mr. Pelini, we are extremely disappointed, {{but it only}} reaffirms the decision that he should {{no longer be a}} leader of young men at Nebraska. His habitual use of inappropriate language, and his personal and professional attacks on administrators, are <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the values of our university. His behavior is consistent with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university and, most concerning, our student-athletes. This behavior is not tolerated at the University of Nebraska and, among many other concerns, played a role in his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Fascism {{emphasizes}} both palingenesis and modernism. In particular, fascism's nationalism {{has been}} identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence. Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> national regeneration. Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence. Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly Fordism and scientific management. Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst Jünger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis.|$|E

By contrast, American federal courts are obliged to respect agencies’ statutory-interpretive autonomy, but take a rigorous “hard look” at substantial agency factual determinations. This Article argues that the <b>antithetical</b> approaches <b>to</b> judicial review of administrative action adopted by the apex courts of the United Kingdom and the United States can be adequately explained by the polarization of these two polities along a spectrum of effective vetogates. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Ai Weiwei {{has emerged as}} a {{prominent}} artist activist in China. He is recognized across the globe for his dissident perspectives and large-scale art projects.

However, while remaining a highly critical of state policy, Ai’s actions recall Maoist political strategies. As such, this paper endeavors to better understand Ai’s emergence as a public figure and political activist in the reform era through the legacies of high socialism and the relevance of such legacies within contemporary China...|$|R
25|$|Tacitus cites some of {{his sources}} directly, among them Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder, who had written Bella Germaniae and a {{historical}} work which was the continuation of that of Aufidius Bassus. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (epistolarium). He also took information from exitus illustrium virorum. These were a collection of books by those who were <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the Stoic theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example Cremutius Cordus' speech in Ann. IV, 34-35.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{responded to}} the Iranian government's accusations by stating {{that there has been}} no {{evidence}} of Iran's claims and that the Bahá'í community in Iran professes its allegiance to the state. The United Nations pointed to the Bahá'í teaching of obedience to the government of one's country and stated that any involvement in any subversive acts against the government would be <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> precepts of the Bahá'í religion. The United Nations also stated that if the Iranian government did acknowledge that the Bahá'í Faith is a religion, it would be an admission that freedom of religion does not apply to all in Iran and that it is not abiding by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights to which it is a signatory.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides and Nachmanides {{differed}} {{about the}} reason for the sacrificial system. Maimonides wrote that {{the reason for}} the offerings was because when the Israelites lived in Egypt and Chaldea, the Egyptians worshipped sheep and the Chaldeans worshipped demons in the form of goats. And people in India never slaughter cattle. Thus God commanded the Israelites to slaughter cattle, sheep, and goats to God, so that worshipers of the other lands would know that God required the very act that they considered to be the utmost sin, and through that act God would forgive Israel's sins. God thus intended to cure the people of the other nations of false beliefs, which Maimonides characterized as diseases of the soul, for diseases are healed by medicines that are <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the diseases.|$|E

After discussing Borges's and Bolaño's formative years as writers, during which both openly and self-consciously endorse a Joycean aesthetic, it argues that, as Borges and Bolaño gradually shift from the youthful tone of their early writings to the fictional canonicity of their later prose, their attitudes towards Joyce develop accordingly. Borges showcases his aesthetic of brevity as the <b>antithetical</b> response <b>to</b> Joyce's epic legacy.

25|$|As Penn became homeless, {{he began}} to live with Quaker families. Quakers were {{relatively}} strict Christians in the 17th century. They refused to bow or take off their hats to social superiors, believing all men equal under God, a belief <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> an absolute monarchy which believed the monarch divinely appointed by God. Therefore, Quakers were treated as heretics because of their principles and their failure to pay tithes. They also refused to swear oaths of loyalty to the King. Quakers followed the command of Jesus not to swear. The basic ceremony of Quakerism is silent worship in a meeting house, conducted in a group. There was no ritual and no professional clergy, and many Quakers disavowed the concept of original sin. God's communication comes to each individual directly, and if so moved, the individual shares their revelations, thoughts or opinions with the group. Penn found all these tenets to sit well with his conscience and his heart.|$|E
25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is <b>antithetical</b> <b>to</b> the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E

40|$|Through {{engagement}} {{with a range}} of recent publications, this article offers a mini-ethnography of wonder discourses in the anthropology of ontology, leading to a rethink of the concept of religion. It has sometimes been suggested that science and religion are <b>antithetical</b> orientations <b>to</b> the experience of wonder: whereas science seeks to banish wonder by replacing it with knowledge, religion remains open to wonder {{in the face of the}} unknowable. With this criterion of difference in view, this article identifies certain trends in the anthropology of ontology that appear to enjoin and pursue open-ended wonder in ways that might be read as constituting anthropology as religious science.
