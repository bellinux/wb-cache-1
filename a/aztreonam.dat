2500|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} usually treated with {{antibiotic}}s. However, the antibiotic sensitivities of different strains of E. coli vary widely. As gram-negative organisms, E. coli {{are resistant to}} many antibiotics that are effective against gram-positive organisms. Antibiotics which {{may be used to}} treat E. coli infection include amoxicillin, as well as other semisynthetic penicillins, many cephalosporins, carbapenems, <b>aztreonam,</b> [...] trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and the aminoglycosides.|$|E
2500|$|In general, an isolate is {{suspected}} {{to be an}} ESBL producer when it shows in vitro susceptibility to the second-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefotetan) but resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and to <b>aztreonam.</b> Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported in vitro susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as [...] "resistant" [...] to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and <b>aztreonam,</b> {{even if it is}} tested (in vitro) as susceptible. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as well as high frequency of co-existence of fluoroquinolone resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam in vitro inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. Cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. In vivo studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. (Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated in vitro stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, carbapenems are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent in vitro activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people with}} CF are {{on one or}} more {{antibiotics}} at all times, even when healthy, to prophylactically suppress infection. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or a noticeable decline in lung function is seen, and are usually chosen {{based on the results}} of a sputum analysis and the person's past response. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent IV such as a peripherally inserted central catheter [...] or Port-a-Cath. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin, colistin, and <b>aztreonam</b> is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria. Inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection, but also has significant drawbacks such as development of antibiotic resistance, tinnitus, and changes in the voice. Inhaled levofloxacin may be used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis who are infected.|$|E
2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam <b>aztreonam),</b> but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the family}} {{commonly}} express plasmid-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, {{a new group of}} enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979). The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals. ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam <b>aztreonam.</b> Thus ESBLs confer multi-resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. [...] A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. [...] The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily ertapenem resistant) isolates have recently been reported. [...] ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. [...] However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aztreonam</b> {{is similar}} in action to penicillin. It {{inhibits}} mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thereby blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking. It has a very high affinity for penicillin-binding protein-3 and mild affinity for penicillin-binding protein-1a. <b>Aztreonam</b> binds the penicillin-binding proteins of Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria very poorly and is largely ineffective against them. <b>Aztreonam</b> is bactericidal, but less so {{than some of the}} cephalosporins.|$|E
50|$|Acinetobacter anitratus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis are {{generally}} susceptible to <b>aztreonam,</b> while some staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hemolyticus and Xanthomonas maltophilia {{are resistant to}} it.

50|$|Reported {{side effects}} include {{injection}} site reactions, rash, and rarely toxic epidermal necrolysis. Gastrointestinal side effects generally include diarrhea and nausea and vomiting. There may be drug-induced eosinophilia. Because of the unfused beta-lactam ring unique to <b>aztreonam,</b> there is somewhat lower cross-reactivity between <b>aztreonam</b> {{and many other}} beta-lactam antibiotics, {{and it may be}} safe to administer <b>aztreonam</b> to many patients with hypersensitivity (allergies) to penicillins and nearly all cephalosporins. However, like other beta lactams, there is a risk of very serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The <b>aztreonam</b> label directs physicians {{to be aware of the}} possibility of these severe adverse reactions. This is more likely if the patient is allergic to a certain cephalosporin known as ceftazidime. Azetreonam exhibits cross-reactivity with this cephalosporin due to a similar side chain.

50|$|Initial empiric {{therapy for}} CSF shunt {{infection}} should include broad coverage that includes gram-negative aerobic bacilli including pseudomonas and gram-positive organisms including Staph aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus, {{such as a}} combination of ceftazidime and vancomycin.

5000|$|<b>Aztreonam</b> {{is poorly}} absorbed when given orally, {{so it must}} be {{administered}} as an intravenous or intramuscular injection (trade name Azactam [...] ), or inhaled (trade name Cayston) using an ultrasonic nebulizer.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the syn-configuration of the imino side chain, compared to other third-generation cephalosporins, the more complex moiety (containing two methyl and a carboxylic acid group) confers extra stability to β-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria.

[...] For theoretical reasons, infection would not be expected to respond to penicillins, cephalosporins, or <b>aztreonam,</b> although carbapenems like meropenem or imipenem may possibly work. Though the bacteria is reported to be resistant to first generation cephalosporins, susceptibility to the newer cephalosporins is variable.|$|E
50|$|Historically, C. hominis {{has been}} {{sensitive}} to penicillin and penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin.

Clinical guidelines thus recommend that C. hominis and other HACEK organisms be presumed to harbor ampicillin resistance and therefore be treated with a third-generation cephalosporin. C. hominis and other HACEK organisms also exhibit in vitro susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and <b>aztreonam.</b> C. hominis is often resistant to erythromycin.

5000|$|Sykes {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1997. His {{nominations}} reads [...] Richard Sykes is distinguished {{both as an}} experimental scientist and as {{a major force in}} the British pharmaceutical industry. He has, in his own right, made important experimental contributions to microbiology, of which the best known are his work on B-lactamases, and the discovery of the first monocyclic B-lactam antibiotic, <b>aztreonam.</b> The latter was not an accidental finding or simply the outcome of routine screening. Sykes was personally responsible for the development of imaginative new micro-screens of much greater sensitivity than those in use in the antibiotic industry at the time, and these ultra-sensitive screens enabled him to detect compounds present in trace amounts that were not detectable by standard methods. <b>Aztreonam</b> proved to be a major advance in the treatment of gram-negative infections. In 1986 Sykes rejoined Glaxo where he is now Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive of Glaxo Holdings plc. His influence within Glaxo and the pharmaceutical industry generally has been marked by a firm conviction of the overriding importance of good fundamental science, and this has found expression not only in the massive development of Glaxo R and D, but also in the vigorous interaction of the company with the university sector in the United Kingdom. He also makes a significant positive contribution to national science policy. The case for the election of Richard Sykes as a general candidate is very strong.|$|E
