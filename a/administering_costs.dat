Ray Boshara warns that [...] "this high cost may have a sobering effect on the expansion of IDAs". However, a proper cost-benefit analysis will require further research to see whether the benefits of IDAs exceed its costs or if other programs aimed at poverty alleviation deliver more benefits per unit of cost than IDAs.

As part of a program aimed at identifying protective antigens of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, a random pEX library was constructed and screened with antisera from hyperimmunised pigs. One clone (pSD 9), identified by Dr S. P. Djordjevic, contained a 0. 8 kb M. hyopneumoniae DNA fragment which encodes an immunoreactive antigen of that pathogen.

South Africa {{currently}} {{experiences the}} double jeopardy problem of {{catching up to}} global economic competitiveness whilst {{at the same time}} feeling the pressures of sustainability management spearheaded by a global agenda. Global sustainability is defined as growth that is shared without depleting natural resources or damaging the environment. Academic disciplines are challenged to make a contribution and economics as such should contribute by providing the lead and lag indicators for the planning and measurement of scarce resources usuage. This integrative view includes economic sub-disciplines, such as logistics. This integrative view is an acknowledged part of the economics discipline, except that the macro-economic context of some sub-disciplines, such as logistics, often receives less attention during the course of academic activities. The distribution of resources and outputs in the economy is a logistics controlled cross-cutting factor, but suffers from a lack of macro-economic perspective, and lead and lag orientated measurement. This state of the affairs is a historic backlog of logistics and its specific position within economics. During the primary economic era the world began to configure networks and markets, which became more pronounced and settled with the dawn and settling of the industrial era. Logistics then was a “given” and did not receive much thought even as industrial, market economies developed. Transport was regarded as an <b>administered</b> <b>cost,</b> i. e. inefficiencies in logistics systems were evenly distributed between competitors, not giving any specific entity an advantage. With the advent of global competition and the diminishing returns on other cost saving measures, companies began to collaborate and integrate logistics functions within value chains, but the administered part of transport costs failed to receive the attention it required. In this way, global competitors did begin to experience disadvantages on a national level as whole economies suffered from inefficiencies in logistics and specifically transport systems...|$|R

ABSTRACT Introduction Nosocomial infections which occur after 72 {{hours in}} hospitalised {{neonates}} cause {{morbidity and mortality}} particularly in very low birth weight neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Prolonged hospitalisation and use of sophisticated, expensive antibiotics lead to spiraling costs. Prevention of nosocomial infections are of the essence to contain expenditure and prevent life-threatening complications in vulnerable neonates. A prospective, descriptive study was undertaken to determine the cost of antibiotics used in the neonatal unit at Kalafong Hospital for nosocomial infections. Patients and Methods Neonates with nosocomial infections admitted consecutively to the neonatal unit were studied prospectively by documenting the birth weight, site of infection, pathogen, outcome, admission to the NICU and antibiotics <b>administered.</b> The <b>cost</b> related to antibiotic use was determined for each antibiotic, for individual neonates (expressed as the mean and standard deviation) and for {{the group as a}} whole.

Of the 1131 patients discharged, 938 (82. 94 %) patients received one or more IDs/IVFs. The mean number of drugs, IDs and IVFs prescribed were 8. 75, 4. 72 and 1. 42. Median cost of drugs and IDs/IVFs per prescription were 8. 26 US$ and 5. 12 US$ respectively. IDs/IVFs accounted for 81. 37 % of total drug cost.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{eradicate}} an infecting organism, {{it is necessary}} to achieve or maintain concentrations of an antibiotic in vivo that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the organism. Duration of exposure, or time above MIC, was recognized as being important for β-lactam antibiotics more than 60 years ago. Continuous infusion regimens are associated with higher clinical response rates, improvement in surrogate markers of outcome, and lower cost of therapy compared with intermittent infusion regimens, because the MIC can be exceeded for an entire dosing interval. However, for carbapenem antibiotics, it appears that the MIC must only be exceeded for 40 % of the dosing interval for bactericidal activity in vivo. Therefore, a promising strategy to optimize carbapenem use is to administer the same dose at the same frequency of administration but to extend the infusion time. Extended infusion regimens take full advantage of a drug’s exposure potential within the context of in vivo potency without altering the dose or dosing schedule and with no increase in toxicity or <b>cost.</b> <b>Administering</b> higher doses by extended infusion allows one to manage organisms with high MICs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose was}} to assess {{functional}} (balance L-L and A-P displacement, sit-to-stand test (SST) and Tinetti scale - balance and gait) and neurophysiological aspects (patellar and Achilles reflex and strength) relating these responses to the BODE Index. INTRODUCTION: The neurophysiological alterations found in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are associated with the severity of the disease. There is also involvement of peripheral muscle which, in combination with neurophysiological impairment, may further compromise the functional activity of these patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. Twenty-two patients with moderate to very severe COPD (> 60 years) and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers served as the control group (CG). The subjects performed spirometry and several measures of static and dynamic balance, monosynaptic reflexes, peripheral muscle strength, SST and the 6 -minute walk test. RESULTS: The individuals with COPD had a reduced reflex response, 36. 77 ± 3. 23 (p< 0. 05) and 43. 54 ± 6. 60 (p< 0. 05), achieved a lower number repetitions on the SST 19. 27 ± 3. 88 (p< 0. 05), exhibited lesser peripheral muscle strength on the femoral quadriceps muscle, 24. 98 ± 6. 88 (p< 0. 05) and exhibited deficits in functional balance and gait on the Tinetti scale, 26. 86 ± 1. 69 (p< 0. 05), compared with the CG. The BODE Index demonstrated correlations with balance assessment (determined by the Tinetti scale), r = 0. 59 (p< 0. 05) and the sit-to-stand test, r = 0. 78 (p< 0. 05).

A shift from lower to middle education and a one-point increase in CDS were associated with an increase of € 1678 (95 % CI 250 – 3369) and € 482 (95 % CI 316 – 654), respectively. Total mean direct costs did not differ significantly between sexes. Ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus were associated with excess costs of € 711 and € 290, both being not significant. Altogether 55 % of the respondents accounted for 90 % of total direct costs. ConclusionsAdvanced elderly used a wide range of health services. Our study still underestimates the true costs to society. Further research should focus on economic evaluation of new health-care programs for this increasingly important age group...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{consumer and}} producer {{costs and benefits}} of a modeled price support program for sugar superimposed on the 1974 - 1981 period, which was essentially free of effective price support programs and characterized by extreme variations in the U. S. price of domestic sugar. The study differs from previous studies {{in the sense that it}} models a with- and without-price support scenario. The modeled price support program is based on U. S. costs of production of raw cane sugar in 1981 and is imposed with appropriate deflation on the years 1974 - 1980 to permit comparison with the actual scenario without price supports. Research results indicate that an adequate price support program to maintain economic viability of the U. S. sugar industry during the 1974 - 1981 period would have cost consumers an additional $ 4. 77 per capita annually for sugar. This compares to an annual average loss of $ 4. 7 billion, or $ 21 per capita annually, during the research period if the U. S. sugar industry had become demised, assuming no alternative employment of production factors. The cost to the Hawaii economy would have been comparatively much more severe, amounting to $ 836 million annually in aggregate and $ 880 per capita. The program could be <b>administered</b> at no <b>cost</b> to the government through the imposition of import quotas. Per capita reduction in consumers' surplus would have averaged $ 1. 76 annually based on the duty rate of $ 0. 01875 per pound and $ 6. 08 based on the 20 percent ad valorem rate in effect in 1981. The study is expected to provide valuable insight to policymakers for future sugar legislation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The lower {{sales price}} of generic {{lamivudine}} has caused healthcare administrators to consider abolishing fixed-dose antiretroviral combinations (FDCs) that contain lamivudine and emtricitabine. The {{alternative is to}} administer the individual components of the FDCs separately, thus incorporating the new generic lamivudine medication. Methods: The Balearic Islands Health Service ordered the discontinuation of the treatment with FDCs in July 2010, but FDCs were reintroduced in August 2010. At that point, an independent, retrospective cost analysis was performed by Son Ll 0 tzer Hospital. A total of 75 patients who were treated from July to August 2010 underwent replacement of their FDC treatment with the individual components. Additionally, 150 patients who continued using FDCs were randomly selected. For both patient groups, the antiretroviral therapy that was <b>administered</b> and the <b>costs</b> associated with management of adverse events were recorded. The study period used for the cost calculations was {{the average number of}} days that patients used separate components of FDCs (120 days). An alternative analysis was performed to consider the costs of the extra follow-up visit (consultation and clinical tests) that was required for patients who changed their antiretroviral therapy. Results: Considering antiretroviral therapies and adverse events, the administration of the separate components increased the total daily cost by 0. 72 8 ̆ 0 per patient compared to treatment with FDCs. When the cost of an extra follow-up visit was considered, the daily cost increased by 3. 61 8 ̆ 0 per patient. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the discontinuation of FDC treatment and the replacement with the adminitration of separate antiretroviral agents could lead to an increase in healthcare costs due to the higher rate of adverse events that was observed with the discontinuation of FDCs...|$|R
40|$|Ethno-veterinary and herbal {{practices}} {{have been in}} use for centuries, resulting in transfer of knowledge to the common people of the society including the farming sector. The main advantages lie in the facts that they are accessible, easy to prepare and <b>administer,</b> with little <b>cost</b> involved. The Atharva-Veda mentions turmeric and yellow birds into which jaundice is charmed to enter, leaving the human patient. From such beginnings, man being guided by the instincts of the lower animals and the intuition of the best among his own species, has evolved the present complex system of the healing science {{in the service of}} health and life that finds its appropriateness in the context of cattle farming too. Even though the modern developments in therapeutic field brought about a rapid decline in traditional medicine, the plant-based remedies are still having a crucial role as potential source of therapeutic aids in health systems all over the world for both humans and animals. Nowadays immune-based therapies are gaining more importance than monovalent approaches which are having limited benefits. As far as the cattle industry is concerned, herbal plants are used as health promoters {{and at the same time}} for the treatment of diseases. Herbs are used variously for infections as anthelmintic and acaricidals and have got implications in surgical and gynaecological interventions as well as in bovine mastitis. Apart from the aforesaid uses, an array of herbal plants have been reported which are having immunomodulatory effects like modulation of cytokine secretion, histamine release, immunoglobulin secretion, class switching, cellular co receptor expression, lymphocyte expression, phagocytosis, and so on. The present review deals with wide variety of such plants responsible for safeguarding cattle health from every aspect...|$|R
