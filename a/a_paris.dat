5|$|As he is {{affected}} less by the distortions, Data is sent down alone and disables the remaining security measures before entering Manheim's laboratory. He finds {{a column of}} energy emanating from a dimensional matrix, {{the source of the}} time distortions. Data, though briefly affected by the time distortions, is able to add anti-matter to the matrix, causing the matrix to stabilize and halt the time distortions. Dr. Manheim fully recovers, and he and Jenice thank Picard and the crew for their help. Picard and Jenice use the holodeck to recreate one more encounter at <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> café, before she returns with her husband to the planet.|$|E

She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E

5|$|Hotel Chevalier is an American-French {{short film}} written and {{directed}} by Wes Anderson and released in 2007. Starring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman as former lovers who reunite in <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a prologue to Anderson's 2007 feature The Darjeeling Limited. It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the Venice Film Festival première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at Apple Stores in four U.S. cities.|$|E
5|$|Monteux {{continued}} {{to play in the}} Concerts Colonne through {{the first decade of the}} century. In 1910 Colonne died and was succeeded as principal conductor by Gabriel Pierné. As well as leading the violas, Monteux was assistant conductor, taking charge of early rehearsals and acting as chorus master for choral works. In 1910 the orchestra was engaged to play for <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> season given by Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company, the Ballets Russes. Monteux played under Pierné in the world premiere of Stravinsky's The Firebird. In 1911 Diaghilev engaged Nikolai Tcherepnin to conduct the premiere of Stravinsky's Petrushka. Monteux conducted the preliminary rehearsals before Tcherepnin arrived; Stravinsky was so impressed that he insisted that Monteux conduct the premiere.|$|E

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In August 1910, Lenin {{attended}} the Eighth Congress of the Second International – an international meeting of socialists – in Copenhagen as the RSDLP's representative, following {{this with a}} holiday in Stockholm with his mother. With his wife and sisters he then moved to France, settling first in Bombon and then Paris. Here, he became a close friend to the French Bolshevik Inessa Armand; some biographers suggest that they had an extra-marital affair from 1910 to 1912. Meanwhile, at <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> meeting in June 1911, the RSDLP Central Committee decided to move their focus of operations back to Russia, ordering {{the closure of the}} Bolshevik Centre and its newspaper, Proletari. Seeking to rebuild his influence in the party, Lenin arranged for a party conference to be held in Prague in January 1912, and although 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, he was heavily criticised for his factionalist tendencies and failed to boost his status within the party.|$|E

5|$|Lenin {{moved with}} his wife and sisters to Bombon in Seine-et-Marne, {{although}} 5 weeks later moved back to Paris, settling in the Rue Marie-Rose. In France, Lenin became friends with the French Bolshevik Inessa Armand; they remained close from 1910 through to 1912, and some biographers believe that they had an extra-marital affair, although this remains unproven. He also set up a RSDLP school at Longjumeau where he lectured Russian recruits on a variety of topics in May 1911. Meanwhile, at <b>a</b> <b>Paris</b> meeting in June 1911 the RSDLP Central Committee decided to draw the focus of operations from Paris and back to Russia; they ordered the closure of the Bolshevik Centre and its newspaper, Proletari. Seeking to rebuild his influence in the party, Lenin arranged for a party conference to be held in Prague in January 1912, aided by his supporter Sergo Ordzhonikidze. 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, but they heavily criticised Lenin for his factionalism, and lost much personal authority.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy <b>A.</b> <b>Paris,</b> then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E
