500|$|While {{playing in}} a sold-out {{friendly}} match against Canada at BMO Field in Toronto, Ontario in June 2013, Leroux was booed by Canadian fans throughout the match. After scoring during stoppage time to bring the score to 3–0 {{in favor of the}} U.S., Leroux celebrated her goal by hushing the crowd and pointing to the U.S. emblem on her jersey which further inflamed many fans in the crowd. After the game, she stated via Twitter, [...] "When you chant racial slurs, taunt me and talk <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> don't be mad when I shush you and show pride in what I represent. #america." [...] The U.S. Soccer Federation announced that Leroux had [...] "endured abuse both verbally and in social media" [...] since switching to the U.S. national soccer team in 2008; however, Leroux later clarified that no such incidents took place at BMO Field. [...] "My tweet from this morning wasn't in response to anything from yesterday's match at BMO Field. In fact, the atmosphere at the stadium was a positive step forward for women's soccer. Unfortunately, the type of abuse I have received in the past and via social media for my decision to play for the United States is a step backwards. That is what prompted my response {{in the heat of the}} moment." ...|$|E

For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>family,</b> the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the week}} before the 2007 Twenty20 world cup match in South Africa, Shoaib Akhtar was rumoured to have hit Asif with a bat, leaving a bruise on his left thigh. According to sources, the two were {{involved}} in a dressing room spat which resulted in Asif being struck by a bat on his left thigh. Sources said the fight between the two started after Asif and Shahid Afridi disagreed with Shoaib that he shared the same stature as Imran Khan in Pakistan cricket and even ridiculed him for making such a comparison. The injury was not thought to be anything more serious than a bruise but a team investigation into the matter was pending. After the initial inquiry, it would found that Shoaib was at fault and he was subsequently recalled from the Twenty20 World Cup squad and was sent home. He was also banned for 5 matches by the PCB and a lifetime ban may also seem imminent. Akhtar later claimed that Afridi was responsible for the fight, saying [...] "He made some ill remarks <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> And I could not tolerate them" [...] Afridi however, denied these allegations adding that Asif would have suffered more injuries but for his intervention.

40|$|As an Aboriginal author, {{my thesis}} is {{grounded}} in an Indigenist paradigm; a paradigm that places Indigenous experiences {{at the center of}} inquiry and whose goals are to “serve and inform the Indigenous struggle for self-determination” (Rigney, 1997, p. 119). Hence, this thesis is an auto/ethnographic journey based on my lived experiences. Apart from my memories I draw on family documents as well as other printed source material, such as the diaries of my Grandfather and departmental files. In the era when I was growing up, the cliché of; “Children should be seen and not heard” was popular. Not only that, my mother often told us that we children were never to tell anyone our business or talk about our personal life. Therefore, I never spoke freely <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>family’s</b> life, <b>my</b> growing up years and how I was ashamed of being an Aboriginal when I was younger. While was raising my four grandchildren, I started thinking <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>family’s</b> history and how my children and grandchildren knew little of our history. Through reading articles and books by Indigenous authors I came to better understand our history and have come to appreciate that our history must be documented by Indigenous peoples. Although many stories have been written about Indigenous peoples by non-Indigenous writers, these writings tend to perpetuate misconceptions and stereotypes about the First Peoples of Australia. An Indigenist approach seeks to debunk these misconceptions and place the Indigenous experience {{at the center of the}} inquiry. Reflecting on the stories written by Indigenous authors, I decided to follow their example and tell <b>my</b> <b>family’s</b> story as best I could, despite my mother’s injunction never to tell anyone “our business”. Therefore, Annie’s Mob is the story of my own life as well as the story of <b>my</b> <b>family,</b> given that <b>my</b> life has unfolded within the context of <b>my</b> <b>family</b> and the historical times in which we lived. I hope my story will encourage other women and men to document their history and leave their stories as a legacy for the future...|$|R

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E

When looking for a model that would be consistent with the look and concept I envisioned – witty, comedic, populated with eccentric characters, with carefully and specifically detailed visuals – the films of Wes Anderson, particularly The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), came to mind immediately. Each of his stories is very deliberately structured with a playful sense of chaotic charm, which is the tone I hope to capture in my storytelling. And, not coincidentally, I noticed that when people talk <b>about</b> <b>my</b> extended <b>family,</b> they refer to us as ‘the real-life Tenenbaums,’ meaning that each person is unapologetically who they are with larger-than-life personalities. Growing up hearing wild tales of life with my grandparents in their New York apartment from my mother and extended family, I was inspired to create my own film version of these stories. In choosing to emulate this director’s style within my film, I intend to capture the light-hearted spirit of <b>my</b> <b>family</b> {{in a manner that is}} easily recognizable and which is in keeping with its character...|$|R
