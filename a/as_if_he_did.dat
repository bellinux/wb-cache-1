25|$|There {{are other}} {{problems}} with Shoshenq being {{the same as}} the biblical Shishak: Shoshenq's Karnak list does not include Jerusalem—his biggest prize according to the Bible. His list focuses on places either north or south of Judah, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not raid the center. The fundamental problem facing historians is establishing the aims of the two accounts and linking up the information in them.|$|E
25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, Powell said, as if he was a pariah though Macleod 'knew what I said was not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E
2500|$|Methodist biblical {{commentator}} Joseph Benson {{writes that}} [...] "Repentance, properly speaking, implies grief of heart, {{and a change}} of counsels. Understood in which sense, it can {{have no place in}} God. But it is often ascribed to him in the Scriptures when he alters his method of dealing with persons, and treats them <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> indeed repent of the kindness he had shown them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Natural justice {{allows a}} person to claim the right to {{adequate}} notification of the date, time, place of the hearing as well as detailed notification of the case to be met. This information allows the person adequate time to effectively prepare {{his or her own}} case and to answer the case against him or her. In Cooper v. Wandsworth, Chief Justice William Erle {{went so far as to}} state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not matter. As Lord Mustill famously held in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody (1993): [...] "Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} grew increasingly decadent. [...] His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women. [...] The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. [...] Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not care. [...] It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "There must be many people who want to hurt me. [...] However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng , and you will at least be like Empress Shen [...] [...] Do not worry. [...] Let us drink and be merry." [...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began to hear about it. [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. [...] When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late.|$|E

Kittridge greets his old comrade (from Solo's prior mission) and makes the mistake of saying that his instincts are telling him {{that there is something}} wrong with Solo, forcing the double to kill him. Solo tells Kuryakin that Kittridge was a THRUSH assassin. Solo's latest girlfriend, stewardess Sandy Wister (Sharon Farrell), is miffed that <b>he</b> acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know her, but makes no fuss.|$|R

Kara asks Mon-El about their kiss, but he ignores it, acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not remember it, so she drops the subject.

50|$|At the 1964 Summer Olympics he {{finished}} second, after another Soviet weightlifter, Leonid Zhabotinsky. Vlasov was breaking world records at the 1964 Olympics and was aiming {{to retire from}} competitions with the gold medal. He was bitterly disappointed by the tactical tricks played by Zhabotinsky during the final clean-and-jerk event, which he considered dishonest - Zhabotinsky intentionally failed his second attempt, and talked and behaved <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not compete for the gold medal. In reality Zhabotinsky merely positioned himself behind Vlasov, who started the event first, and in his last attempt would order (and lift) any weight required to win the overall competition.|$|R
