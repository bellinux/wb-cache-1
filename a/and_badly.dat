5|$|As the German ships {{approached}} Glorious, Acasta, {{which had}} been trying to maintain the smokescreen, broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaged her. Acasta also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch guns on Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E
5|$|Carte's real {{ambition}} was {{to develop}} an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Count Otto von Doom: Doom is {{the ruler}} of Latveria, known as Otto the Handsome due to his perfect {{physique}} and appearance. He captures the Fantastick Four in order to force Reed's compliance in creating war machines, poisons, and various other inventions. Von Doom is later struck <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> burned by Thor's lightning, although he survives.|$|E
50|$|The 1995-96 Dallas Stars {{season was}} the third National Hockey League season in Dallas, Texas (and 29th as a franchise), which would start off <b>badly</b> <b>and</b> finish <b>badly,</b> with a {{division}} worst 26-42-14.|$|R

5|$|Following the battalion's move up {{the railway}} line in July, Blackader was {{transferred}} to a new post at Balmoral; {{as well as the}} railway station, he was made responsible for a civilian concentration camp outside the town. These camps were frequently crowded, unhealthy, <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> supplied; few reports have survived on the Balmoral camp, however, and {{it is not clear how}} efficient or otherwise Blackader's administration was.|$|E
5|$|In 1585, Queen Elizabeth I of England {{took the}} United Provinces of the Netherlands under her {{protection}} and signed the Treaty of Nonsuch with the States-General. England dispatched 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry soldiers to the Low Countries, and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was proclaimed Governor-General of the Netherlands. Commanding untrained <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> paid levies, Leicester {{was unable to}} prevent the Army of Flanders under Alessandro Farnese, from seizing the towns of Grave, Venlo and Neuss, though he managed to take Axel.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{the display}} was totally renovated. The {{destroyed}} limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of Derbyshire limestone, many weighing over , rebuilt {{according to a}} small model made from {{the same number of}} polystyrene blocks. Fibreglass replacements were created for the missing sculptures, <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the bodies with iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.|$|E

5|$|Leipzig {{participated in}} {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War. In {{the first year}} of World War II, she performed escort duties for warships in the Baltic and North seas. While on one of these operations in December 1939, the ship was torpedoed by a British submarine <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. Repairs were completed by late 1940, when she returned to service as a training ship. She provided gunfire support to the advancing Wehrmacht troops as they invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{designer}} and production staff {{were satisfied with}} the feudal Japan-inspired Klingon costumes Fletcher made for The Motion Picture, but they had to make new versions; of 12original costumes, half had been destroyed during publicity tours. The remaining six were loaned out for an episode of Mork & Mindy <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaged; Fletcher spent three months salvaging what remained. Additions to established clothing included an officer's vest for Kruge, and jewelry.|$|E
5|$|This {{fortress}} {{is placed}} at Ponta OÅ¡tro, {{at the very}} end of Prevlaka peninsula. It was built in the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor at the time of the Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time. Today, the fortress is out of use <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaged by various destructions during history.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This is a {{continuation}} of our earlier paper [PT 3]. We consider here operator-valued functions (or infinite matrix functions) on the unit circle T and study the problem of approximation by bounded analytic operator functions. We discuss thematic and canonical factorizations of operator functions <b>and</b> study <b>badly</b> approximable <b>and</b> very <b>badly</b> approximable operator functions. We obtain algebraic and geometric characterizations of <b>badly</b> approximable <b>and</b> very <b>badly</b> approximable operator functions. Note that there is an important difference between the case of finite matrix functions and the case of operator functions. Our criteria for a function to be very badly approximable in the case of finite matrix functions also guarantee that the zero function is the only superoptimal approximant. However in the case of operator functions this is not true. 1...|$|R
5|$|All four {{ships of}} the class entered service {{in time to see}} action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the {{commander}} of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed at the island of Lissa. There, the Austrian fleet under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff attacked the Italians. The four Regina Maria Pias all took part in the ensuing Battle of Lissa. Regina Maria Pia had been set on fire <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> burned in the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard San Martino and Castelfidardo, but neither were seriously damaged. Ancona emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{is known}} for {{commanding}} the 24th Infantry Division at {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War. Dean led the division for several weeks in unsuccessful delaying battles against the North Koreans, before he led his division in making a last stand at Taejon. During the confused retreat from that city, Dean was separated from his soldiers <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> injured, and was eventually captured by the North Koreans. He remained in North Korean custody near P'yongyang {{for the remainder of the}} war. After the end of the conflict, Dean returned to the United States to a hero's welcome. He retired from the Army soon after and lived a quiet life until his death.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In {{a desperate attempt to}} slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the town}} closed the bridge {{as it was}} deemed unsafe <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> deteriorated. It was {{estimated}} that $72,000 {{would be needed to}} relocate the bridge. In February 1999, an eight-member committee was tasked with planning a municipal park on the site. First Selectman Paul Brycki, hoped that the pending nomination to the National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge. Prior to February 1999, the historic bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot near the town hall and a replacement bridge was installed. The bridge was also on the state of Connecticut's historic register list.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|Midilli {{was active}} in laying minefields off the Russian coast, bombarding Russian ports and {{installations}} and, because of a shortage of Ottoman merchant ships, transporting troops and supplies to the Black Sea ports supplying Ottoman troops fighting in the Caucasus Campaign. She was lightly damaged several times by Russian ships, but the most serious damage was inflicted by a mine in 1915, which kept her out of service for half of a year. The ship was mined and sunk in January 1918 during the Battle of Imbros in which Yavuz Sultan Selim was also mined <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. The majority of her crew {{were killed in the}} sinking.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off HokkaidÅ when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men <b>and</b> <b>badly</b> damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E
