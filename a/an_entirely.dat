5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E

Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E
