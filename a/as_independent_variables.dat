This two-port network is particularly suited to BJTs as it lends itself easily to the analysis of circuit behaviour, and may be used to develop further accurate models.

2500|$|Oligopoly is {{a market}} form in which a market or {{industry}} is dominated by {{a small number of}} sellers. The oldest model was the duopoly of Cournot (1838). It was criticized by Harold Hotelling for its instability, by Joseph Bertrand for lacking equilibrium for prices <b>as</b> <b>independent</b> <b>variables.</b> Hotelling built a model of market located over a line with two sellers in each extreme of the line, in this case maximizing profit for both sellers leads to a stable equilibrium. From this model also follows that if a seller is to choose the location of his store so as to maximize his profit, he will place his store the closest to his competitor: [...] "the sharper competition with his rival is offset by the greater number of buyers he has an advantage". He also argues that clustering of stores is wasteful {{from the point of view}} of transportation costs and that public interest would dictate more spatial dispersion.|$|E

60|$|When the reconstructed squares were wrong, {{they had}} none the less a natural appearance. This was {{especially}} seen, {{and on a}} large scale, in {{the result of the}} method by chequer-work, in which the lineations of an entire print were constructed by guess. Being so familiar with the run of these ridges in finger prints, I can speak with confidence on this. My assumption is, that any one of these reconstructions represents lineations that might have occurred in Nature, in association with the conditions outside the square, just as well as the lineations of the actual finger print. The courses of the ridges in each square are subject to uncertainties, due to petty local incidents, to which the conditions outside the square give no sure indication. They appear to be in great part determined by the particular disposition of each {{one or more of the}} half hundred or so sweat-glands which the square contains. The ridges rarely run in evenly flowing lines, but may be compared to footways across a broken country, which, while they follow a general direction, are continually deflected by such trifles as a tuft of grass, a stone, or a puddle. Even if the number of ridges emerging from a six-ridge-interval square equals the number of those which enter, it does not follow that they run across in parallel lines, for there is plenty of room for any one of the ridges to end, and another to bifurcate. It is impossible, therefore, to know beforehand in which, if in any of the ridges, these peculiarities will be found. When the number of entering and issuing ridges is unequal, the difficulty is increased. There may, moreover, be islands or enclosures in any particular part of the square. It therefore seems right to look upon the squares <b>as</b> <b>independent</b> <b>variables,</b> in the sense that when the surrounding conditions are alone taken into account, the ridges within their limits may either run in the observed way or in a different way, the chance of these two contrasted events being taken (for safety's sake) as approximately equal.|$|E
