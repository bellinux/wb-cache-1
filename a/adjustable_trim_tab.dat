2500|$|The A1 is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. The wing has straight edges, with sweep only on {{the leading}} edge, and squared tips. [...] It is a single piece structure of light alloy construction, with Frise type mass balanced ailerons which are fabric covered aft of the spar; a ground <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is fitted on the port side. [...] There are no flaps. [...] The empennage is also straight tapered and of similar construction to the wing, though the rudder is fabric covered. There is a small dorsal fin. [...] All rear control surfaces are horn balanced; the tailplane's incidence can be adjusted {{on the ground and}} the starboard elevator has a ground <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torque from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.|$|E
2500|$|The Meteor has a pod-and-boom style {{fuselage}}, with a long, single-piece canopy {{above the}} upper fuselage line, {{forward of the}} wing, under which the pilot sits in a reclined position. [...] The under-wing, retractable monowheel undercarriage is assisted by a short, retractable, forward skid. [...] Retraction is manual; there is a wheel brake. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage has a circular cross-section. [...] There is a long, shallow fillet or sub fin between fuselage and fin, both straight edged, and both rudder and fin extend well below the lower fuselage line to form a tail bumper. The rudder is horn balanced. Later revisions slightly increased rudder area. The high aspect ratio, straight tapered tailplane is mounted above the fuselage on the fillet forward of the fin's leading edge. [...] The elevators are also aerodynamically balanced and originally carried a ground <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> later removed.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{reducing}} pilot workload, proper trim {{also increases}} fuel efficiency by reducing drag. For example, propeller aircraft {{have a tendency}} to yaw when operating at high power, for instance when climbing; this increases parasitic drag because the craft is not flying straight into the apparent wind. In such circumstances, the use of an <b>adjustable</b> rudder <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> can reduce yaw.|$|R
50|$|Ahead of the car's forward {{bulkhead}} the brake cylinders, fire extinguisher system, battery and radiator were {{carried on a}} tray-like extension to the cockpit floor pan, constructed in lighter 20 gauge aluminium sheet. Herd did consider using side-mounted radiators, but these were too complex to design and build in the time available. The car's fibreglass nose bodywork enclosing the radiator was relatively square, with a near-rectangular opening for the radiator intake. On {{either side of the}} radiator opening Herd placed small wings to generate downforce, moulded with the radiator cowl as a single unit. These wings were fixed in position, braced with a steel tube that spanned their full width, and carried <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> along their trailing edges. At the rear of the car a large, single-plane, adjustable wing was mounted atop the gearbox, between the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was a monocoque wooden structure, flat sided {{but with}} a rounded top running from above the cabin to the tail. The cabin seated four in two rows; the two forward seats had dual control and behind them was a carrier for food and a folding table on the starboard side. There was also a refrigerator. Behind the rear seats was a panel with sliding door access to a starboard side toilet The corresponding port-side space was a baggage compartment accessible only from outside. Entry to the cabin was via an over-wing port side door. The tail unit was a cantilever structure with the tailplane {{an integral part of}} the upper fuselage, carrying endplate fins with straight swept leading edges above the tailplane and rounded below. The fixed surfaces were plywood skinned, but rudders and the elevator were fabric covered. These control surfaces had in-flight <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R

50|$|The NG4 is a {{conventionally}} {{laid out}} low wing monoplane, built from riveted aluminium apart from composite wing tips and engine cowling. It has straight-tapered wings with barely swept leading edges. The UL version has upturned tips and the LSA short chord winglets. Four position split flaps fill the trailing edges inboard of the ailerons. The port aileron has a flight <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> The tail surfaces are also straight-tapered; fin and rudder are swept. Rear control surfaces, like the ailerons are unbalanced; {{there is a}} large, centrally placed elevator trim tab.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} from Kevlar-reinforced fibreglass with steel tube reinforcement {{in the cockpit}} area. The seating is for pilot and passenger in side-by-side configuration, sharing a centre-mounted control stick. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, with curved main gear legs made from fibreglass and a nosewheel mounted on steel tubes with rubber puck shock absorbing. There is also a shock-absorbing tail skid mounted under the fin. While the fin is fibreglass the horizontal stabilizer, elevator and <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> mounted as a T-tail are all aluminum.|$|E
50|$|The T-840 was {{powered by}} two 420 hp (313 kW) Wright R-975 9-cylinder radial engines, mounted well forward {{and above the}} wing leading edge and {{enclosed}} in wide chord NACA cowlings. Behind them, fairings extended almost to {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Between the fuselage and engines the wings had steel tube frames and were aluminium covered. Outboard of the engines the wings had two wooden spars, spruce and plywood ribs and were fabric covered. A pair of faired, parallel struts on each side ran {{from the bottom of the}} fuselage to the wing close to the engine. The slotted flaps had stressed aluminium skins and the slats were also metal, moving on rollers, but the ailerons had fabric covering over metal frames. The tail surfaces were conventional, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage; like the fin, the tailplane was a plywood covered wooden structure. The control surfaces had metal structures and fabric covering; both elevators and rudder carried flight <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} flew for {{the first}} time on 15 May 1959 but was lost in a fatal crash during single engine tests on 2 August 1959. [...] Development work continued on a second aircraft which first flew in 1960 and a third followed in 1962. The fourth aircraft, now renamed the Simmering-Graz-Pauker SGP.222 was intended as a production prototype and demonstrator and appeared at the 1964 Hamburg show, though it turned out to be the last of the line. [...] It incorporated several changes in response to the lengthy development trials. The wing leading edges had breaker strips added and there were new fillets in this edge at the root and on the outboard side of the engine cowlings. [...] The ailerons were mass balanced and fitted with ground <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> and the upper hinge gaps sealed with fabric. The most obvious external changes were to the empennage where the horizontal tail now had positive dihedral and the previously rounded vertical tail had been enlarged and given severe straight taper, assisted by a ventral fin to improve low speed handling. Both elevators and the rudder had <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fin was {{integral}} with the fuselage and also skinned with plywood. The tailplane was built up with wooden ribs and plywood leading edges stiffened with internal diagonal braces. The prototype was built with an <b>adjustable</b> tailplane for <b>trimming</b> {{but this was}} soon changed to a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> on the elevator.|$|R
50|$|The Cessna 152 is {{equipped}} with differential ailerons that move through 20 degrees upwards and 15 degrees downwards. It has single-slotted flaps which are electrically operated and deploy {{to a maximum of}} 30 degrees. The rudder can move 23 degrees to either side and is fitted with a ground-adjustable trim tab. The elevators move up through 25 degrees and down through 18 degrees. An <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is installed on the right elevator and is controlled by a small wheel {{in the center of the}} control console. The trim tab moves 10 degrees up and 20 degrees down relative to the elevator chordline.|$|E
50|$|The Viper is {{constructed}} mostly of metal, with aluminium skinning, using CNC machining. Composite materials {{are used for}} {{the tips of the}} flying surfaces, the fuselage upper decking, engine cowling and wheel fairings. The wings have constant chord and curved, slightly upswept tips; they are built around one main and one auxiliary spar. The short span ailerons move on piano-type hinges, with slotted flaps {{on the rest of the}} trailing edges. The low-mounted horizontal tail is also of constant chord apart from a cut-out for rudder movement; the starboard elevator carries a flight <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> Fin and rudder are straight-edged, but swept.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{a two-part}} monocoque structure, bolted together. The rear surfaces are tapered and straight edged; the elevator has a flight <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> Forward, the upper fuselage line merges into {{that of the}} cabin glazing over a baggage space behind the rear bench seat. The front seats have dual control. Cabin access is via a starboard side door. The Nibbio {{is powered by a}} 180 hp (134 kW) Lycoming O-360 air-cooled four cylinder horizontally opposed engine, fed fuel from one fuselage and two wing tanks. It has an electrically retractable tricycle undercarriage with hydraulic brakes and a steerable nosewheel. The main legs are wing mounted and retract inwards.|$|E
50|$|However, the investigation, {{released}} in August 2012, {{found that the}} probable cause of the crash were reused single-use locknuts in the left elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an attachment screw and allowed the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> to flutter. This flutter caused the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> link assembly to fail which led to loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> had been fixed in place. Had both <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> been operational, {{the loss of the}} left <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> alone may not have caused loss of control. When the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> failed, Leeward was exposed to 17Gs which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.|$|R
50|$|TrimTabs {{takes its}} name from the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> that lies deep within an ocean-going ship. The <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is a {{minuscule}} rudder that runs the length of the main rudder. To change the ship’s direction, one must first turn the <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> and then the main rudder follows. TrimTabs contends that just as the movement of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> determines the direction of a ship, changes in the <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> of liquidity theory are the key to understanding the stock market’s direction.|$|R

5000|$|The Akro was {{designed}} as a homebuilt aircraft for pilots who competed in aerobatic competitions. It was the first U.S. aircraft design to be guided by the Aresti Catalog of manoeuvres for such events. The structure absorbs high stresses, +12/-11g. The Akro is a cantilever mid wing monoplane with a wooden, two spar mahogany skinned wing built in one piece, its forward spar passing unbroken through the fuselage and the rear spar in two parts. The plain, statically balanced ailerons have steel spars with spruce ribs and trailing edges they are fabric covered and carry ground adjustable trim tabs. The tail unit is a fabric covered steel tube structure, wire braced and with swept, straight tapered surfaces. Like the ailerons, all the rear control surfaces are statically balanced.

50|$|Its square section fuselage, with rounded upper decking, is also plywood covered {{apart from}} a {{polyester}} engine cover. A nose mounted modified 30 kW (40 hp) Volkswagen engine drives a two blade propeller. The single seat cockpit, placed over the wing leading edge, is under a sideways opening, single piece canopy. There is a baggage space behind the seat, where the canopy line runs into that of the high rear decking. The empennage is conventional with ply covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces. The horizontal surfaces are placed close {{to the top of}} the fuselage, with the elevator hinge ahead of that for the rudder. The elevators have a cut out for rudder movement as the latter extends down to the keel. There is an in-flight <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> on the port elevator and a ground adjustable one the rudder. The Féré F.3 lands on a fixed, conventional undercarriage with rubber block shock absorbers on the cantilever main legs. The mainwheels are enclosed in fairings and have brakes; the leaf spring mounted tailwheel is steerable.|$|E
50|$|Trim tabs {{are small}} movable {{sections}} resembling scaled down ailerons located {{at or near}} the trailing edge of the aileron. On most propeller powered aircraft, the rotation of the propeller(s) induces a counteracting roll movement due to Newton's third law of motion, in that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. To relieve the pilot of having to provide continuous pressure on the stick in one direction (which causes fatigue) trim tabs are provided to adjust or trim out the pressure needed against any unwanted movement. The tab itself is deflected in relation to the aileron, causing the aileron to move in the opposite direction. Trim tabs come in two forms, adjustable and fixed. A fixed trim tab is manually bent to the required amount of deflection, while the <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> can be controlled from within the cockpit so that different power settings or flight attitudes can be compensated for. Some large aircraft from the 1950s (including the Canadair Argus) used free floating control surfaces that the pilot controlled only through the deflection of trim tabs, in which case additional tabs were also provided to fine-tune the control to provide straight and level flight.|$|E
40|$|The {{spacecraft}} in {{the next}} series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-Next) are Earth pointing and have 5 -year mission lifetimes. Because gyros can be depended on {{only for a few}} years of continuous use, they will be turned off during routine operations. This means attitude must, at times, be determined without benefit of gyros and, often, using only Earth sensor data. To minimize the interruption caused by dumping angular momentum, these spacecraft have been designed to reduce the environmental torque acting on them and incorporate an adjustable solar trim tab for fine adjustment. A new support requirement for GOES-Next is that of setting the solar trim tab. Optimizing its setting requires an estimate of the unbalanced torque on the spacecraft. These two requirements, determining attitude without gyros and estimating the external torque, are addressed by replacing or supplementing the gyro propagation with a dynamic one, that is, one that integrates the rigid body equations of motion. By processing quarter-orbit or longer batches, this approach takes advantage of roll-yaw coupling to observe attitude completely without Sun sensor data. Telemetered momentum wheel speeds are used as observations of the unbalanced external torques. GOES-Next provides a unique opportunity to study dynamic attitude propagation. The geosynchronous altitude and <b>adjustable</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> minimize the external torque and its uncertainty, making long-term dynamic propagation feasible. This paper presents the equations for dynamic propagation, an analysis of the environmental torques, and an estimate of the accuracies obtainable with the proposed method...|$|E

5000|$|The {{engineer}} Buckminster Fuller {{is often}} cited for his use of <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{as a metaphor for}} leadership and personal empowerment. In the February 1972 issue of Playboy, Fuller said: Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Mary - the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing {{at the edge of the}} rudder called a trim tab.It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you altogether. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go.So I said, call me <b>Trim</b> <b>Tab.</b> Buckminster Fuller ...|$|R
5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a <b>trim</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to trim an elevator to hold the nose down, the elevator's <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|R
