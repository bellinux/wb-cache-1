2500|$|Romania's {{history has}} been full of rebounds: the {{culturally}} productive epochs were those of stability, when the people proved quite an impressive resourcefulness in making up for less propitious periods {{and were able to}} rejoin the mainstream of European culture. This stands true for the years after the Phanariote-Ottoman period, {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century, when Romanians had a favourable historical context and Romania started to become westernized, mainly with French influences, which they pursued steadily and at a very fast pace. From the end of the 18th century, the sons of the upper classes started having their education in Paris, and French became (and was until the communist years) a genuine second language of culture for Romanians. The modeling role of France especially in the fields of political ideas, administration and law, as well as in literature was paralleled, from the mid-19th century down to World War I, by German culture as well, which also triggered constant relationships with the German world not only <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>level</b> but in daily life as well.

40|$|The author’s {{argument}} is that Europe must renounce Kant’s universalism and adopt political means in resolving its permanently conflictual situations. In that way it is to construct its new identity that stems neither from the divergent past of its members nor from their divergent perceptions of the future, but is being built in the politically active present. The European Union as a community sui generis is founded on a paradox. Namely, it does not grow from its familiar historical identity, but is growing into it by permanently resolving the conflictual situations {{of the state of}} nature by political means.

Once seen as {{a marginal}} component of corporate philanthropy, cross-sectoral partnerships have aroused considerable interest {{in recent years in}} business publications, non-profit management literature, as well as academic papers. Indeed, partnerships between corporations and non-profit arts organizations seem to represent for both sides an inevitable, if not vital, strategic tool to survive and thrive in the marketplace. However, despite increasingly successful or less successful examples of nationwide community-based collaborations between the corporate and non-profit sectors, cross-sector partnerships have rarely been addressed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> public policy level, {{and when it comes to}} the art sector, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> policy <b>level.</b> By reviewing and analyzing literature from the early 1990 s to the present, this study intends to better understand the value of such cross-organizational practices and its further implications on society.

50|$|Namibian Cultural Association is an {{association}} (Non Governmental Organization) formed under the French Law of Associations of 1901, {{commonly known as}} «Association de Loi 1901». It is {{an association}} for Namibians living in France and the nearby European countries. The idea of forming an association for Namibians was born on 21 March 2009 at the Namibian Independence celebrations in Lyon, France. There was first of all a need among Namibians in France and the nearby countries like Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, etc. to come together, know each other and share experiences. Namibians in the above-mentioned countries are generally few and are normally isolated, therefore the need of coming together and strengthening a Namibian network in Europe was primordial. There was also a need of collaborating with French nationals and the European countries nearby. The goal is to promote the exchange of cultural and humanistic values between the above-mentioned countries and the Namibians living in it. Namibia cultural Association believes that shared activities and exchanges are an unrivaled means of not only creating international understanding, but also better communication amongst Namibians in Europe. This will involve having gatherings and making friends, regulates social behavior and creates a feeling of belonging for Namibians. Namibia cultural Association also believes that it {{can play an important}} role in promoting international relations <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|Representations of the 'other' {{in media}} often exist only {{to further the}} {{narratives}} of the 'dominant' {{for the benefit of}} an assumedly-dominant audience, and are otherwise unseen or misrepresented. This results in the other being denied genuine reflections of themselves <b>at</b> <b>a</b> social and <b>cultural</b> <b>level</b> (Diaz as cited in Donahue, 2009). Through visual analysis and design, this research explores the nature of the term personhood - defined as character and qualities regarding who can be a ‘person’ - through media representations of both the human other and the fictional alien other. The alien within science fiction is visible as a reaction to our very human history of colonialism (Diaz, 2014) and in particular to the categorization of the human and non-human other. The resulting characterisation, relationships and narratives of the alien become limited by its adherence or lack thereof to the features of the dominant human. This manifests in how personhood is ascribed in media (according to gender performance, sexuality, race, physicality and other categories) to both aliens and their real-life reflection, the human other. Pilot culminates in an interactive intervention blending film, game and literature within a two-player character-driven narrative that discusses settler-colonialism, relationships and personhood through the lens of both the alien and the human other...|$|R

Within this framework, languages evolve through variation, competition and selection. Invention and learning are identified as variation mechanisms; learnability, transmission bottlenecks and stability are pressures for competition; and optimising for success is a good selection mechanism. Rather than studying the language development in individual users, this chapter illustrates how artificial multi-agent systems equipped with these principles can self-organise a compositional language from scratch. It is argued that this model offers a good alternative to many standard approaches in linguistics. ...|$|E

The present study adopts a qualitative evaluation methodology in order to explore what constitutes effective programme implementation, impact and outcomes. This approach is based on the assertion that the nature and context in which a programme is delivered can affect treatment quality and ultimately influence treatment success. Thus, understanding how programmes are delivered and received can help us to interpret findings from reconviction studies by providing an insight into how factors such as the institutional context in which programmes operate can have an impact on treatment success. The current study aims to enhance our understanding of the issues around the implementation and delivery of cognitive skills programmes in a prison context and to identify any non-reconviction treatment benefits. The research was undertaken in six male prisons and a total of 113 interviews were conducted with prisoners, programme tutors and other prison staff. A further five interviews were held with ex-prisoners on licence in the community. The report notes that many interviewees reported short-term benefits associated with programme participation. These included increased self-confidence, the development of interpersonal skills and improved prisoner behaviour. Furthermore, it is argued that the nature of prisoners? motivations for participating in cognitive skills training is a key factor when it comes to assessing the effectiveness of such interventions. From an institutional perspective, where {{there is a lack of}} support for programmes <b>at</b> <b>an</b> operational and/or <b>cultural</b> <b>level</b> this can affect programme delivery and have a negative impact on treatment efficacy...|$|R

I begin by developing a theoretical orientation to disgust and the disgusting woman, drawing from works by Winfried Menninghaus, Julia Kristeva, Judith Butler, and Theodor Adorno. Next, I use this theoretical framework to interpret three prominent texts of contemporary Austrian literature: Barbara Frischmuth’s “Otter,” Christoph Ransmayr’s Die letzte Welt, and Elfriede Jelinek’s Die Klavierspielerin. Ultimately, my analysis yields three compelling insights. First, through literary interpretation, disgust can be shown to operate <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>level</b> to exclude and oppress women. Second, literary texts can describe and reveal, in a way purely theoretical works cannot, the visceral, embodied effects of disgust on human subjects—and on women in particular.

40|$|The Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) {{reforms have}} been {{reported}} as the most significant reforms of its kind for over 30 years. Through the Children and Families Act 2014 the Government are seeking to affect cultural change; specifically {{the development of an}} aspirational and outcome based system for individuals with SEND, with the family at the centre (DfE and DoH, 2014). The Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) is responsible for the operational and strategic aspects related to SEND provision within the school and as such will be a key implementer of the reforms. The SEND Code of Practice came into effect on 1 st September 2014; therefore current research is limited. This paper forms part of a PhD research project which intends to develop research in this area through exploring and analysing the in-depth experience of the SENCO as a policy implementer during the first academic year post-reform. Through a semi-naturalist narrative inquiry approach, SENCOs participate in half-termly semi-structured interviews, to share the lived experience of the policy implementer; specifically how their role develops and emerges in response to, and through the narration of, new policy. However, policy enactment does not take place in isolation (Ball et al., 2012). Therefore interviews are situated within wider data gathering from experienced SENCOs, Local Authorities and the Department for Education through interviews, questionnaires and document analysis. This paper discusses the initial emerging themes from the research; exploring the enablers and barriers to executing the role, both generally and in relation to the reforms, as well as exploring individual responses to the SEND reforms and policy implementation.
