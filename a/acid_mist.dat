50|$|In 1907 Frederick Gardner Cottrell, a {{professor}} of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, applied for a patent on a device for charging particles and then collecting them through electrostatic attraction—the first electrostatic precipitator.

Wine-producing vineyards in northern California were being adversely affected by the lead emissions.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 {{miles north of the}} University. DuPont wanted {{to address the problem of}} precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an electrical method similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with electrostatic precipitation as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell’s work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, acid mists and fogs that spewed from turn-of-the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high-voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a gas-filled chamber from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>mist,</b> and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for pollutant removal from industrial waste flows to this day.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} risk of cancer from {{inhalation}} of mineral <b>acid</b> <b>mists.</b> METHODS [...] A cohort study and nested case-control study of upper aerodigestive tumours were carried out in men employed since 1950 at two battery plants and two steel works in Britain. The cohort was identified from personnel records and included 2678 men with definite exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>mists</b> (mainly sulphuric <b>acid),</b> 367 with possible exposure, and 1356 who were unexposed. Mortality was compared with that in the national population by the person-years method. Cases of upper aerodigestive cancer were identified from death certificates and cancer registrations, and their exposure to acids was {{compared with that of}} age matched controls (five per case) from the same plant by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS [...] In follow up to 31 December 1993, 93 % of men were traced, including 1277 who had died. Among the men definitely exposed to <b>acid</b> <b>mists,</b> overall mortality was less than in the national population (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 85 - 0. 98) as was mortality from all cancers (SMR 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 79 - 1. 05) and specifically from cancer of the larynx (SMR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 2. 70) and lung (SMR 0. 98, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 1. 22).

Methods: Fifty two workers from five plants underwent a clinical evaluation (standard questionnaire, clinical, and ear, nose, and throat examination including nasal endoscopy). for the histopathological study, 20 of the 52 subjects (study group) were randomly selected, as well as 11 unexposed subjects (control group), matched by sex, age, and smoking habits.

A total of 56 nasal mucosa specimens (37 in the study group and 19 in the control group) were evaluated with regard to normal respiratory epithelium or metaplastic epithelium, atypia or dysplasia, and. alterations of the lamina propria. Results: the histopathological study revealed squamous metaplasia in 29 (79 %) and atypia in 13 (35 %) of the 37 study group samples. No association was found between exposure duration and the clinical and histopathological variables, but a significant association was found between sulphuric acid concentrations higher than 200 mug/m(3) and pale mucosal patches and ulcerations in the exposed subjects.

One of the effective methods for <b>acid</b> <b>mist</b> control is to form a foam layer above the electrolyte surface by using surfactants. In this work, two saponin-rich products (Mistop® and QLZinc®) and a commercial Licorice product were evaluated and compared as <b>acid</b> <b>mist</b> suppressants in zinc EW. Foam properties, <b>acid</b> <b>mist</b> suppression, phase separation in solvent extraction, cathodic current efficiency (CE) and cathode quality were correlated to the addition of these surfactants. Foam properties studied included minimum soluble solids dosage for 100 % foam coverage, time required to achieve 100 % foam coverage and foam persistence time. The two saponin-rich products were found to be more effective foaming agents than Licorice. Based on foam property tests, the recommended soluble solids dosage was 1. 8, 3. 8 and 21. 6 ppm for Mistop®, QLZinc® and Licorice, respectively. At these dosages, <b>acid</b> <b>mist</b> suppression was 99 % for both Quillaja products and 94 % for Licorice. Foam coverage of 100 % was achieved with 1. 0 ppm of saponins when Mistop® was added, compared with 0. 5 ppm of saponins when QLZinc® was added, suggesting that QLZinc® contains other Quillaja solids which are surface active and positively contribute {{to improve the quality of}} foam produced. For all three <b>acid</b> <b>mist</b> suppressants tested, no significant changes in phase disengagement time and interfacial tension were detected when an organic solution was separately contacted with the zinc electrolytes containing the three agents.

It was found that seedlings were more susceptible to acid-mist and acid mist/ozone combinations, than to ozone alone. <b>Acid</b> <b>mist</b> treatment resulted in higher levels of nitrogen and sulfur (both present in <b>acid</b> <b>mist)</b> as well as Na. Leaves of giant sequoia exhibited increased K and decreased Mn, while Jeffrey pine showed increases in Fe and Mn. In sequoia leaves, concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Ba decreased. Acid treatment also reduced chlorophyll b concentrations in both conifer species. Extensive changes induced by <b>acid</b> <b>mist</b> are consistent with earlier observations of changes in spectral reflectance of conifer seedlings observed after three weeks of fumigation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increased {{risks of}} nasal cancer and lung cancer in nickel {{refiners}} {{have been investigated}} scientifically and discussed since they were detected in the 1930 s. Nickel compounds {{are considered to be}} the main cause of the cancer excess. Parts of the nickel producing industry and their consultants oppose the classification of water-soluble nickel salts as human carcinogens, and argue that the risk in exposed workers should be ascribed to other occupational exposures and smoking. Discussion: Respiratory cancer risks in Welsh, Finnish, and Norwegian nickel refiners add to the evidence of carcinogenicity of water-soluble nickel. In Norwegian refiners, the first epidemiological study in 1973 identified high risks of lung cancer and nasal cancer among long-term electrolysis workers. Risk analyses based on exposure estimates developed in the 1980 s supported the view that water-soluble nickel compounds were central in the development of cancer. Recently, new exposure estimates were worked out for the same cohort based on personal monitoring of total nickel and chemical determination of four forms of nickel. Additional data have been collected on life-time smoking habits, and on exposure to arsenic, asbestos, sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>mists,</b> cobalt, and occupational lung carcinogens outside the refinery. After adjustment for these potential confounding exposures in case-control analyses, the risk pattern added to the evidence of an important role of water-soluble nickel compounds as causes of lung cancer.

40|$|Several biotic crises {{during the}} past 300 million years {{have been linked to}} episodes of {{continental}} flood basalt volcanism, and in particular to the release of massive quantities of magmatic sulphur gas species. Flood basalt provinces were typically formed by numerous individual eruptions, each lasting years to decades. However, the environmental impact of these eruptions may have been limited by the occurrence of quiescent periods that lasted hundreds to thousands of years. Here we use a global aerosol model to quantify the sulphur-induced environmental effects of individual, decade-long flood basalt eruptions representative of the Columbia River Basalt Group, 16. 5 – 14. 5 million years ago, and the Deccan Traps, 65 million years ago. For a decade-long eruption of Deccan scale, we calculate a decadal-mean reduction in global surface temperature of 4. 5 [*]K, which would recover within 50 years after an eruption ceased unless climate feedbacks were very different in deep-time climates. <b>Acid</b> <b>mists</b> and fogs could have caused immediate damage to vegetation in some regions, but acid-sensitive land and marine ecosystems were well-buffered against volcanic sulphur deposition effects even during century-long eruptions. We conclude that magmatic sulphur from flood basalt eruptions would have caused a biotic crisis only if eruption frequencies and lava discharge rates had been high and sustained for several centuries at a time...|$|R
