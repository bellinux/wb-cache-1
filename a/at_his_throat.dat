5|$|By {{the time}} Robert dies, Renly has fled the capital, and Joffrey has already ordered his own {{coronation}} within a fortnight. As Ned {{and his allies}} enter the throne room, he gives Ser Barristan Selmy Robert's will to read out aloud. Cersei refuses to follow Robert's will and tears it up, ordering Barristan to seize Ned. Ned orders his men to arrest Cersei and Joffrey. As both sides prepare to fight, the City Watch slaughters the Stark men while Littlefinger holds Ned with a knife <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> telling Ned {{that he should have}} listened to Littlefinger's advice about distrusting him.|$|E
5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E
500|$|After the {{excitement}} of this combat, garrison duty again became routine. Butler had a very large Eagle, Globe, and Anchor tattoo made which started <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and extended to his waist. He also met Littleton Waller, a fellow Marine with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. When Waller received command of a company in Guam, {{he was allowed to}} select five officers to take with him. He chose Butler. Before they had departed, their orders were changed and they were sent to China aboard the [...] to help put down the Boxer Rebellion.|$|E
60|$|Edward Cossey's {{face turned}} {{perfectly}} livid with fury, and he drew himself up {{as though to}} spring <b>at</b> <b>his</b> adversary's <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|Evans stumbled, {{and then}} with a sudden curse flung the coat from him. He stood for a moment staring at Hooker, {{and then with}} a groan {{clutched}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>throat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Chauvelin, she knew, {{was past}} master {{in the art}} of putting a knife <b>at</b> <b>his</b> victim's <b>throat</b> and of giving it just the {{necessary}} twist with his cruel and relentless [...] "unless"! ...|$|R
2500|$|After midnight, Myles summoned Jones {{to talk to}} the media. [...] Through Jones, Myles {{warned that}} any {{offensive}} action against the prison would end in the killing of the hostages by fire, hanging, or stabbing. [...] Myles then spoke up, telling the amassed media that he was fighting for better conditions and just wanted to be heard. [...] He again threatened the hostages with death if any action was taken against the prison and paraded Jones in front of the windows with a knife <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> to make his point. [...] Afterward, Myles led Jones back to a cell.|$|E
2500|$|However, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the password was actually obtained by Lieutenant Colonel Harvey. According to an account given after the war by Frederick Snider, a neighbour of the Gages, Harvey had executed a ruse on the first sentry to be accosted. Pretending to be the American officer of the day making Grand Rounds, he approached the sentry and when challenged, came close to the sentry's ear as if to whisper the countersign. But with bayonet secreted in hand, he grabbed the surprised sentry by the throat and threw him to the ground. With the bayonet <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> the sentry gave up the password. This suggestion illustrates the incomplete research into several aspects of the Battle of Stoney Creek. Snider gave this account not long before his death in 1877 [...] and his source for it was the April 1871 issue of The Canadian Literary Journal. [...] Snider was confusing Harvey with Colonel Murray, June 1813 with December 1813 and Stoney Creek with Youngstown near Fort Niagara. Snider makes several obvious errors, such as [...] "the British General St. Vincent was found some days after wandering about in the woods nearly dead of hunger." [...] His name was Vincent and he did not wander about the woods for days. [...] Snider's source for the provenance of the countersign should thus be considered to be unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|Outside the walls, Warden Powell {{was busy}} {{trying to deal with}} budding public {{reaction}} to the riot. [...] The word had leaked quickly, and wives of guards who were hostages started showing up at his house. [...] Powell decided to again enter the prison through the tunnel system which gave access to the gun ports in the mess hall and the catwalks in the cellblocks. [...] Luckily, the riot leaders had been unable to secure a key to the access points to this tunnel system, or else Powell may have been taken hostage again. [...] Just after sundown, Powell made his way through the tunnels to the mess hall and shouted for Myles and Smart. [...] Myles showed up, leading Jones with a knife <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] Powell asked what Myles wanted, and received a verbal tirade from Myles, who stalked away, leaving Jones with Alton. [...] Powell was told that Myles wanted at least thirty members of the press to come inside the prison, take pictures of the conditions and speak with the inmates. [...] Powell offered to get three reporters inside the walls under the understanding that they would not print a word of what they learned until the hostages were released. [...] Alton agreed to the plan. [...] Powell returned to his residence to await the coming day.|$|E

60|$|The prince, {{whatever}} he was, was evidently not a coward; he sprang <b>at</b> <b>his</b> enemy's <b>throat</b> and almost bore him backwards to the grass. But his enemy extricated {{himself with a}} singularly inappropriate air of hurried politeness.|$|R
60|$|On Gomez {{coming up}} to him, Jasper raised one hand to point <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>throat.</b> Gomez noted the {{somewhat}} soiled state of his white clothes, then took one look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face, and fled away to order the drink for which Jasper seemed to be asking.|$|R
60|$|Verronax smiled slightly, {{and touched}} the collar <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} I was sitting upon him, my dagger <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|The fingers <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> relaxed, a puzzled, far-away {{expression}} softened {{the gray}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|Peppino {{knelt in}} silence, {{a cold sweat}} {{gathering}} on his pale brow, and a horrid fear tightening <b>at</b> <b>his</b> heart and <b>throat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{brief but}} violent skirmish, for de Marmont had made a {{movement}} as if he meant to spring <b>at</b> <b>his</b> rival's <b>throat,</b> and Général Marchand and the Vicomte de Génevois, {{who happened to be}} near, had much ado to seize and hold him: even so they could not stop the hoarse cries which he uttered: ...|$|R
60|$|On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, {{it seemed}} to him, at each step. He thrust up the trap, and called to the man to drive faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw <b>at</b> him. <b>His</b> <b>throat</b> burned, and <b>his</b> {{delicate}} hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse madly with his stick. The driver laughed, and whipped up. He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{felt himself}} redden to {{the soles of}} his feet, and a sob caught <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E

6000|$|As I {{have walked}} in Alabama my morning walk, I have seen where the she-bird, the mocking-bird, {{sat on her}} nest in the [...] briars, {{hatching}} her brood.

60|$|The {{old woman}} looked at him, {{as though she}} had a strong impulse upon her to make another clutch <b>at</b> <b>his</b> head and <b>throat,</b> but was {{restrained}} by a certain dogged mystery in his face.|$|R
60|$|When Peter {{reached the}} place where he had caught a glimpse of Mummer, no one was to be seen. Peter sat down, {{uncertain}} which way to go. Suddenly Mummer popped out right in front of Peter, seemingly from nowhere <b>at</b> all. <b>His</b> <b>throat</b> and breast were bright yellow and his back wings and tail a soft olive-green. But the most remarkable thing about him was the mask of black right across his cheeks, eyes and forehead. At least it looked like a mask, although it really wasn't one.|$|R
6000|$|The fellow whimpered and did {{not answer}} until my dagger's edge was <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> again. Then he {{suddenly}} screeched--"Yes!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Ramesses {{died before}} the records which have survived were written, as in them he is {{referred}} to as [...] "the Great God", a term used only for deceased kings <b>at</b> this time. <b>His</b> <b>throat</b> was cut during the plot, as revealed by a CAT scan of his mummy. He was succeeded by his son Ramesses-Heqamaatre-Meriamun, known to us as Ramesses IV.|$|R
60|$|Kaviri battled bravely {{against his}} antagonist, for {{he felt that}} death had already claimed him, and so the least {{that he could do}} would be to sell his life as dearly as possible; but it was soon evident that his best was quite futile when pitted against the superhuman brawn and agility of the {{creature}} that <b>at</b> last found <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and bent him back {{into the bottom of the}} canoe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither of us, Father. I am {{disguised}} {{as an old}} man, but really I am little more than eighteen. I have been searching for you {{for more than two}} years, and, thank God, I have found you at last;" [...] and, bursting into tears, Dick would have thrown his arms round his father's neck, but the latter pushed him off with one hand, and held him at arm's distance, while his other hand plucked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>throat,</b> as if to loosen something that was choking him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suffragettes," [...] gasped Uncle Jim {{with the}} ferule <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "Everywhere!" [...] and aimed a second more {{successful}} blow at Mr. Polly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fight {{him down}} in your own heart, then, dear," [...] Mrs. Trevennack said, gently. [...] "Remember, we all may fall. Lucifer did--and he was once an archangel.

But he laughed alone, {{and when he}} discovered it he looked around at our faces. I had reached his side {{and was trying to}} get him to come away, but he took no notice of me. He was gazing, fascinated, at Kaluna, who was brushing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>throat</b> in a flurried, nervous way, as if to brush off the contamination of the fingers that had clutched him. The action was unreasoned, genuine.|$|R
50|$|It {{was said}} {{that no one could}} tell a lie or move, with Fragarach <b>at</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>throat,</b> thus the name 'Answerer'.
