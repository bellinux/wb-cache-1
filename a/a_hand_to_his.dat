2500|$|The Valar then {{learned that}} Melkor was {{manipulating}} Fëanor, and sent Tulkas to capture Melkor, {{but he had}} already escaped. With Finwë and Fëanor's absence, Fingolfin had become king, and so it seemed that Melkor's lies were true. Melkor tried again to convince Fëanor of them, but Fëanor realised that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, [...] "and he shut the doors of his house {{in the face of}} the mightiest of all the dwellers in Eä." [...] In a rage, Melkor left. The Valar invited Fëanor and Fingolfin to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> half-brother, recognising Fëanor's place as the eldest. He gave his pledge to follow his elder brother and Fëanor accepted.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Mant {{cleared his}} throat again and put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mustache.|$|E
60|$|The {{headmaster}} pressed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead, and {{his mind}} swam into the future.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he started}} out of a vague reverie and pressed <b>an</b> investigatory <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> side.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the trader {{ceased to}} paddle, and raised <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> shade <b>his</b> {{eyes from the}} sun.|$|R
60|$|He bent lower, murmuring incoherently, {{and she put}} up <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> pat <b>his</b> swarthy bearded cheek.|$|R
60|$|He beat at {{the arms}} of his chair and then put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> throat.|$|E
60|$|Then he roused {{himself with}} a {{profound}} sigh, and put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cut and bruised cheek.|$|E
60|$|But the man shrieked at the contact, {{clapping}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> side in evident pain. He rose {{slowly to}} his feet, half {{leaning on the}} table.|$|E
5000|$|Karroubi publicized his {{policies}} by publishing four electoral declarations. According <b>to</b> <b>a</b> paper <b>handed</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> supporters {{during the campaign}} his main policies are: ...|$|R
6000|$|Wilfred put <b>a</b> weak <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, {{and asked}} in a low voice: [...] "How {{did you know that}} his hat looked like a green beetle?" ...|$|R
60|$|She rose at {{once with}} <b>an</b> {{extended}} <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>his</b> hesitation.|$|R
6000|$|He saw light, dazzling, blinding, and {{it scared}} him. He fell back, <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brow. [...] "And {{that was why}} you fainted?" [...] he asked incredulously.|$|E
60|$|Raising <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mouth, he gave {{a shrill}} {{imitation}} of the call to cease firing, and then lost his balance and fell over the chair with a crash.|$|E
60|$|TOM ROCHFORD: (<b>A</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> breastbone, bows) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a {{resolute}} stare) My {{turn now}} on. Follow {{me up to}} Carlow.|$|E
60|$|Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, {{bowed to}} suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (<b>a</b> lady's) <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.|$|R
50|$|Belotti is {{nickname}}d Il Gallo (The Rooster). The nickname {{comes from}} the surname of his close childhood friend, who jokingly suggested he celebrate his goals by mimicking a rooster's comb with <b>an</b> open <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed his}} long thin lips an instant but, {{eager to be}} on, raised <b>an</b> outspanned <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{spectacles}} and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} cabin-door flew open, and Don Miguel himself, tall, sunburned, and aquiline of face, strode in. Lord Julian span round, to face him, and clapped <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sword.|$|E
6000|$|The Basha stayed yet a moment, as if {{he would}} have spoken. Then {{abruptly}} he turned and waved <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> janissaries. [...] "Away!" [...] was all he said to them, and stalked out in their wake.|$|E
60|$|He made a {{pretense of}} leaving, {{and he put}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> pocket as if to insure the safety of some article. Columbine blushed. She held out her hands. She was repentant of her words and curious as to his.|$|E
6000|$|Her eyelids fluttered, {{she drew}} a long sighing breath, and nestled closer to him. [...] "Anthony!" [...] she murmured again, and reached up <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stroke <b>his</b> face, <b>to</b> feel that it was truly living flesh.|$|R
5000|$|Shane lent <b>a</b> helping <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friends, Tooth & Nail Records {{recording}} artists Plankeye, in July 1998. After their drummer resigned, Shane {{filled in}} on their U.S. tour to support their fourth CD [...] "The One and Only".|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jenkins got <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, in a slow, foolish fashion. He put out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stay <b>his</b> lordship. The lady, in the background, {{looked on}} with wide eyes, very breathless, one <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her bosom {{as if to}} control its heave.|$|R
60|$|And Sir Rowland, realizing, too, by {{now that}} here was no ghost, {{recovered}} his lost courage. He put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sword, then withdrew it, leaving the weapon sheathed. Here was a hangman's job, not a swordsman's, he opined--and wisely, for he had had earlier experience of Mr. Wilding's play of steel.|$|E
6000|$|... "False?" [...] {{he cried}} with scorn. [...] "Come, now, be reasonable. The truth, ere torture sucks {{it out of}} you. Reflect that I know all--exactly as you told it me. How was it, now? Lurking behind a bush you sprang upon him unawares and ran him through before he could so much as lay <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sword, and so...." ...|$|E
60|$|Of his gentlemen {{the doctor}} sat frozen with terror in his high-backed seat, {{clutching}} {{the arms of}} it so that his knuckles showed white as marble. In like case were the two attendant servants, who hung motionless by the buffet. But Sforza-Fogliani, a man of some spirit for all his effeminate appearance, leapt {{to his feet and}} set <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> weapons.|$|E
60|$|Denbigh waved <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> {{the servant}} <b>to</b> retire, and <b>handed</b> <b>a</b> chair <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A Japanese {{soldier in}} the sea off Cape Endaiadere, New Guinea, on 18 December 1942 holding <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> grenade <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head moments before using it to commit suicide. The Australian soldier on the beach had called on him to surrender.|$|R
60|$|With {{intent to}} show Bill {{that he did}} not greatly fear his smiles, the youth sprang down and offered <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> assist <b>his</b> charming fellow-passenger <b>to</b> alight; and she, with kindly understanding, again {{accepted}} his aid--to Bill's chagrin--and they walked up the path side by side.|$|R
60|$|Barret and Milly {{had landed}} just before them. Immediately after Archie and Eddie were swept in amid the foam, and Junkie himself--who, like his brothers, could swim like a cork--came careering {{in on the}} top of a wave, like a very water-imp! With all the energy of his nature he turned, the moment his feet touched ground, to lend <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Tonal', who was not far behind him.|$|E
60|$|But this delay {{drew the}} {{attention}} of Jacob Welse, and, {{as he tried to}} make out the cause, the chairman found his chance. Without crooking, his right arm swept out and down, the heavy caulking-mallet leaping from his hand. It spanned the short distance and smote Jacob Welse below the ear. His revolver went off as he fell, and John the Swede grunted and clapped <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> thigh.|$|E
60|$|This day Lenore Anderson {{had seemed}} a bewildering {{fulfilment}} of the sweetness {{he had imagined}} was latent in her. She had meant what was beyond him to understand. She had gently put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lips, to check the bitter words, and he had dared to kiss her soft fingers. The thrill, the sweetness, the incomprehensible and perhaps imagined response of her pulse would never leave him. He watched the big car until {{it was out of}} sight.|$|E
60|$|Farnese made a gurgling {{sound and}} put <b>a</b> jewelled <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> throat {{as if he}} choked. He was all in green velvet, and every button of his doublet was a {{brilliant}} of price; and that gay raiment by its incongruity seemed to heighten {{the tragedy of the}} moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{nothing about}} it, madam," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Your son won my heart, and I was only too {{glad to be}} of service to him and my old comrade here. What {{is the use of}} a man winning {{victories}} if he cannot lend <b>a</b> helping <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friends!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{suffered}} in <b>a</b> fit of anger when he punched out {{a wall in}} his hauler at the previous weekend's race in Watkins Glen, Kyle Petty was replaced in the No. 45 as Chad McCumbee for that race only.|$|R
