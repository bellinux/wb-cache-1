25|$|Most {{spinning}} {{today is}} done using Break or Open-end spinning, {{this is a}} technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces. This method has replaced the older methods of ring and mule spinning. It also is easily adapted for <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{field has}} {{recommended}} FIFA dimensions of [...] It was prepared by World Sports {{in partnership with}} Desso. The field {{is made up of}} Perennial Ryegrass, which is grown directly at the site. The original idea was to use black grass to avoid the colours of PalmeirasCorinthians' biggest rivalsbut it was proved to be technically impossible and the club chose to use grass with a darker hue. To improve fixation, the grass is intertwined with 22million <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres.</b> Ultraviolet lights are used nightly to ensure that all parts of the pitch will receive equal lighting; the field is exposed to only two hours of direct sunlight per day.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} optimum grass playing {{surface in the}} stadium bowl, the roof was {{designed}} to maximise sunlight by using a ten-metre band of translucent polycarbonate at its periphery. Additionally, each of {{the corners of the}} stadium without seating have perforated walls with moveable [...] that can be adjusted to provide ventilation of the grass and general airflow through the stadium. Drainage and under-pitch heating were installed to provide optimum growing conditions for the grass. The pitch has a UEFA standard dimension of [...] and is covered with natural grass reinforced by <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres</b> made by Desso. The field of play is lit by 218 2000-watt floodlights, consuming a total of 436,000 watts.

2500|$|In modern times, saris are {{increasingly}} woven on mechanical looms {{and made of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres,</b> such as polyester, nylon, or rayon, which do not require starching or ironing. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with floats {{across the back of}} the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The punchra work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer Aaditya Sharma declared, [...] "I can drape a sari in 54 different styles".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to making the}} field compatible for CFL games, the upgrades, which were originally budgeted for $115–120 million, added a new upper deck on the east side, raising capacity from 21,566 seats to 30,000 for soccer, with 26,500 seats in CFL configuration, and is temporarily expandable with additional end zone seating to 40,000 for big {{events such as the}} rugby sevens at the 2015 Pan-Am games, NHL outdoor games, Grey Cup, MLS Cup, possible 2028 Summer Olympics or later or a successful 2026 FIFA World Cup by Canada. [...] The plans called for $30 million retractable end zone seating in the south and a retractable terrace in the north end to ensure that fans aren't farther from the playing surface in soccer configuration due to the longer CFL field, and a roof over most permanent seating areas. [...] Leiweke promised that soccer playing surface will remain natural grass. [...] A reinforced hybrid playing surface such as Desso GrassMaster, in which <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres</b> are embedded in the turf to allow for the grass roots to intertwine with them to strengthen the pitch, was originally under consideration, but concerns that this would complicate repairs to the pitch led MLSE to decide against it. [...] A $1 million subsurface heating system and a $1 million artificial lighting system were installed to encourage grass growth, and MLSE secured an exemption to use pesticides on the field. [...] Portions of the CFL end zones are artificial turf. [...] Removable paint is used for lining the field to allow for the football lines to be removed prior to soccer games. [...] As well, the field has two football goalpost configurations so that the same grass isn't relined every game. [...] Under a two-phase construction process, the field was lengthened and the capacity of the stadium increased for $77 million by May 1, 2015, with the roof added by May 1, 2016 for $43 million.|$|E

Key words: Nylon bags, protein, starch disappearance, by-products, forages The use of substantial levels of sugar cane by-products in ruminant diets is of significant importance in the economics of meat and milk production in Mauritius and other sugar producing countries. Such feeds must, however, be supplemented with materials providing a certain amount of starch and pre-formed protein for performance-to be profitable (Leng & Preston 1976).
