To assess future usage intention and purchase intention, each of three items developed by Ma et al. (2014) were used. To evaluate socially responsible consumption behavior, twenty items using a 7 -point Likert scale developed by Francois-Lecompte and Roberts (2006) were utilized. Six items developed by Zaichkowsky (1985) were adopted to measure the level of apparel product involvement as a control <b>variable.</b> <b>All</b> <b>items</b> excluding socially responsible consumption behavior were measured using a 7 -point semantic differential scale.

It is not low inflation, high inflation or hyperinflation doing the eroding. It is the implementation of the stable measuring unit assumption during low inflation, high inflation and hyperinflation. Constant real value non-monetary items are measured in units of CPP in terms of a daily rate at all levels of inflation and deflation. Monetary items are inflation-adjusted daily. Net monetary losses and gains are calculated when monetary items are not inflation-adjusted daily in terms of a daily rate. <b>Variable</b> <b>items</b> are measured in terms of IFRS and then updated daily in terms of a daily rate. <b>All</b> non-monetary <b>items</b> (<b>variable</b> real value non-monetary items and constant real value non-monetary items) in Historical Cost or Current Cost period-end financial statements are restated in terms of the period-end monthly published CPI during hyperinflation as required in IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} how perceived risks impact attitude and perceived enjoyment and further behavioral intention toward clothing rental. A convenience sampling strategy was utilized with an online survey. A consumer panel of the target population was purchased from an online research company.

Evidence from the study indicates that consumer intentions to rent clothing is encouraged by their attitudes and perceived enjoyment; but impeded by the perceived financial, performance, and psychological risks. Further, the results highlight the mediating role perceived enjoyment has on the negative relationship between perceived risks and clothing renting intentions...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} how children’s event representations changed with increasing experience with an event. There were 81 children (40 4 -to- 5 -year-olds, and 41 7 -to- 8 -year-olds) {{who participated in}} either 2 (n = 41) or 4 (n = 40) repeated event sessions, which consisted of activities such as playing a counting game, and/or doing a puzzle. Event sessions included three different <b>item</b> types; <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> (which changed at every occurrence), fixed items (which stayed constant throughout the event), and new items (which only occurred once throughout the series). Children were interviewed 5 - 7 - days following their last event session using free-recall, as well as specific questioning phases (where they were asked about every item in the series). Increasing experience aided in recalling more fixed items, but was detrimental to recall of <b>variable</b> and new <b>items.</b> Older children had a better ability to recall fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>items,</b> but not necessarily new items than younger children.

40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an {{autoimmune}} {{neuromuscular disorder}} in which disabling muscle weakness may affect health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate which common motor-functional deficits and corresponding severity are most determinant of poor HRQoL in these patients. In 41 patients, the dichotomized first item of the Italian Myasthenia Gravis Questionnaire (IMGQ), categorizing patients who report "good" and "poor" HRQoL, was chosen as dependent-outcome <b>variable.</b> <b>All</b> <b>items</b> composing the myasthenia gravis-specific scale (MG-ADL), i. e. talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, impairment of ability to brush teeth or comb hair, impairment of ability to rise from chair, double vision, and eyelid droop were acquired as independent variables and dichotomized. Stepwise backward LR multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. In addition, the main characteristics of patients were compared. MG-ADL items "chewing" >= 1, i. e. "fatigue chewing solid food", and "breathing" >= 2, i. e. "shortness of breath at rest" proved to be significant determinants. Higher dose of corticosteroid therapy was significantly (p = 0. 027; r(s) = - 0. 35), correlated with poor HRQoL. At diagnosis, a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) from the abductor pollicis brevis was significantly more frequent in patients with poor HRQoL. In conclusion, impaired "chewing" and "breathing" functions indicate the need for careful planning of rehabilitation, re-education and patient management. Moreover, decremental response to RNS at diagnosis may identify patients at risk for poor HRQoL...|$|R

40|$|Health-related {{quality of}} life (HRQL) was defined for farmed animals and {{identified}} as an appropriate focus of integrative welfare measurement for farmed pigs that embraces measurement of positive welfare. The instrument for HRQL measurement was developed specifically for use by farmers and stockpersons, the prime carers of pigs, to increase ownership of welfare improvement amongst those groups. Using a psychometric approach to instrument development, relevant observations were determined by consultation with experienced farmers and stockpersons. These observations included causal variables (cause changes in HRQL) and indicator variables (manifest changes in HRQL). The <b>variables</b> selected as <b>items</b> in the structured questionnaire instrument were those most commonly applied by farmers and stockpersons and also were assigned similar quality-of-life impact by a range of experts including pig veterinary specialists and welfare scientists. The prototype instrument comprises a questionnaire with 98 causal <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> (covering five domains of welfare according with the Five Freedoms) and 30 indicator <b>variable</b> <b>items.</b> It was pre-tested with farmers and stockpersons on commercial farm units and {{was found to have}} content (face) validity and high utility.
