This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify the brand name. Instead, it means that consumers can recognise the brand when presented with it at the point-of-sale or after viewing its visual packaging. In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognise it.|$|E

40|$|Research {{from the}} past decades has shown that {{retrieval}} of a speciffic memory (e. g., retrieving part of a previous vacation) typically attenuates retrieval of other memories (e. g., memories for other details of the event), causing retrieval-induced forgetting. More recently, however, {{it has been shown}} that retrieval can both attenuate and <b>aid</b> <b>recall</b> of other memories (K. -H. T. Bäuml & A. Samenieh, 2010). To identify the circumstances under which retrieval <b>aids</b> <b>recall,</b> we examined retrieval dynamics in listwise directed forgetting, context-dependent forgetting, proactive interference, and in the absence of any induced memory impairment. We found benefificial effffects of selective retrieval in listwise directed forgetting and context- depedent forgetting, but detrimental effects in all the other conditions. Because context-dependent forgetting and listwise directed forgetting arguably reflect impaired context access, the results suggest that memory retrieval <b>aids</b> <b>recall</b> of memories that are subject to impaired context access, but attenuates recall in the absence of such circumstances. The findings are consistent with a two-factor account of memory retrieval and suggest the existence of two faces of memory retrieval...|$|R

40|$|Survey {{questionnaires}} commonly include retrospective {{questions on}} attitudes {{as a substitute}} for concurrently obtained assessments. Empirical studies have shown that these retrospectively obtained attitudes often deviate seriously from the attitudes for which they are substitutes: the attitude that respondents held in the past. In spite of this, hardly any research has been done to examine whether <b>aided</b> <b>recall</b> methods might be able to minimize such a discrepancy. The present study provides a first empirical test of a cue-list which was used as an <b>aided</b> <b>recall</b> method for retrospective attitude questions about unemployment. The cue-list consisted of a standardized set of cues – advantages and disadvantages of being unemployed – that was added to a retrospective attitude question on unemployment. It was tested in a randomized field experiment during the second wave (1991) of a longitudinal social survey in the Netherlands. The cue-list was expected to enhance the reconstruction of the past attitudes of those respondents who had actually been unemployed {{at the time of the}} first interview. Respondents who had not been unemployed were treated as a control group. The agreement between the recalled attitude and the attitude reported in the first wave of the survey, four years earlier, was used to evaluate the effects of the cue-list. Contrary to expectation, the cue-list led to a lower instead of a higher level of agreement. However, in line with Tulving’s encoding specificity principle, the “unemployment” cue-list did have this unexpected effect only for the respondents who had been unemployed at the time of the first interview and not for the control group. In addition, the cue-list led to a more positive attitude towards unemployment, in retrospect, for the former group of respondents. Exploratory analyses suggest that the cues might have triggered positive features of unemployment that could have been easily overlooked otherwise.

5000|$|Roediger {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{scholars}} to see the value of studying how humans retrieve memories. As Roediger started his career the cognitive revolution was in full swing. Human memory researchers had been predominantly focusing on memory storage, and were only beginning to look at memory encoding. However, inspired by his graduate advisor at Yale, Robert G. Crowder, Roediger began to see the importance of a retrieval-based approach to memory research. [...] Since his doctoral dissertation, much of Roediger's research through the 1970s focused on retrieval based inhibition - the idea that retrieving an item reduces the subsequent accessibility of other stored items. This phenomenon is more commonly experienced when we try to remember a list of items and find that we keep thinking of the ones we have already recalled, rather than the ones we still need to remember. Roediger was able to show, under certain conditions, that recall cues can inhibit recall, which seemed inconsistent with previously widely accepted research findings showing that cues <b>aid</b> <b>recall.</b> Close to a decade of research helped to define the situations in which cues can <b>aid</b> <b>recall</b> and the situations in which cues can inhibit recall. In 1978 Roediger concluded that this dissociation occurs because, although some cues can facilitate recall, other cues provide irrelevant information, which hinders recall. Most importantly, Roediger showed the world that the accessibility of one memory biases the process of searching for another memory.|$|R

40|$|Retrospective {{reports in}} survey {{interviews}} and questionnaires {{are subject to}} many types of recall error, which affect completeness, consistency, and dating accuracy. Concerns about this problem {{have led to the}} development of so-called calendar instruments, or timeline techniques.

Calendar techniques are currently used in a variety of fields, including life course research, epidemiology and family planning studies. Despite the growing interest in these new methods, their application often lacks sufficient theoretical foundation and little attention has been paid to their effectiveness.

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that age-related memory {{differences}} can be eliminated when older adults are able to use existing schematic knowledge to <b>aid</b> <b>recall</b> or recognition. This study investigates the role of schema, and additionally, the role of novelty in associated memory across older and younger adult age groups.

Consistent with previous findings no age-related differences were present in the recall of market value prices, and younger participants outperformed older participants with regard to overpriced items. This suggests that previous existing schematic knowledge does <b>aid</b> memory <b>recall,</b> and promote the elimination of age-related differences. However, additionally, no age related differences were identified in the underpriced or novel conditions, possibly suggesting the role of additional memory effecting factors. Furthermore, no age-related differences were identified in the accuracy of older and younger adults’ recollection and familiarity responses across all price conditions. This suggests that both distinct aspects of recognition may be less sensitive to memory decline, and is inconsistent with previous literature that has suggested the ability to produce accurate recollection declines with normal ageing...|$|R

40|$|Potential for {{trademark}} dilution {{occurs when}} a new brand introduces itself with an identical or substantially similar mark to that of an existing brand. Currently, there is neither a clear standard for legal proof of dilution nor widely accepted measures for managerial use. Using a shared-brand-network model, the authors use three different but conceptually related measurement methodologies (response latency, <b>aided</b> <b>recall,</b> and simulated choice) across five experiments to examine “blurring ” dilution effects. The results suggest that when junior brands operate in similar categories and position on similar attributes, there is no immediate threat of blurring dilution. However, if the junior brand chooses to position on dissimilar attributes in a similar category, dilution of attribute associations is likely. When the junior brand operates in dissimilar categories, there is a threat of blurring dilution for both category and attribute associations. The final two studies demonstrate that dilution of junior brands (i. e., operating in dissimilar categories positioned on dissimilar attributes) can suppress consideration and choice probabilities for the senior brand and that this effect may extend {{over a period of}} time.

Three word lists were used; one was highly structured in a hierarchical manner, or moderately structured, and one unstructured. Two types of instructions were given; one to categorize the words, the other to categorize the words and also to look for hierarchical relationships among the categories. The words in each list were presented in random order. Subjects were presented with a list of words, one at a time, and asked to write the words into a blank array of cells. This was intended as an aid to organization of the words. Subjects then recalled as many words as they could. There were three such organization-recall trials, to allow an evaluation {{of the effects of the}} independent variables over time. It was found that a list with a high degree of inherent organization was learned more readily than the list with no organization. It was also found that the more organization a subject was found to impose on a list, the better the recall of the list. Instructions to categorize word lists hierarchically were expected to aid in the organization imposed on a list by the subject, thereby <b>aiding</b> <b>recall.</b> Results showed that such instructions were only effective with subjects receiving the highly structured list.
