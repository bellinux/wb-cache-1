The FCF {{will be a}} permanent installation for scientific microgravity experiments in the U. S. Laboratory Module aboard the ISS. The ability to withstand faults is vital for all ISS installations. Currently, the FCF safety specification requires one-component fault-tolerance. In future versions, even greater robustness may be required. Faults encountered by ISS modules vary in nature and extent. Self-stabilization is an adequate approach to tolerance design of the FCF. However, for systems as complex as the FCF, <b>analytical</b> <b>tolerance</b> verification is not feasible. We use automated model-checking. We model the FCF in SPIN and specify stabilization predicates to which FCF must conform. Our model of FCF allows us to inject component faults as well as hazardous conditions. We use SPIN to automatically verify the convergence of the FCF model to legitimate states...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of endocrine tests {{depends on the}} choice of tests, {{the preparation of the}} patients, the integrity of the specimens, the quality of the measurements, and the validity of the reference data. Close dialogue among the clinicians, the laboratory, and the patients is a key factor for optimal patient care. The characteristics of urine and plasma samples and the advantages and limitations of paired test measurements are presented. The importance of test sequence strategies, provocative or inhibitory procedures, and elimination of drug interferences is illustrated with four cases involving Cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism, and hypercalcemia. For each of these scenarios, key clinical issues are highlighted, along with discussions of the best test strategies, including which medications are likely to interfere. The importance of targeting laboratory tests to answer well-focused clinical decisions is emphasized. The roles of some time-honored provocative procedures are questioned in light of more sensitive and specific analytic methods. The importance of decision-focused <b>analytical</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits is emphasized by demonstrating the impact of analytic bias on downstream medical resource utilization. User-friendly support systems to facilitate the implementation of test strategies and postanalytic tracking of patient outcomes are presented as essential requirements for quality medical practice. © 1999 American Association for Clinical Chemistry Consider the hypothetical situation in which laboratory tests are limited (precious resources that are rationed) such that a healthcare provider could use only a controlled number of resource units per definable patient care outcome event. In this perhaps not so hypothetical environment, a clinician would want to ensure that the mos...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of an alignment technique used for an off-plane reflection grating system that, if proven to be feasible, would ideally be utilized for future astronomical x-ray spectrometers. The use of reflection gratings allows {{for the production of}} both high throughput and spectral resolution. As such, they are a candidate grating technology for future soft X-ray spectroscopy missions. To be viable for these missions, however, a low-cost optical technique for co-aligning multiple gratings into a module for use in a spectrograph must be demonstrated. The off-plane grating module was built to contain fifteen gratings with proper relative alignment to one another for a converging X-ray beam. The module was coupled with a silicon pore optic mirror to produce a spectrum of reflected and diffracted light onto a CCD camera at the focal plane. The alignment performance of the module’s grating system was assessed both before and after a series of vibrational and thermal tests were conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Data reduction was done in order to identify the number and position of photon events from the diffraction spots for each grating, and raytracing analysis was conducted in order to calculate the induced grating-to-grating angular misalignments. Finally, these measurements were compared to theoretical alignment <b>tolerances</b> derived using <b>analytical</b> techniques. The grating system yielded misalignments within a factor of 2 - 3 of the <b>analytical</b> <b>tolerances,</b> which is very encouraging for a first attempt. Further refinement and troubleshooting is required {{to see whether or not}} this alignment technique can be used in the future...|$|R
40|$|Durability {{and damage}} {{tolerance}} (D&DT) issues {{are critical to}} the development of lighter, safer and more efficient aerospace vehicles. Durability is largely an economic life-cycle design consideration whereas damage tolerance directly addresses the structural airworthiness (safety) of the vehicle. Both D&DT methodologies must address the deleterious effects of changes in material properties and the initiation and growth of damage that may occur during the vehicle s service lifetime. The result of unanticipated D&DT response is often manifested in the form of catastrophic and potentially fatal accidents. As such, durability and damage tolerance requirements must be rigorously addressed for commercial transport aircraft and NASA spacecraft systems.

30|$|A {{cryogenic}} {{transfer system}} including flexible cryogenic transfer lines of corrugated type of total length 220  m has been installed at NSRRC (Lin et al. 2010) to deliver LHe for a cryogenic test stand. This system {{might be the}} longest cryogenic flexible lines ever implemented for similar applications. A successful design of cryogenic transfer lines {{has been made to}} provide the demanded cooling capacity at the cryogenic test stand based on our simple <b>analytical</b> approach with <b>tolerance</b> factor 1.5 in the estimate of pressure drops of the cryogenic transfer lines. The objective of a long-term reliability test of a KEKB-type SRF module examined at gap voltage 1.6 MV over weeks when the SRF module on duty at TLS operates routinely was also achieved. The test result proves also that value 1.5 of tolerance factor suits well a long-distance helium transfer line of this kind during a design phase.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{well-known}} Clos {{network has}} been extensively used for telephone switching, multiprocessor interconnection and data communications. Much {{work has been done}} to develop analytical models for understanding the routing blocking probability of the Clos network. However, none of the analytical models for estimating the blocking probability of this type of network have taken into account the very real possibility of the interstage links in the network failing. In this paper, we consider the routing between arbitrary network inputs and outputs in the Clos network in the presence of interstage link faults. In particular, we present an analytical model for the routing blocking probability of the Clos network which incorporates the probability of interstage link failure to allow for a more realistic and useful determination of the approximation of blocking probabiliiy. We also conduct extensive Simulations to validate the model. Our analytical and simulation results demonstrate that for a relatively small interstage link failure probability, the blocking behavior of the Clos network {{is similar to that of}} a fault-free network, and indicate that the Clos network has a good fault-tolerant capability, The new integrated analytical model can guide network designers in the determination of the effects of network failure on the overall connecting capability of the network and allows for the examination of the relationship between network utilization and network failure.

40|$|Traditionally, {{solid axle}} railway {{wheelsets}} are stabilised by using passive suspensions on a conventional rail vehicle, but such additional stiffness affects the pure rolling {{action of the}} wheelset around the curve. It has been theoretically proven that this design conflict between stability and curving performance can be solved by applying active control instead of conventional passive components, resulting in {{the reduction of the}} wear of the wheels and track by minimising the track shifting forces. In the active approach, the use of actuators, sensors and data processors to replace the traditional passive suspension raises the issue of the system safety {{in the event of a}} failure of the active control, which could result in the loss of stability and in more severe cases, derailment. Further on, in active control systems for railway vehicles the actuators tend to be significantly more expensive and require more additional space than sensors, and an electronic control unit. Therefore, developing an <b>analytical</b> redundancy-based fault <b>tolerance</b> technique for an actively controlled wheelset that minimises the number of actuators will clearly be more beneficial. Thus the emphasis of this research is to develop a fault-tolerant system of active control for a railway vehicle in the event of actuator malfunction in order to guarantee stability and good curving performance without using additional actuators. The key achievements of this research can be summarised as follows: •	The research considers three of the most common types of actuator failure for the electro-mechanical actuators: fail-hard (FH), short circuit (SC) and open circuit (OC). The fail-hard is a failure condition when the motor shaft of the actuator becomes immovable, whereas the short circuit and open circuit are failures that occur in the electrical parts of the actuator which correspond to zero voltage and zero current in the motor respectively. •	The research investigates and develops a thorough understanding of the effect of actuator faults and failure modes on the vehicle behaviour that provides the necessary foundation for the development of the proposed fault-tolerant strategy. •	An effective fault detection and isolation methods for actuator faults through two different approaches is developed; the vehicle model-based approach and the actuator model-based approach. Additionally, the research takes into account the reliability and robustness of the FDI schemes in the presence of sensor failures and parameter uncertainties in the system. •	The research develops the control re-configuration in order to cope with the identified failure mode of the actuator in order to maintain the vehicle stability and desired curving performance...|$|R
