5|$|Of the graduating {{classes at}} Hunter, 83% {{went on to}} {{specialized}} schools to train as yeomen; radiomen; storekeepers, and cooks and bakers. In addition to the college campuses, enlisted WAVES also trained at Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville; Burdett College in Boston, and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The Bureaus of Aeronautics and Medicine opened their doors to enlisted WAVES. The training in aeronautics took place at naval air stations and training centers; the training for medical technicians {{was held at the}} National Medical and Great Lakes Training Centers. Unlike the training on the college campuses, the training <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>facilities</b> was coeducational.|$|E
5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} {{take place in the}} wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>facilities</b> have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E
5|$|Susianna Kentikian {{was born}} in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, the {{daughter}} of veterinary doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi. At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the violence <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>facilities</b> and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to school {{for a short period of}} time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E

25|$|One recent {{theory about}} bed bug reappearance in the US {{is that they}} never truly disappeared, but may {{have been forced to}} {{alternative}} hosts. Consistent with this is the finding that bed bug DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in Arkansas. Poultry workers <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>facilities</b> may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.|$|E
25|$|Following the invasion, the Japanese {{established}} a large base at Rabaul. The facilities {{located near the}} town were attacked by Allied air units from early 1942, but these operations were generally unsuccessful. By mid-1943 a network of four airfields had been constructed at Rabaul which could accommodate 265 fighters and 166 bombers in protective revetments. Further aircraft could also be accommodated in unprotected parking areas. Aircraft based <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>facilities</b> operated against Allied forces in New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The town was also developed into a major port, with extensive dock and ship repair facilities. Large stockpiles of supplies were stored in warehouses and open air dumps in and around Rabaul. Few other Japanese facilities were constructed on New Britain, though a forward airfield was developed at Gasmata on the island's south coast. Both the Japanese and Australians maintained small parties of coastwatchers at other locations on New Britain; the Australians were civilians who had volunteered {{to remain on the}} island following the invasion.|$|E

500|$|Following their two-months of training, the midshipmen were {{commissioned}} as ensigns or lieutenants (junior grade) in the U.S. naval reserve. The school closed in December 1944, after accepting 10,181 women and graduating 9,477 of them. It also trained 203 SPARS and 295 {{women of the}} United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. Many of these commissioned officers were sent to specialized schools for training in communications, supply, the Japanese language, meteorology, and engineering. The courses of study were held on the college campuses of Mount Holyoke College; Harvard University; University of Colorado; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California; and the University of Chicago. [...] The Bureau of Ordinance also opened its schools to WAVE officers, where some of them studied aviation ordinance. Other officers attended the Naval Technical Training Command School, while others trained to become aviation instructors.

2500|$|Ag-gag is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a class of anti-whistleblower laws that apply within the agriculture industry.
