5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different <b>adjuvants,</b> antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer.

Methods We included 120 patients with EHBTC who underwent radical resection and then received <b>adjuvant</b> CCRT with or without further <b>adjuvant</b> chemotherapy between 2000 and 2006 at Seoul National University Hospital.

25|$|The use {{of simple}} {{molecules}} such as toxoids for immunization tends {{to produce a}} low response by the immune system, and thus poor immune memory. However, adding certain substances to the mixture, for example adsorbing tetanus toxoid onto alum, greatly enhances the immune response (see Roitt etc. below). These substances are known as <b>adjuvants.</b> Several different <b>adjuvants</b> {{have been used in}} vaccine preparation. <b>Adjuvants</b> are also used in other ways in researching the immune system.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{inducing}} dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates or short peptides (small parts of protein {{that correspond to}} the protein antigens on cancer cells).

However, <b>adjuvant</b> {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) efficacy and the optimal <b>adjuvant</b> treatment are unclear. Patients and MethodsThe clinical records of patients tested for EGFR mutation after complete NSCLC resection were reviewed and tested for significance; EGFR mutation and <b>adjuvant</b> therapy effects on survival were assessed using univariate and Cox regression analyses. ResultsWe enrolled 257 patients (stage I, 126; stage II-IIIa, 131); 138 had EGFR mutation. EGFR mutation status was unrelated to recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 572 - 1. 204; PÂ =. 326) or death (HR, 0. 679; 95 % CI, 0. 406 - 1. 136; PÂ =. 14).

25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45â€“90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90â€“180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4â€“18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with <b>adjuvants</b> (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive.
