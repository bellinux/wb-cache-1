2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream valve mechanism. In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the regulator body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure. This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E
5000|$|The Hackworth {{valve gear}} is a design of valve gear used to {{regulate}} the flow of steam to the pistons in steam engines. It is a radial gear, with an <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> driven from the crank. The drive may be taken directly from the crank (top picture) or indirectly via a return crank (lower picture). The {{other end of the}} <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> is attached to a die block which slides in a slotted link. When the link is vertical, the engine is in mid-gear. Forward, reverse and cut-off adjustments are made by moving the link away from the vertical. The valve rod is pivoted to a point on the <b>actuating</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|The TR6 and TR6R were renamed Tiger for 1969, {{leaving the}} TR6C model with the Trophy name. The front brake used a {{modified}} <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> to avoid snagging {{of the cable}} on the front mudguard. Other changes included the larger RM21 alternator and twin Windtone horns. The signature parcel grid was finally dropped for all models.|$|E

5000|$|The Canonflex was {{introduced}} in May, 1959 by Canon of Tokyo, Japan. It is Canon's first 35 mm single-lens reflex camera. Its standard lens is the Super-Canomatic R 50mm 1.8, using {{the first version of}} Canon's breech-lock manual-focus lens mount, which would evolve into the Canon FL and Canon FD lens mounts over the next three decades. The Super-Canomatic lens features fully automatic aperture operation, using two internal connections. [...] Canomatic and R-series lenses use semi-automatic or manual diaphragms. Though the breech-lock mount itself remained unchanged until the introduction of the EF lenses for EOS autofocus cameras in the late 1980s, the <b>actuating</b> <b>levers</b> of the Canomatic or R-series lenses operate differently from their FL and FD descendants.|$|R
5000|$|The R32 had a {{tubular steel}} frame with twin downtubes that {{continued}} under {{the engine to}} the rear wheel. [...] The front fork had a trailing link design suspended by a leaf spring, similar to the forks used by Indian at the time. [...] The rear wheel was rigidly mounted. In the original First Series, Braking was accomplished solely with a [...] "dummy rim" [...] on the rear wheel with two padded brake shoes set within it. One would be operated by the, now traditional, right hand lever and the other by use of a heel <b>actuated</b> <b>lever</b> on the right side. Later years would reroute the front right lever and cable to a front drum brake.|$|R
5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an <b>actuating</b> <b>lever.</b> When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|E
5000|$|Swirl flaps {{are small}} {{butterfly}} valves fitted to the intake manifold {{just before the}} cylinder head intake ports of many modern automotive diesel engines, including those from Audi, BMW, Vauxhall and Alfa Romeo. The flaps are smaller than the intake runners and therefore allow air to pass around them even when [...] "closed". The photo shows a cleaned swirl flap removed from the intake manifold of a BMW M47TU 2-litre diesel engine. The flap itself is made from stainless steel and secured to a spindle by two small Torx screws. The sealing O-ring and external <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> can be seen below the flap itself.|$|E
50|$|The Mylonas Rifle, usually {{referred}} as the M1872 Greek Mylonas is a Greek-designed falling block black powder rifle. It {{was designed and}} developed in 1872 by Greek Artillery Major Efstathios Mylonas (Ευστάθιος Μυλωνάς), while working in the Athens technical facility of the Greek Military Material Authority ("Eforeia Ylikou Polemou", EYP). The 11-mm caliber rifle was a modification of the M1870 Belgian Comblain but with a larger protruding hammer and uniquely styled <b>actuating</b> <b>lever.</b> It {{was adopted by the}} Greek Army and, as there was no facility in the country able to produce quantities with the required rate, its construction was ordered to Emile et Leon Nagant of Liege, Belgium. Thus, only the prototype was built in Greece. The Mylonas was shortly replaced by the M1874 French Gras rifle considered superior by the Greek Army. The Gras used the same chambering as the Mylonas, though it was introduced two years later, leading to speculation that the Gras's cartridge was based on the Mylonas's. The Mylonas rifle was used during the Thessaly campaign of 1878 and as a reserve in later conflicts, while some equipped police units. Due to its early replacement, a total of only approximately 8500 were built. Today Mylonas rifles are considered collectible items.|$|E
50|$|His final work of Cybernetic Art was The Bandit, {{which was}} {{exhibited}} at the Computer Arts Society exhibition at the Edinburgh Festival, UK in 1973. It was a hydraulically <b>actuated</b> <b>lever</b> controlled by a computer and had two modes: one where it was position controlled and one where it was force controlled. When a visitor first held onto the lever, it was force controlled, with a demand value of zero. The person could thus move the arm as he/she pleased. The computer system recorded the series of motions, then switched to position control mode, where it played the series of positions back to the person. The way the person reacted to {{the motion of the}} arm was statistically analysed and the computer program printed out its classification of the gender and temperament of the person.|$|R

50|$|Micro {{switches}} {{are very}} widely used; among their applications are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops {{and many other}} places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, air flow. Micro switches may be directly operated by a mechanism, or may be packaged {{as part of a}} pressure, flow, or temperature switch, operated by a sensing mechanism such as a Bourdon tube. In these latter applications, the repeatability of the actuator position when switching happens is essential for long-term accuracy. A motor driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more micro switches form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including <b>actuating</b> <b>levers,</b> plungers or rollers, forming a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the dual}} {{actuation}} {{of the control}} lever, [...] "...the wing and the tailplane can be moved so as to cause the machine to {{move up and down}} {{while at the same time}} moving to the one side or the other, that is to say that by simply moving the hand which <b>actuates</b> the <b>lever</b> in any desired direction and the trim altered." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of accomplishing work in extravehicular activity (EVA) is well documented. It arises {{as a result}} of motion constraints imposed by a pressurized spacesuit in a near-vacuum and of the frictionless environment induced in microgravity. The appropriate placement of foot restraints is crucial to ensuring that astronauts can remove and drive bolts, mate and demate connectors, and <b>actuate</b> <b>levers.</b> The location on structural members of the foot restraint sockets, to which the portable foot restraint is attached, must provide for an orientation of the restraint that affords the astronaut adequate visual and reach envelopes. Previously, the initial location of these sockets was dependent upon the experienced designer's ability to estimate placement. The design was tested in a simulated zero-gravity environment; spacesuited astronauts performed the tasks with mockups while submerged in water. Crew evaluation of the tasks based on these designs often indicated the bolt or other structure to which force needed to be applied was not within an acceptable work envelope, resulting in redesign. The development of improved methods for location of crew aids prior to testing would result in savings to the design effort for EVA hardware. Such an effort to streamline EVA design is especially relevant to International Space Station construction and maintenance. Assembly operations alone are expected to require in excess of four hundred hours of EVA. Thus, techniques which conserve design resources for assembly missions can have significant impact. We describe an effort to implement a human modelling application in the design effort for an International Space Station Assembly Mission. On Assembly Flight 6 A, the Canadian-built Space Station Remote Manipulator System will be delivered to the U. S. Laboratory. It will be released from its launch restraints by astronauts in EVA. The design of the placement of foot restraint sockets was carried out using the human model Jack, and the modelling results were compared with actual underwater test results. The predicted locations of the sockets was found to be acceptable for 94 % of the tasks attempted by the astronauts, This effort provides confidence in the capabilities of this package to accurately model tasks. It therefore increases assurance that the tool maybe used early in the design process...|$|R
50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} use {{a mechanical}} clutch to transmit torque, {{rather than a}} torque converter, thus avoiding {{the primary source of}} loss in an automatic transmission. Manual transmissions also avoid the power requirement of the hydraulic control system, by relying on the human muscle power of the vehicle operator to disengage the clutch and <b>actuate</b> the gear <b>levers,</b> and the mental power of the operator to make appropriate gear ratio selections. Thus the manual transmission requires very little engine power to function, with the main power consumption due to drag from the gear train being immersed in the lubricating oil of the gearbox.|$|R
