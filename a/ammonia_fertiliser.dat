40|$|In partial {{fulfilment}} of the National Diploma in Horticulture of the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of anhydrous and aqua ammonia as nitrogenous fertilisers, with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These nitrogenous fertilisers, with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in nitrogenous fertilisers and usage of the various forms, particularly anhydrous and aqua ammonia. Also dealt with is the history of nitrogenous fertilisers. Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that anhydrous and aqua ammonia fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas. Part III deals with the position in New Zealand. The types of nitrogen fertilisers used and the economic aspects of their usage. Prospects for anhydrous and aqua ammonia in New Zealand are looked at. In conclusion the general findings are summarised and recommendations are made with a view to future needs in New Zealand for anhydrous and aqua ammonia. This thesis attempts to tentatively answer the question, "Is there a place for anhydrous and aqua <b>ammonia</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in New Zealand, and what action should be taken to examine this subject more closely"...|$|E

50|$|The Chemical Industry was {{established}} at Billingham in 1918 by the Government {{for the production}} of synthetic ammonia. It was intended for use in the making of munitions for the Great War. The 700 acre Grange Farm at Billingham was chosen for the site. The war was over by the time the plant opened and it had to be adapted to new manufacturing. It was taken over by Brunner Mond in 1920 and manufactured synthetic <b>ammonia</b> and <b>fertilisers.</b> Brunner Mond merged with other large scale chemical manufacturers in 1926 to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). In 1928 anhydrite was mined from 700 feet below Billingham for use in the making of sulphuric acid which is required to make detergents and fertilizers.|$|R

This proved to be a much cheaper way to produce ethylene, aromatics, petroleum derivatives and other chemicals such as ammonia on Teesside. From 1964 to 1969 four great oil refineries were erected {{at the mouth of the}} Tees, two by Phillips Petroleum and one each by ICI and Shell. Their main purpose was to supply the Billingham chemical industry. A 138 mi pipeline was built in 1968 linking chemical works on Teesside with chemical plants at Runcorn for the transport of ethylene. Today the remaining oil refinery is operated by ConocoPhillips and two biorefineries, producing biodiesel and bioethanol for transport fuels, are operated by Ensus and Harvest Energy. SABIC operate the ethylene cracker and the aromatics plants, while the <b>ammonia</b> and <b>fertiliser</b> works are operated by CF Fertilisers.|$|R
5000|$|... “Turning {{away from}} coke” and {{replacing}} {{it in the first}} phase with natural gas became one of the main directions of the modernisation of production. The localisation of the factory in the territory through which the south main gas conduit east - west ran made such decision obvious. Azoty, located nearest to the natural gas deposits among all largest recipients, had good conditions to exploit this material. The program of intensification of the production of <b>ammonia</b> and <b>fertilisers,</b> also named “Tarnów I”, was performed in steps. The initial aim was the reconstruction of the ammonia plant to reach the capacity of 480 tons per day by further development of two new gas generators for ammonia synthesis out of coke and two generators producing gas for ammonia synthesis on the basis of natural gas, construction of installations for natural gas conversion, modernisation of gas purification for ammonia synthesis out of carbon oxide by implementation of a so-called copper washing method. In the scope of expansion of productive capacities of nitric acid, five new units for technological nitric acid with pressure method designed in cooperation with T. Hobler (so-called Hydro-Nitro-Hobler) were commissioned, the second unit for nitric acid with non-pressure method was built, and, then, the installation for nitric acid condensed to 110 tons per day and nitrous vitriols to 180 tons per day was intensified.|$|R
30|$|In soil-water {{drainage}} studies, losses {{measured in}} the lower root zone have ranged from 0 - 91  kg N ha- 1 (0 - 45 % of N applied) (Table  1). The highest losses were recorded on coastal sands in the Manawatu region (91  kg N ha- 1) and Canterbury (54  kg N ha- 1) (45 and 36 % of N applied, respectively). Reduced losses (26 - 45  kg N ha- 1, 6 - 10 % of N applied) were recorded in the different harvesting treatments on coastal sand at Woodhill Forest, Auckland (Smith et al. 1994), possibly because N was applied {{on a number of}} occasions over a period of 2 - 3  years. However Smith et al. (1994) did not measure ammonium-N concentrations, and leaching losses may have been underestimated as ammonium-N leaching may occur following fertiliser application on sands (Thomas and Mead 1992). In an earlier study on coastal sand at Woodhill Forest (not shown in Table  1 because of the length of time between fertiliser application and measurement), Baker et al. (1986) found no difference in N leaching between fertilised (a total of 960  kg ha- 1  N over ten years) and unfertilised plots. The comparison was made 14  years after the initial N application and, although drainage losses at the time of measurement were low (< 0.2  kg N ha- 1  yr- 1; Additional file 1 : Table S 3), significant losses in the period since fertiliser was applied were indicated. For example, in fertiliser-treated plots, 340  kg N ha- 1 of the N additions were unaccounted for in biomass (exclusive of roots) and soil N to a depth of 1  m. A proportion of the unaccounted for N would have been contained in root biomass and some may have been lost through volatilisation of <b>ammonia</b> after <b>fertiliser</b> application, but most is likely to have been lost through leaching. Losses from the lower root zone at non-coastal sand sites listed in Table  1 amounted to 0 - 28  N kg ha- 1 (0 - 14 % of the N applied).|$|R
40|$|Grassland {{management}} {{may lead}} to strong modification of the canopy structure and hence fluxes of carbon and nitrogen in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Mowing or grazing removes green leaves, which are often a sink for ammonia. Consequently, the ratio between actively growing leaves and senescing/dead parts of the plants is strongly changed in favour of the latter, which may constitute a large source of <b>ammonia.</b> Moreover, <b>fertilisers</b> are a known source of ammonia through direct volatilisation. The effects of grassland management, e. g. growing, cutting and fertilisation, on ammonia emission were investigated using a dynamic chamber. This technique {{made it possible to}} monitor ammonia emissions in the field at the plant level. With ammonia-free air at the inlet, the ammonia emissions from mature sward did not exceed 4 ng NH 3 m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 . They were approximately 20 times larger above a sward re-growing after cutting and 200 times larger after fertilisation, where 0. 5 – 1. 0 % of the applied inorganic nitrogen fertiliser was lost by volatilisation. Cutting implied three main changes in ammonia sources and sinks within the canopy: (i) physiological changes with nitrogen remobilisation to the growing leaves and increase in senescence, (ii) changes in compartment proportions with only 5 % of green leaves remaining after cutting as opposed to equal proportions of dead leaves as green leaves before cutting, (iii) microclimate changes within the canopy especially for litter with higher turbulence, temperature, and alternation of dry (day) and wet (night) conditions after cutting. These changes promoted ammonia volatilisation from the litter, which could account for the increased ammonia loss following cutting. Another potential source was the wounded surfaces of the stubble which may have emitted ammonia during bleeding and evaporation of sap containing significant levels of ammonium. These results showed that the contribution of litter and drying cut sward on the ammonia balance of grassland is very significant, as well as their interaction with microclimatic conditions. This could apply to most natural and managed ecosystems and could be especially significant in the former. Consequently, further studies on ammonia fluxes should have a 0 focus on this part of the canopy...|$|R
40|$|Industrial mega-sites are characterised by the {{multiplicity}} and the generally complex succession of industrial activities. Consequently, {{the history of}} contamination, not always well documented, induces a succession or superposition of contaminant sources and contamination pathways. Assessment of the contamination of the different reservoirs (soil, surface water, groundwater, biota) at a given moment and the related risks for their present and future use {{as well as the}} conception of remediation strategies requires indications on both the origin and the timeline of contamination processes in order to foresee their release and propagation in the receptor milieus. Isotope fingerprinting and groundwater dating increase our ability of disentangling the chronology of multiple contaminations; the large choice of isotopic tools offers the possibility of selecting specific direct or indirect tracers of most inorganic or organic contaminants. Here we present results from an industrial area in Northern France, a former coal mining area, where the first coking plant was installed in 1897. Over the following century, a large diversity of coal-based chemical industries developed on this site, including the treatment of coke oven gas, ammonia and PVC production. Coking activities ceased in 1986, the present day production concerns <b>ammonia</b> water, <b>fertilisers</b> and PVC. Over time, several decantation basins were constructed and two settling zones representing potential contamination pathways for groundwater in the Upper Cretaceous chalk aquifer, partly overlain by Tertiary to Pleistocene sediments and modern alluvial deposits. Main contaminants are cyanides, arsenic, nitrate, ammonium and sulphate, found mainly in groundwater but also, to a lesser extent, in surface waters downstream of the site To complete a comprehensive chemical monitoring programme, a multi-isotope and groundwater dating study was conducted combining delta 15 N and delta 18 O of nitrate, delta 34 S and delta 18 O of sulphate, stable isotopes of the water molecule and delta 11 B of dissolved boron with CFCs and SF 6 as indicators of groundwater residence times. For part of the contaminated groundwaters, mean CFC-derived residence times exceed 30 years so that the contamination can be qualified as historical. A rough anticorrelation of SF 6 with total cyanide and arsenic points to the same conclusion. Arsenic concentrations are not clearly correlated with any major compound or isotope tracer. Nitrate contents are related to ammonium and fertiliser production [1] and are partly limited by denitrification processes induced by the release of organic compounds by the industrial processes. delta 34 S values of sulphate around 0 ‰ vs. CDT are compatible with hydrolysis and oxidation of sulphur produced by coal combustion [2], delta 18 O of sulphate indicates variable contribution of atmospheric oxygen and water depending on the reaction mechanism (hydrolysis-oxidation, or oxidation-hydrolysis, [3]). Boron concentrations and isotope signatures of most groundwaters {{in the vicinity of the}} industrial site and immediately downstream do not significantly differ from upstream baseline values. Boron appears rather as a tracer of groundwater-surface water mixing processes than as co-tracer of the industrial contaminations. Stable isotopes of the water molecule show clear signs of evaporation for the highly contaminated groundwater below the site and directly downstream which indicate a strong impact of decantation basins as vector of contamination...|$|R
40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{epidemiological study}} was to investigate possible associations between occupational exposure, respiratory symptoms and change in lung function among employees at a mineral fertiliser production plant. Material and methods Lung function indices (forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and lung diffusing capacity (DLCO)) were measured in 2007 and 2010 among employees at a fertiliser production plant. In 2007, 349 persons participated (86 % of those eligible). Of the 283 participants remaining at work three years later, 6 % did not participate in the second phase of lung function measurement. In addition to those participating in 2007, 34 additional employees participated in 2010, for a total of 383 participants. The employees consented to spirometry test and diffusing capacity test and answered a respiratory symptoms questionnaire during each testing session. In 2007, rhinometry was performed {{at the same time as}} the lung function testing. In 2010, the subjects at the plant answered a questionnaire on work history with an emphasis on the three-year follow-up period. The employees were classified in job groups by production department according to their principal affiliation during follow-up. Study participants tested only once were grouped in the department they served on the day of lung function testing. Employees in the administration or working in average less than 2 hours/week in the production were assigned to the job-group “Other”. The exposure assessment was performed in 2007 - 08 in all the departments at the plant; ammonia, nitric acid, compound fertiliser, and calcium nitrate departments, as well as a shipping area. A total of 178 inhalable and 179 thoracic personal aerosol mass fraction samples were collected from randomly chosen workers (N= 141), whereof 23 % of the workers participated more than once. Masses of inhalable and thoracic aerosol fractions were measured gravimetrically. Water-soluble and water-insoluble aerosol fractions were analysed for the major constituents, Ca, K, Mg, and P. Concentrations of F-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -and SO 42 - in the water-soluble aerosol fraction and leachates from impregnated gas filter-pads were analysed. NH 3, CO, and NO 2 were measured using direct-reading electrochemical sensors. In addition, a sub study on exposure assessment using video exposure monitoring strategy was conducted during a week in May 2009 to identify short-term peak episodes. Results An adjusted, statistically significant decline in FEV 1 of 18 mL/year during the followup was found for the total group, but no significant decline in FVC. The workers in the nitric acid department had a statistically significant decline in FEV 1, but the absolute decline was of the same magnitude as for those in the <b>Ammonia</b> and Compound <b>fertiliser</b> A departments. DLCO showed a statistically significant decline of 0. 068 mmol/min/kPa/year for the total group. The prevalence of selected self-reported respiratory symptoms; morning cough, cough with phlegm, cough with phlegm > 3 months/yr, and wheezing, varied between 6. 5 to 26. 2 %, with only morning cough showing a statistical significant increase from 8. 0 % in 2007 to 13. 7 % in 2010. No association was found between respiratory symptoms and the decline in lung function indices, and borderline significant correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The median inhalable and thoracic aerosol mass concentration exposure levels were 1. 1 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 93 - 45) and 0. 21 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 085 - 11), respectively. The highest median aerosol mass concentrations were found in the compound fertiliser departments with median inhalable mass air concentration of 3. 0 mg/m 3 in Compound fertiliser C and median thoracic mass air concentration of 0. 78 mg/m 3 in Compound fertiliser A. The median air concentrations of CO, NH 3, and NO 2 in all departments were predominantly below the limit of detection (2 ppm, 3 ppm, 0. 2 ppm, respectively). However, some short-term peak episodes of NH 3 and NO 2 were detected, e. g. when performing tasks like cleaning and sampling for quality control. Conclusion An observed adjusted decline in lung function indices was found in this three-year follow-up of workers at a nitrate fertiliser plant. The prevalence of morning cough increased in the follow-up period, but no association between respiratory symptoms and decline in lung function indices was found. A borderline correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The exposure levels for aerosols and gases were generally low with many measurements below the limit of detection. No plausible exposure related explanation for the overall lung function decline during follow-up was found. List of papers. The papers are removed from the thesis due to publisher restrictions.
