60|$|MAYOR. [With {{his first}} puff] <b>After</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> the Council the other day, Builder, {{we came to}} a decision.|$|E
6000|$|P.S.--I {{walked to}} Linton the day <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> us, and {{returned}} on Saturday. I walked in one day, and returned in one.[3] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Half-an-hour ago. She {{was taken}} ill {{yesterday}} morning immediately <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> her. She is insensible, {{but you may}} find her still living.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. <b>After</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> me {{last night}} he came to my study with a malicious--er--fabrication {{respecting}} yourself which I need not--ah--particularize.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Patrick {{thought you}} might have found the letter," [...] she said, [...] "and might not have remembered about it again until <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> the inn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One minute," [...] said Frau Meyer. [...] "Which {{of the two}} hotels {{here are}} you staying at? I want to send you {{something}} to read to-night, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> have <b>left</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] says he, presently, [...] "he was shot--shot by accident--when {{we first}} came aboard of this here craft <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The postman {{came this}} morning the minute <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> the house. There was only one letter for you, and I have it here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. About {{a quarter}} of an hour <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> Jeeves went searching about and found the {{back-door}} key on the kitchen window-sill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know you}} had to work <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> the office," [...] said Katharine, in a tone which gave the {{impression}} that {{she was thinking of}} something else, as was, indeed, the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "You struck me," [...] she rejoined, [...] "as a {{man with}} a plot in his head. You looked as if you were bent on some {{sinister}} errand, and <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> me I wondered whether I ought to have let you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly what I {{have told}} you," [...] said Newman. [...] "A paper written by your husband <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> him for dead, {{and during the}} couple of hours before you returned. You see he had the time; you shouldn't have stayed away so long. It {{declares}} distinctly his wife's murderous intent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to my sitting-room, Jack," [...] she said, [...] "and have {{something}} to eat and drink, and tell me your adventures <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> Wurzburg." ...|$|E
60|$|HAKE A {{messenger}} {{came for}} him soon <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left,</b> ma'am. I {{was to tell}} you he would most likely be dining at the House.|$|E
60|$|According {{to request}} I will {{endeavor}} {{to keep you}} informed of all our goings on <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left,</b> up {{to the time of}} our departure for Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{did have}} some sort of an understanding, Tom. But you know how it was with you and Nellie--Mrs. Laning wouldn't think of your {{becoming}} publicly engaged until <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> college. She has told Grace that she will have to wait. So she is free to do as she chooses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is gone; all gone," [...] she said, {{shaking her}} head,--"gone from me because I {{have been so}} easily deserted; gone from you because the change has been so easy to you. How long was it, Frank, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> me before <b>you</b> were basking happily in the smiles of Lady Mary Palliser?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were married}} {{within a week}} <b>after</b> we <b>left</b> <b>you,</b> and Master Cap {{departed}} next day. You have forgotten to inquire about your friend Saltwater." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gilbert is very ill," [...] said Mrs. Lynde gravely. [...] "He {{took down}} with typhoid fever just <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> for Echo Lodge. Did you never hear of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indian moccasins!" [...] exclaimed Dan. [...] "Ralph, {{you were}} right about that Indian. He was {{watching}} you, and <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> the deer {{he came in and}} took possession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{you have}} not been {{informed}} of what happened <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> Venice?' Agnes ventured to add. 'Ferrari left the palace secretly; and he has never been heard of since.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Her father fell back, as {{they entered}} the hotel door, and murmured to Lanfear: [...] "Will you wait till I come down?" ... "I wanted to tell you about my daughter," [...] he explained, when he came back after the quarter of an hour which Lanfear had found rather intense. [...] "It's useless to pretend you wouldn't have noticed--Had nobody been with <b>you</b> <b>after</b> I <b>left</b> <b>you,</b> down there?" [...] He twisted his head in the {{direction}} of the pavilion, where they had been breakfasting.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} mind what the Sirdar said, Hilliard. It {{was a very}} noble action, and did you credit, and I {{can assure you that}} that was the opinion of all who knew you; but to the Sirdar, you know, duty is everything, and I think you are lucky in not being sent down, at once, to the base. However, he said to me, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> him: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is she?" [...] she asked, {{her voice}} trembling. [...] "Muviri {{told me that}} she disobeyed your {{instructions}} and ran off into the jungle <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> them. Oh, John, I cannot bear to lose her, too!" [...] And Lady Greystoke broke down and wept, as she pillowed her head upon the broad breast where so often before she had found comfort in the great tragedies of her life.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Margaret Hilditch speaking," [...] she announced. [...] "I {{felt that}} I must ring {{up and tell}} you of a very strange thing which {{happened}} <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is sweet," [...] she said. She asked curiously: [...] "What {{did you do}} last night, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> me? I can't guess, though I daresay you {{can guess}} what I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We put the binder in yesterday," [...] {{answered}} Farquhar. [...] "I'd {{have done}} it earlier only that I sent Pete over to Thorne's place {{for a few days}} <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} sacrilege for others," [...] Chigron replied, [...] "but not to us, whose {{business}} and duty {{it is to}} handle the dead. I can replace the mummies in their cases <b>after</b> <b>you</b> have <b>left,</b> {{and they will be}} none the worse for their temporary removal. It will be necessary, of course, {{that there should be no}} signs of habitation in the cave--nothing to excite their suspicions that it has been disturbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Silver, [...] "as {{between man}} and man, that's too much and too little. What you're <b>after,</b> why <b>you</b> <b>left</b> the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't {{tell me what you}} mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, madam; {{if it is}} to {{be called}} stubbornness, I must be stubborn. My lord, Mrs. Proudie spoke to me on this subject in the breakfast-room <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> it, and I then ventured to explain to her that in {{accordance}} with such light as I have on the matter, I could not discuss it in her presence. I greatly grieve that I failed to make myself understood by her,--as, otherwise, this unpleasantness might have been spared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim, a while back, I reckon {{some years}} though <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> home, was foreman for Hardman's outfit. An' {{he went to}} Marco first. Reckon Hardman sent him up there to scout around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, tell you, old hoss. Schoenstrom got so darn lonely <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left,</b> {{and when}} Ben and Heinie got your address {{and bought the}} garage, think's I, lez go off on a little bum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That we can see, father. Mother and I were at {{the window}} for hours <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>left,</b> and the whole sky seemed ablaze. Do {{you think that there}} is any danger of its coming here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, though I cannot doubt your sincere {{interest}} in the young lady's welfare, I don't like your mysterious way of showing it. In the second place, when I called at your address in London, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> my house, I found that you had taken to flight. I place my own interpretation on this circumstance; but as it is not founded on any knowledge of facts, I merely allude to it, and say no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame Pratolungo shared {{your hard}} opinion of me, on that occasion," [...] he proceeded; [...] "and {{expressed}} it in infinitely stronger terms. She betrayed herself {{to you in}} the rectory garden. She betrayed herself to me, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had <b>left</b> us together in the sitting-room. Her hasty temper again, beyond all doubt! I quite agree with you. What she said to me in your absence, she would never have said if she had been mistress of herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I judge no man this weather,' said Hummil. 'He had a {{touch of}} the sun, I fancy; for last week, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> fellows had <b>left,</b> he came into the {{verandah}} and {{told me that he was}} going home to see his wife, in Market Street, Liverpool, that evening.|$|R
