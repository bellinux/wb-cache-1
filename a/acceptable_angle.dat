MATERIAL AND METHODS: The nasofacial angle of an idealized silhouette male Caucasian/white profile image was altered incrementally between 21 ° and 48 °. Images were rated on a Likert scale by pretreatment patients (n = 75), laypersons (n = 75), and clinicians (n = 35). RESULTS: A nasofacial angle of approximately 30 ° was deemed to be ideal, with a range of 27 °- 36 ° deemed <b>acceptable.</b> <b>Angles</b> above or below this range were perceived as unattractive. Angles outside the range of 21 °- 42 ° were deemed very unattractive. Excessive nasal prominence (nasofrontal angle of 48 °) was deemed the least attractive.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{quantitative}} evaluation {{of the influence of}} the lower component of the nasofrontal angle on perceived attractiveness and threshold values of desire for rhinoplasty. The nasofrontal angle of an idealized silhouette male Caucasian profile image was altered incrementally between 106 and 148 degrees. Images were rated on a Likert scale by pretreatment patients (n[*]=[*] 75), laypeople (n[*]=[*] 75), and clinicians (n[*]=[*] 35). The results demonstrated that a nasofrontal angle of approximately 130 degrees is ideal, corresponding to a lower component of 60 degrees, with a range of 127 to 142 degrees deemed <b>acceptable.</b> <b>Angles</b> above or below this range are perceived as unattractive, and anything outside the range of 118 to 145 degrees is deemed very unattractive. Reduced nasofrontal angles, simulating a nasal hump deformity, of less than 115 degrees were deemed the least attractive. In terms of threshold values of desire for surgery, for all groups a threshold value of 148 degrees indicated a preference for surgery: for patients, the threshold value was 121 degrees or less; for lay people, the threshold value was 124 degrees or less; and similarly for clinicians, the threshold value was 118 degrees or less. Clinicians were the least critical, and patients appeared to be less critical than lay people. This stresses the importance of using patients as observers, as well as laypeople and clinicians, in facial attractiveness research.

40|$|The {{structure}} and IR spectrum of AlPO 4 - 8, the 18 -ring aluminophosphate VPI- 5, and related structures were simulated using atomistic potentials and a generalized valence force field. The various topologies theor. {{possible for the}} VPI- 5 structure indicate that hexagonal prisms and cubes in the structure increase its lattice energy, thus decreasing the plausibility of the structure. This {{is not the only}} energy-detg. feature; the relative orientation of neighboring tetrahedra also has an effect. The calcd. differences in lattice energy between the 14 -ring structure AlPO 4 - 8, the 18 -ring structure VPI- 5, and a hypothetical 24 -ring structure are mainly due to d. differences; no direct effect of the ring size on the lattice energy was obsd. Both VPI- 5 and AlPO 4 - 8 show a shift of layers when their lattice energy is minimized by optimizing the crystallog. coordinates and unit cell parameters. The hypothetical 24 -ring structure does not show such a shift. This is probably due to the flexibility of the 24 -rings that can completely accommodate strains in the initial structure. This is also indicated by the large loss of symmetry of the structure. The simulated IR spectra reproduce essential differences between the exptl. spectra of AlPO 4 - 8 and VPI- 5. The highest frequency modes, however, are too high. Spectra calcd. with the structures obtained by lattice energy minimization agree better with expt. than those calcd. with exptl. structures.

40|$|The central {{thesis of}} this paper is that the dynamic {{performance}} of machinery can be improved dramatically in certain cases through a systematic and meticulous evolutionary algorithm search through the space of all structural geometries permitted by manufacturing, cost and functional constraints. This is a cheap and elegant approach in scenarios where employing active control elements is impractical for reasons of cost and complexity. From an optimization perspective the challenge lies in the efficient, yet thorough global exploration of the multi-dimensional and multi-modal design spaces often yielded by such problems. Morevoer, the designs are often defined by a mixture of continuous and discrete variables - a task that evolutionary algorithms appear to be ideally suited for. In this article we discuss the specific case of the optimization of crop spraying machinery for improved uniformity of spray deposition, subject to structural weight and manufacturing constraints. Using a mixed variable evolutionary algorithm allowed us to optimize both shape and topology. Through this process we have managed to reduce the maximum roll angle of the sprayer by an order of magnitude, whilst allowing only relatively inexpensive changes to the baseline design. Further (though less dramatic) improvements were shown to be possible when we relaxed the cost constraint. We applied the same approach to the inverse problem of reducing the mass while maintaining an <b>acceptable</b> roll <b>angle</b> - a 2 % improvement proved possible in this cas...|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} systematical and {{analytical}} study of lepton mixing {{which can be}} derived from the subgroups of SU(3) under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. We find that type D groups can predict lepton mixing patterns compatible with the experimental data at 3 σ level. The lepton mixing matrix turns out to be of the trimaximal form, and the Dirac CP violating phase is trivial. Moreover, we extend the flavor symmetry to the quark sector. The Cabibbo mixing between the first two generations of quarks can be generated by type D groups. Since all the finite subgroups of U(3) which are not the subgroups of SU(3) have not been classified, an exhaustive scan over all finite discrete groups up to order 2000 is performed {{with the help of the}} computer algebra system GAP. We find that only 90 (10) groups for Dirac (Majorana) neutrinos can generate the lepton mixing angles in the experimentally preferred ranges. The lepton mixing matrix is still the trimaximal pattern and the Dirac CP phase remains trivial. The smallest groups which lead to viable mixing angles are [162, 10], [162, 12] and [162, 14]. For quark flavor mixing, the correct order of magnitude of the CKM matrix elements can not be generated. Only the Cabibbo mixing is allowed even if we impose very loose constraints 0. 1 ≤|(V_CKM) _ 12 |≤ 0. 3 and |(V_CKM) _ 13 |≤|(V_CKM) _ 23 |<|(V_CKM) _ 12 |. The group Δ(6 · 7 ^ 2) can predict a Cabibbo angle θ_q=π/ 14 in good agreement with the best fit value. The groups which can give rise to both phenomenologically viable lepton mixing <b>angles</b> and <b>acceptable</b> Cabibbo <b>angle</b> are discussed, and the groups Δ(6 · 9 ^ 2), [648, 259], [648, 260], [648, 266] and Δ(6 · 14 ^ 2) are especially promising.

40|$|Ruppert’s {{algorithm}} [6] is {{an elegant}} method for generating size-competitive meshes, but admits a poor worst case run-time. Recent time-efficient Delaunay refinement algorithms [2] rely on bounding the {{the degree of}} each intermediate triangulation and thus ensure that all local operations in the Delaunay triangulation are efficient. We propose a simple alternative to Ruppert’s algorithm which maintains this additional property that the all intermediate triangulations have bounded degree. The algorithm combines three main ideas. First, the yielding procedure of Ruppert’s algorithm is eliminated by instead deleting a nearby circumcenter whenever a midpoint or input point is inserted in the mesh {{in the spirit of}} Chew’s second algorithm [1]. Second, quality of the mesh is maintained before conformity in a similar fashion to the SVR algo-rithm [2]. Finally, the triangles on the priority queue are prioritized by circumradius with the largest simplices processed first. The resulting algorithm produces a conforming Delaunay, size-competitive quality mesh. Additionally, there is an explicit bound on the degree of each triangulation produced by the algorithm which depends only on the minimum <b>angle</b> <b>acceptable</b> for output triangles, denoted κ. The algorithm is simple and can be implemented by making a few changes to Ruppert’s algorithm. ...|$|R
