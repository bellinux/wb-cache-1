Of the three, the GNS/PANI composite shows better performance than CB/PANI and CNT/PANI. This {{can be attributed to}} the following three characteristics of GNSs as the PANI support: (a) the two-dimensional planar structure is beneficial to homogeneous nucleation of a large amount of PANI on their surface, giving more active sites for the redox reaction; (b) the planar contact between GNSs and PANI is good for constructing a conductive network with a high electron transfer rate and a low resistance and (c) the layer-by-layer stacks of crumpled GNSs and PANI layers prevent the peeling of PANI from the graphene surface. As a consequence the material can tolerate severe volume changes, swelling and shrinkage of PANI, during charge/discharge...|$|R

However, <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> can be admixed with a {{carbonaceous}} black pigment in commercial paint preparations (vide infra). Unfortunately, the broad Raman peaks for carbon black at ~ 1325 and 1580  cm− 1 fall under the similarly broad features in the pure <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> reference pigment. Figure  5 c shows a reference mixture of <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> and lamp black in a 4 : 1 ratio prepared as a watercolor paint. Based on the similarity of the three spectra, {{it is possible that}} the poster paint used in the Haku Maki background could be a mixture of both <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> and carbon-based black pigments.|$|E
30|$|<b>Aniline</b> <b>black,</b> {{also known}} as chrome black, is perhaps the {{earliest}} of the synthetic organic pigments, being discovered between 1860 and 1863 [11]. It {{is known for its}} matte finish [12], which Maki uses to contrast with the glossier, high key pigments of the colored subjects. Although <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> is known to have been widely used in the printing and dyeing industries since 1863, it has only before been specifically identified in the cultural heritage literature as an ink in a 1930 s printed book [13]. In that work, Doncea and Ion published a diffuse reflectance infrared spectrum (DRIFTS) for the pigment, but the dependence of the DRIFTS technique on the optical properties of the sample make it insufficient to serve as a general reference for further identifications. It {{should be noted that the}} popular Infrared and Raman Users Group (IRUG) spectral database does not contain a reference spectrum of <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> [14], which may have contributed to the lack of observed occurrences for this historically important pigment. To the authors’ knowledge, the <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> reported here for three of Haku Maki’s “Poem” series prints is the pigment’s first discovery on a work of fine art. The use of <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> has declined since the mid- 1930 s when other synthetic blacks that were safer and easier to apply emerged onto the market [15]. It is worth noting, however, that the pigment is still included in several commercial artists’ paint lines, such as Winsor & Newton’s Designers Gouache Jet Black (# 50947171) and Holbein’s Artists’ Watercolor Tube Peach Black (#W 137 W 337), where it is mixed in the latter with lamp black. As such, it would not be surprising to find other examples of the use of <b>aniline</b> <b>black,</b> even in contemporary artworks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aniline</b> <b>Black</b> {{is perhaps}} the oldest known {{synthetic}} polymer. It has been studied since the mid 19 ᵗʰ century, and is still a matter of interest. These interests arise {{from the fact that}} <b>Aniline</b> <b>Black</b> is inexpensive, yet has some very unusual and potentially useful electrical properties. The present approach has been a systematic study of <b>Aniline</b> <b>Black</b> related compounds. The model compounds were synthesized in a controlled fashion to dictate exact structure and purity. It is expected that the better the process of formation, the more uniform the structure, and hence a more usable material as an organic semiconductor. In the course of this investigation conclusions were drawn as to the structure/function aspects of the derived compounds. Attempts to alter the structure of model compounds deviated from the hypothesized behavior. Starburst model compounds displayed properties unexpected to the investigators. Available information about starburst polymers is very scarce. This work complements previous work on <b>Aniline</b> <b>Black</b> and related compounds, and adds a new source of knowledge in starburst chemistry. The properties of starburst compounds can be predicted only in part from the chemical makeup of the materials; this study gives some of the predictions based on the morphology. Several new approaches to the synthesis of useful <b>Aniline</b> <b>Black</b> model compounds grew from the knowledge obtained during this research. These will be presented with the body of the work and discussed at the conclusion as to the significance of such an investigation...|$|E
30|$|The vibrancy of the {{contrasting}} {{colors in the}} Haku Maki prints {{and the potential for}} lengthy or repeated exhibition raised concerns over the stability of the inks to light. Chrome based pigments are known to darken upon exposure to light, and the lightfastness of <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> is variously reported as either good or questionable. Herbst and Hunger’s authoritative industrial textbook describes the lightfastness of <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> as good in the masstone, but weaker when admixed with titanium white [12]. However, several artists’ websites and watercolor manuals list the pigment in commercial paints as being of only moderate lightfastness or fugitive unless mixed with carbon black [19, 20].

30|$|An {{in-depth}} investigation of Maki’s pigment choices using non-invasive light-based technologies like Raman microspectroscopy facilitated by in situ XRF analysis has identified an extensive palette of luminous pigments. This unprecedented study of his material choices suggests {{the use of}} commercial paints that while similar in color, varied in composition over the years. Of particular note in these colorants are the occurrences of <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> and molybdate orange, which have not been positively identified previously in fine art prints.|$|E
30|$|Pigment {{reference}} samples were acquired {{in order to}} confirm spectral characterizations and to construct model samples of paint mixtures. <b>Aniline</b> <b>black</b> (Paliotol L 0080, PBk 1) was acquired from BASF, chrome yellow medium (PY 34) and toluidine red (PR 3) from Kremer Pigments, and molybdate orange (PR 104) from Rublev. A reference for lamp black (PBk 7) was acquired {{in the form of}} a commercial Winsor & Newton watercolor tube paint. Model paints were prepared by mulling the pure pigment or pigment mixtures with Kremer gum arabic prepared as a thick watercolour paste according to an artist’s recipe [5] and spread to dry on white paper or glass slides.|$|E
30|$|The {{observance}} of these pigments has {{also led to}} {{a study of the}} lightfastness of Maki’s palette using visible light induced accelerated fade testing of an exemplar of his “Poem” series. This lightfastness study identified several inorganic pigments like chrome yellow and molybdate orange that are susceptible to loss of intensity and darkening upon exposure to light and demonstrated somewhat surprisingly the lightfastness of the somewhat fugitive <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> when mixed with a carbonaceous black pigment. These studies highlight the importance of light in the appreciation of these vibrant modern woodblock prints, the utility of light-based analyses in understanding the artist’s material choices, the role of light in the degradation of these same artworks, and the importance of identifying artist’s materials for customizing stewardship practices.|$|E
30|$|Four {{brightly colored}} calligraphic prints from the “Poem” series (1970 / 71) by Japanese artist Haku Maki (1924 – 2000) were {{examined}} using multiple light-based analytical techniques {{in an effort}} to address conservation concerns regarding these artworks. A distracting white haze on the surface of some of the prints was determined by light microscopy and infrared microanalysis to be fungal mycelium from an inactive mold infestation that occurred prior to the artwork’s acquisition by the museum. Pigment analysis by Raman, X-ray fluorescence, and infrared microspectroscopies identified the artist’s palette as containing common printing ink colors such as <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> (PBk 1), carbon black (PBk 7), phthalocyanine blue (PB 15), Prussian blue (PB 27), ultramarine blue (PB 29), molybdate orange (PR 104), chrome yellow (PY 34), barium yellow (PY 31), viridian (PG 17), barium sulphate (PW 21), and synthetic organic red pigments (PR 3, PR 22, PR 48 : 3). Although <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> and molybdate orange are common industrial pigments, reference vibrational spectra to assist in their identification have not appeared previously in the conservation literature. Moreover, this investigation includes to the authors’ knowledge the first published identification of these pigments in a work of fine art. Haku Maki’s unique ‘cement-on-woodblock’ printing technique in combination with his vibrant palette creates dynamic, embossed effects in these prints. However, lightfastness testing using a microfade tester identified the potential for light-based damage to the artwork, in some instances showing poorer lightfastness for colors reported to be stable pigments and greater stability than anticipated for others. These analyses are the first objective study of this innovative artist’s material choices, and they enhance our understanding of his printing technique while helping to determine the proper stewardship protocols to protect his artistic legacy.|$|E
40|$|Polyaniline (PA) and <b>aniline</b> <b>black</b> (AB) were {{prepared}} {{in powder form}} by the chemical method of oxidative polymerization, from which free-standing thin films were obtained by solvent evaporation using N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP). The thin films contained 2, 4, 6 or 8 wt% AB. Electrical measurements showed that the samples containing 4 % AB exhibited the highest photoconductivity of the four concentrations. Thus {{there appears to be}} a critical ratio of PA to AB for maximum photoconductivity. Annealing up to 570 K has little effect on the conductivity. Upon adding a small quantity of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) to the PA + AB, the electrical conductivity increased considerably and the optical absorption was extended from the UV to the near IR. The electrical conductivity mechanism is a consequence of a redox process, since AB is the oxidized state of PA and, upon illumination, there is an exchange of charge carriers. The extension of the range of optical absorption upon addition of CuPc is interpreted to suggest that CuPc photosensitizes the material and enhances the carrier transport process in the redox couple. The activation energy from the temperature-dependent conductivity and the band gap from the electrolyte electroreflectance method were determined. The activation energy for 0. 4 % CuPc is lowest (0. 52 eV) and the corresponding band gap is determined to be 3. 0 eV. This organic compound could be a good candidate for inexpensive, reliable and efficient solar energy converting devices. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

Monomers and derivatives of 4 -[(4 -hydroxyphenyl) azo]- 1 -naphthol 5, and 4, 4 '- [oxybis(p-phenyleneazo) ] bisphenol 6 showed no l. c. behavior. New thermotropic polyesters {{based on these}} multiazobisphenols were synthesized. Sebacates of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 showed l. c. behavior, while polymers based on isophthalic or 5 -t-butylisophthalic acid did not do so. Polyformals were also synthesized from these momoners, only that of 4 showed weak l. c. behavior. The correlation between the structure of these polymers and their tractabilities, electrical properties, liquid crystal behaviors was studied. Polymers and copolymers containing p-azoarylene and p-azoxyarylene groups were synthesized by oxidative coupling of various aromatic diamines. Films were cast directly from the reaction mixtures or from the polymer solution. The films were n-doped by sodium naphthalide or p-doped by iodine. They showed electrical conductivities of 10 ⁻⁴ to 10 ⁻⁵ ohm⁻¹cm⁻¹.
