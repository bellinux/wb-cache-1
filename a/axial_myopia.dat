50|$|This {{technique}} was first practiced by Herman Knapp in 1884. Here, 2% xylocaine is {{introduced into the}} muscle cone behind the eyeball. The injection is usually given through the inferior fornix of {{the skin of the}} outer part of the lower lid when the eye is in primary gaze. The ciliary nerves, ciliary ganglion, oculomotor nerve and abducens nerve are anesthetized in retrobulbar block. As a result, global akinesia, anaesthesia and analgesia are produced. The superior oblique muscle, which is outside the muscle cone, is not usually paralyzed. The complications of retrobulbar block are globe perforation, optic nerve injury, retrobulbar haemorrhage and extraocular muscle palsy. Retrobulbar anaesthesia is contraindicated in posterior staphyloma, high <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> and enopthalmos.|$|E

We conducted this study to evaluate efficacy of single injection percaruncular peribulbar anaesthesia for phacoemulsification in patients with <b>axial</b> <b>myopia.</b> MethodsEighty patients with <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> received percaruncular peribulbar anaesthesia and were evaluated for incidence of major or minor complications. Also surgeon and patients’ satisfaction and their comment on operative conditions were noted. ResultsOf the 80 patients 51 patients had posterior staphylomas. About three quarters of the patients developed adequate akinesia in 10 min. Remaining 25 % received second injection with the same technique but with less volume after which the percent of patients with adequate akinesia rose to 91 %. Adequate analgesia developed in almost all patients and only in one patient, intravenous analgesia was necessary to complete the operation. All operations were completed uneventfully. No perforations or penetrations were recorded and no other major complications were encountered. About 97 % of the surgeons and 96 % of the patients found the operative conditions satisfactory.

40|$|Aim. To reveal early {{glaucoma}} {{diagnostic criteria}} in high-degree <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> {{based on the}} morphometric analysis of the retina and optic nerve. Materials and methods. Standard ophthalmic exam, OCT of the retina and optic nerve as well as macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurements were performed in three cohorts of patients with <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> (normal IOP, glaucoma, ocular hypertension / OHT). In OHT group, the data obtained were analyzed by the parameters for which significant differences between normal IOP and glaucoma cohorts were demonstrated. Results. Significant differences were identified between study (<b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> and OHT) and control group (axial myopia and normal IOP) by the following parameters: 1) IOP measured by pneumotonometry (20. 5 ± 3. 1 vs 13. 3 ± 0. 8  mm Hg, respectively); 2) corneal-compensated IOP estimated by Ehlers based on 5 ‑g Maklakov applanation tonometry (19. 1 ± 2. 8 vs 15. 1 ± 1. 0 mm Hg, respectively); 3) ganglion cell complex and inner plexiform layer thickness in the superior macular region (73. 4 ± 7. 0 vs 81. 0 ± 3. 2 μm, respectively); 4) retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the inferior peripapillary area (99. 6 ± 14. 9 vs 121. 9 ± 9. 4 μm, respectively); 5) choroidea thickness in foveal center (258. 1 ± 48. 1 vs 315. 8 ± 29. 5 μm, respectively) and 3 mm nasally to foveal center (130. 0 ± 32. 1 vs 161. 0 ± 29. 8 μm, respectively). Conclusion. It is reasonably to isolate <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> and OHT patients into glaucoma high-risk group that requires careful dynamic follow-up and therapy correction.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} difference between form-deprived myopia (FDM) and lens-induced myopia (LIM), {{the degree of}} <b>myopia,</b> <b>axial</b> length and pathological changes of the posterior sclera from guinea pigs were evaluated. METHODS: Four-week pigmented guinea pigs were randomly assigned into 3 groups, including normal control (n = 6), FDM group with monocular cover (n = 11) and LIM group with monocular - 7 D lens treatment (n = 11). FDM group was form-deprived while LIM group was lens-induced for 14 d. Refractive error and axial length were measured prior to and post treatment, respectively. Morphological changes of sclera were examined using both light and electronic microscopes. RESULTS: After 14 d treatment, refractive errors for FDM group and LIM group were - 3. 05 ± 0. 71 D and - 2. 12 ± 1. 29 D, respectively, which were significantly more myopic than that of normal controls and fellow control eyes (P 0. 05). Under light microscope, both FDM group and LIM group showed thinned sclera, disarrangement of fibrosis and enlarged disassociation between fibers. Consistently, ultrastructural examination showed degenerated fibroblasts and thinned fibers in posterior sclera. CONCLUSION: Following two weeks of myopia induction in guinea pigs, {{with regard to the}} degree of <b>myopia,</b> <b>axial</b> length and pathological alterations, {{there was no significant difference}} between FDM and LIM models. Therefore, FDM and LIM are equally effective and useful as a model of experimental myopia and guinea pigs are ideal animals for induction of experimental myopia because their high sensitivity to both form-deprivation and lens-induction...|$|R
40|$|Intravitreal {{injections}} of kainic acid {{were used to}} examine the significance of normal retinal activity for eye growth in chickens, this acid being chosen because of its known, selective neurotoxic effects on cells in the chicken retina. A 6 nmole dose of kainic significantly reduces amacrine cell numbers when used in very young chickens, while higher doses of kainic acid also affect bipolar and horizontal cell numbers. The effects of intravitreal injection of kainic acid on eye growth were assessed 4 weeks after treatment. A 200 nmole dose of kainic acid, used with day-old and 14 -day-old chickens, had opposing effects on the anterior and posterior segments of the eye; while growth of the anterior segment was inhibited, the posterior segment was enlarged, predominantly in the equatorial direction. A 20 nmole dose of this acid similarly affected growth in 14 -day-old chickens, but in day-old chickens, the anterior segment was also enlarged and the overall eye enlargement had an <b>axial</b> bias. <b>Myopia</b> was the most common refractive error associated with both patterns of development. A 2 nmole dose of kainic acid was without effect on eye growth. Parallels are drawn between these eye enlargement phenomena and those described in chickens whose visual environments have been manipulated. Our results indicate that normal retinal activity is fundamental to normal eye growth in chickens, and furthermore, that growth of the anterior and posterior segments of the chicken eye are independently regulated...|$|R

40|$|The lumican gene (lum), which encodes one of {{the major}} keratan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (KSPGs) in the vertebrate cornea and sclera, has been linked to <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> in humans. In this study, we chose zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model to elucidate the role of lumican in the development of <b>axial</b> <b>myopia.</b> The zebrafish lumican gene (zlum) spans ∼ 4. 6 kb of the zebrafish genome. Like human (hLUM) and mouse (mlum), zlum consists of three exons, two introns, and a TATA box-less promoter at the 5 ′-flanking region of the transcription initiation site. Sequence analysis of the cDNA predicts that zLum encodes 344 amino acids. zLum shares 51 % amino acid sequence identity with human lumican. Similar to hLUM and mlum, zlum mRNA is expressed in the eye and many other tissues, such as brain, muscle, and liver as well. Transgenic zebrafish harboring an enhanced GFP reporter gene construct downstream of a 1. 7 -kb zlum 5 ′-flanking region displayed enhanced GFP expression in the cornea and sclera, as well as throughout the body. Down-regulation of zlum expression by antisense zlum morpholinos manifested ocular enlargement resembling <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> due to disruption of the collagen fibril arrangement in the sclera and resulted in scleral thinning. Administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists, e. g. atropine and pirenzepine, effectively subdued the ocular enlargement caused by morpholinos in in vivo zebrafish larvae assays.

40|$|The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} spherical myopia after penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus is partly {{the result of}} the excessive dioptric power of the grafted cornea which occurs when the diameter selected for the donor button is greater than the diameter of the host incision. This excessive power could be reduced by eliminating disparity between the diameters of the graft and host. To determine what proportion of the myopia in these eyes would persist as a result of <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> the axial lengths of 60 patients grafted for keratoconus and 25 emmetropic controls were compared. A keratometry, objective refraction, and contact probe ultrasonic biometry were performed on all eyes. A comparison of the results with a representational schematic eye indicated that the mean spherical refractive error of the grafted keratoconic eyes (- 4. 83 dioptres) was the combined effect of steepness of the corneal graft (mean radius of curvature 7. 46 mm) and an abnormally great axial length (mean 24. 84 mm). The increased axial length was mainly the result of elongation of the posterior segment of the globe with a small contribution from an increased anterior chamber depth. Though <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> is common in keratoconus, a further study of 70 keratoconic eyes that had not been grafted showed no statistically significant correlation between the posterior segment length and the severity of corneal ectasia. These data suggest that even if excessive corneal power is eliminated after penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus the associated <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> would still produce a mean spherical refractive error of at least - 2. 8 dioptres...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{identify}} whether myopia {{was associated}} with the visual field (VF) progression of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods A total of 270 eyes of 270 POAG followed up for more than 3 years with 9 reliable VFs by Octopus perimetry were retrospectively reviewed. Myopia was divided into: mild myopia (- 2. 99 diopter [D], 0), moderate myopia (- 5. 99, 3. 00 D), marked myopia (- 9. 00,- 6. 00 D) and non-myopia (0 D or more). An annual change in the mean defect (MD) slope> 0. 22 dB/y and 0. 30 dB/y was defined as fast progression, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to determine prognostic factors for VF progression.

40|$|Several {{laboratories}} studying visual deprivation myopia in {{the domestic}} chick report varying degrees of <b>axial</b> elongation and <b>myopia</b> induced by similar visual deprivation techniques. In this study we tested the hypothesis that in different strains of chick the eyes respond differently to visual deprivation. We compared under identical conditions two strains of White Leghorn chick commonly used in ocular development research—the Cornell-K strain (K) and Washington H & N Strain (H/N). The normal development of the eye was found to vary significantly between these strains of White Leghorn chicks. The K strain normally develops flatter corneas, thicker lenses, and larger eyes than the H/N strain. The response to visual deprivation also varies significantly between strains. For example, we find that 2 weeks of visual deprivation in the K strain results in less elongation of the vitreous chamber and flattening of the cornea yielding lower levels of induced myopia compared to the H/N strain. Our results show that while visual experience clearly affects normal ocular development in both strains of chick, {{the nature of the}} effect depends upon not only the type and duration of the experience but the genetics of the subject population as well...|$|R

Eye examination: visometry, automated refractometry, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, determination of the axial length of the eyeball and corneal hysteresis. Results. Significant differences were determined in the indicators of dioptric power of the cornea: 42. 2 dpt in patients with axial and 44. 7 dpt with refractive myopia (p< 0. 05), and also difference between patients with refractive myopia and the control group, in which the diopter power of cornea was 42. 6 (p< 0. 05). There are also {{significant differences in the}} indicators of the axial length of eyes between axial and refractive myopia – 24. 5 ± 0. 64 mm and 23. 1 ± 0. 43 mm (p< 0. 05).

Corneal hysteresis determined significantly reduced on eyes with both the axial and refractive myopia, which was significantly lower than in the indicators of emmetropic eyes of the control group 13. 7 (p< 0. 05). Corneal hysteresis is inversely related to the axial length of the eyeball: in patients with <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> r - 0. 32, p< 0. 05; with refractive myopia r - 0. 36, p< 0. 05.

Starting at about 3 weeks of age, diffuser spectacle lenses were employed to degrade the retinal image in one eye of 13 infant monkeys. The diffusers were worn continuously for periods ranging between 11 and 19 weeks. The effects of three different strengths of optical diffusers, which produced reductions in image contrast that ranged from about 0. 5 to nearly 3 log units, were assessed by retinoscopy and A-scan ultrasonography. Control data were obtained from ten normal infants and three infants reared with clear, zero-powered lenses over both eyes. Eleven of the 13 treated infants developed form-deprivation myopia. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for the three diffuser groups, however, the degree of <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> varied directly with the degree of image degradation. Thus, form-deprivation myopia in monkeys is a graded phenomenon and can be triggered by a modest degree of chronic image degradation...|$|E

Methods: Primary HSF were cultured in vitro and identified with anti-vimentin, anti-keratin, anti-desmin, and anti-S- 100 antibodies. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to study the distribution of ADORs in the HSF cell lines and in the frozen human scleral sections. ADOR protein expression in HSF and human sclera was confirmed by western blot analysis of cell lysates. Results: ADORs were expressed in both HSF and human sclera. This was confirmed by western blot. ADORA 1 expression was concentrated in the nucleus. ADORA 2 A was concentrated mainly in one side of the cytoplasm, and ADORA 2 B was found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

In intra-animal inter-eye comparison and intra-eye follow-up comparison in groups 1 and 2, the study eyes {{as compared to the}} contralateral eyes showed a dose-dependent reduction in axial elongation. In group 3, study eyes and control eyes did not differ significantly in axial elongation. Immunohistochemistry revealed amphiregulin labelling at the retinal pigment epithelium in eyes with lens-induced myopization and Ringer's solution injection, but not in eyes with amphiregulin antibody injection. Intraocular injections of amphiregulin-antibody led to a reduction of lens-induced axial myopic elongation and of the physiological eye enlargement in young guinea pigs.

In order {{to investigate the}} phenotypic spectrum resulting from MIR 184 mutation, MIR 184 was sequenced in a keratoconus cohort of mixed ethnicity and a Chinese <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> cohort. METHODS. Sequencing of MIR 184 was performed in 780 unrelated keratoconus patients and 96 unrelated Han southern Chinese subjects with <b>axial</b> <b>myopia.</b> Effects of identified mutations on RNA secondary structure were predicted computationally using mFold and RNAFold algorithms. MIR 184 amplicons from patients harboring mutations were cloned and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK 293 T) cells, and mature mutant miR 184 expression was analyzed by stem-loop real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS. Two novel heterozygous substitution mutations in MIR 184 were identified in the two patients with isolated keratoconus: miR- 184 ({thorn} 8 C>A) and miR- 184 ({thorn} 3 A>G). Computational modeling predicted that these mutations would alter the miR- 184 stem-loop stability and secondary structure. Ex vivo miR- 184 expression analysis demonstrated that miR 184 ({thorn} 8 C>A) almost completely repressed the expression of miR- 184 (P = 0. 022), and miR- 184 ({thorn} 3 A>G) reduced the expression of miR- 184 by approximately 40 % (P = 0. 002).

Recent {{investigations}} {{have suggested that}} scleral thinning in mammalian eyes with <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> {{is a consequence of}} the loss of scleral tissue, rather than the redistribution of existing tissue as the eye enlarges. The present study investigated whether further changes in the distribution and metabolism of scleral tissue occur during the process of recovery from <b>axial</b> <b>myopia.</b> Scleral glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis and content as well as scleral dry weight changes were monitored as indicators of remodeling in myopic and recovering tree shrew sclerae. METHODS. Myopia was induced in tree shrews by monocularly depriving them of pattern vision. Some animals then had the occluder removed and were allowed to recover from the induced myopia for periods of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days. Newly synthesized GAGs were radiolabeled in vivo with [35 S]sulfate. Sulfate incorporation and total GAG content in the sclera was measured through selective precipitation of GAGs from proteinase K digests with alcian blue dye. Dry weights of the sclerae were also determined. Changes in ocular refraction and eye size were monitored using retinoscopy, keratometry, and ultrasonography. RESULTS.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scans were done using RS- 3000, and the mGCC thickness/significance maps within a 9 -mm diameter circle were generated using built-in software. We compared the difference of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy between the nonhighly myopic database and the highly myopic database for differentiating the early glaucomatous eyes from the nonglaucomatous eyes. ResultsThis study enrolled 15 normal eyes and 34 eyes with glaucoma. The mean mGCC thickness of the glaucoma group was significantly {{less than that of}} the normal group (p <  0. 001). Sensitivity was 96. 3 %, and the specificity was 50. 0 % when using the nonhighly myopic normative database. When the highly myopic normative database was used, the sensitivity was 88. 9 %, and the specificity was 90. 0 %. The false positive rate was significantly lower when using the highly myopic normative database (p <  0. 05). ConclusionThe evaluations of glaucoma in eyes with high myopia using a nonhighly myopic normative database may lead to a frequent misdiagnosis. When evaluating glaucoma in high myopic eyes, the mGCC thickness determined by the long axial length high myopic normative database should be applied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{potential}} of myopic corneal refractive laser surgery to induce <b>myopia</b> (<b>axial</b> elongation) and potential interactions between aberrations (generally resulting from the procedure) and myopia development in chicks (Gallus domesticus). Ten white Leghorn chicks were monolaterally treated one day post-hatching with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), with a nominal dioptric change of − 9. 9 D (imposed hyperopia). Axial length was measured using an adapted ultrasonic biometer; corneal radius of curvature was measured using a custom-built videokeratometer and spherical error and high order aberrations were measured using custom-built Hartmann–Shack aberrometer post-operatively on days 9, 12, 14 and 16 after hatching. Two-weeks after surgery, {{there were no significant}} differences in corneal radius of curvature between treated and control eyes. Astigmatism increased on average by a factor of 2. 6 and 3 rd and higher order aberrations by a factor of 4. 3 after PRK. Both treated and control eyes were close to emmetropia, and no axial elongation was found in the treated eyes. The inability of the refractive procedure to achieve significant reductions in the corneal power could be attributed to the biomechanical properties of the chick eye. High order aberrations induced significant contrast decrease (by a factor of 1. 7 at 4. 5 c/deg). However, reduced image quality neither produced myopic refractive error nor axial elongation in the treated eyes. Both normal and treated eyes emmetropized, indicating that increased amounts of aberrations do not appear to be a risk factor for myopia...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular matrix {{proteins}} {{have been}} implicated in protein remodelling of the sclera in refractive error. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) falling into the collagenase (MMP 1, MMP 8, MMP 13), gelatinase (MMP 2, MMP 9) and stromelysin (MMP 3, MMP 10, MMP 11) functional groups are particularly important. We wished to assess their association with myopia, refractive error and ocular biometric measures in an Australian cohort. A total of 543 unrelated individuals of Caucasian ethnicity were genotyped including 269 myopes (≤- 1. 0 D) and 274 controls (>- 1. 0 D). Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n = 53) were chosen to encompass these eight MMPs. Association tests were performed using linear and logistic regression analysis with age and gender as covariates. Spherical equivalent, <b>myopia,</b> <b>axial</b> length, anterior chamber depth and corneal curvature were the phenotypes of interest. Initial findings indicated that the best p values for each trait were 0. 02 for myopia at rs 2274755 (MMP 9), 0. 02 for SE at both rs 3740938 (MMP 8) and rs 131451 (MMP 11), 0. 01 for axial length at rs 11225395 (MMP 8), 0. 01 for anterior chamber depth at rs 498186 (MMP 1) and 0. 02 at rs 10488 (MMP 1). However, following correction for multiple testing, none of these SNPs remained statistically significant. Our data suggests that the MMPs in the collagenase, gelatinase and stromelysin categories {{do not appear to}} be associated with myopia, refractive error or ocular biometric measures in this cohort...|$|R

40|$|Pur po se: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between keratoconus and <b>axial</b> <b>myopia</b> and also to compare anterior chamber depth, axial length and posterior segment length in normal eyes and keratoconic eyes using ultrasound biometry. Ma te ri al and Met hod: In this study, refraction and ocular biometry in 44 keratoconus eyes and 44 emmetropic eyes were evaluated prospectively. All subjects underwent axial length and anterior chamber depth measurement by ultrasound biometry. Statistical methods were employed to compare the two groups and to ascertain whether any associations exist. Re sults: The axial length was significantly longer in the keratoconic group than in the emmetropic control group in a statistically significant fashion. The mean axial lengths in the keratoconic and emmetropic groups were 23. 83 ± 0. 72 and 22. 81 ± 0. 66 mm, respectively (p= 0. 001). The mean posterior segment length in the keratoconic group was 19. 96 ± 0. 41 vs. 19. 63 ± 0. 54 mm in the emmetropic group (p= 0. 002). The mean keratometry for the keratoconic group correlated with spherical equivalence and visual acuity. Dis cus si on: Keratoconic eyes have on average longer axial lengths and posterior segment lengths than emmetropic eyes. This finding suggests a statistical relationship between keratoconus and <b>axial</b> <b>myopia.</b> (Turk J Ophthalmol 2012; 42 : 246 - 8...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) {{in the treatment of}} pathological myopia. METHODS: The study included 52 eyes in 43 patients with pathological myopia who underwent PSR (PSR group), and 52 eyes in 36 age- and myopia-matched patients who did not undergo such treatment as control group. Axial length, refraction error, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and macular scans by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were recorded at baseline, 6 mo, 1, 3 and 5 y after the surgery, and the complications were noted. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in axial length, refractive error, or BCVA between the PSR group and the control group at baseline. At the end of the follow-up, the mean axial length was 29. 79 ± 1. 26 mm in the PSR group, which was significantly shorter than that in the control group (30. 78 ± 1. 30 mm) (P＜ 0. 01), and the mean refractive error was - 16. 86 ± 2. 53 D in the PSR group, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (- 19. 18 ± 2. 12 D) (P＜ 0. 01). A statistically significant difference in BCVA was found between the PSR group (0. 51 [*]± 0. 25 logMAR) and the control group (0. 62 [*]± 0. 26 logMAR) at the postoperative 5 -year follow-up (P＜ 0. 01). There were no serious complications during the 5 -year follow-up period. CONCLUSION: PSR can prevent <b>axial</b> elongation and <b>myopia</b> progression in eyes with pathological myopia...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the target refraction {{of patients with}} binocular myopia and monocular cataract after intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Methods: This study comprised 199 patients with binocular <b>myopia</b> (<b>axial</b> length> 25 mm) and monocular cataract after IOL im-plantation {{for the removal of}} the monocular cataract. The research was conducted using a questionnaire method and by perform-ing statistical analysis of the refractive outcomes. Results: The patients are grouped into 3 domains (≤- 3 D group,- 3 ~- 6 D group,>- 6 D group). There were no statistically sig-nificant differences among the 3 groups; whereas the satisfaction of the present corrected state was statistically low in the>- 6 D group (p < 0. 05). The satisfaction of the corrected state was statistically high in the group of postoperative anisometropia under 3 D (p < 0. 05). There was no statistical difference between the groups on the satisfaction of target diopter (- 2 ~- 3 D or emme-tropia). In terms of correction method, glasses were worn in 119 patients (60 %), contact lenses were worn in 26 patients (13 %), and monovision was used in 14 patients (7 %) were used respectively. Forty patients (20 %) with implanted IOL in both eyes did not use any of the correction methods above. Except for the contact lens group, the general satisfaction and the satisfaction of the present corrected state were statistically lower than the other group (p < 0. 05). There was no statistically significant differ-ence among the 3 groups in the percentage of cataract surgery in the fellow eye. Conclusions: There was no statistical difference between the groups in satisfaction of target diopter (- 2 ~- 3 D or emmetropia) ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between objectively measured ambient light exposure and longitudinal changes in axial eye growth in childhood. METHODS A total of 101 children (41 myopes and 60 nonmyopes), 10 to 15 years of age participated in this prospective longitudinal observational study. Axial eye growth was determined from measurements of ocular optical biometry collected at four study visits over an 18 -month period. Each child’s mean daily light exposure was derived from two periods (each 14 days long) of objective light exposure measurements from a wrist-worn light sensor. RESULTS Over the 18 -month study period, a modest but statistically significant association between greater average daily light exposure and slower axial eye growth was observed (P ¼ 0. 047). Other significant predictors of axial eye growth in this population included children’s refractive error group (P < 0. 001), sex (P < 0. 01), and age (P < 0. 001). Categorized according to their objectively measured average daily light exposure and adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, baseline <b>axial</b> length, parental <b>myopia,</b> nearwork, and physical activity), children experiencing low average daily light exposure (mean daily light exposure: 459 6 117 lux, annual eye growth: 0. 13 mm/y) exhibited significantly greater eye growth than children experiencing moderate (842 6 109 lux, 0. 060 mm/y), and high (1455 6 317 lux, 0. 065 mm/y) average daily light exposure levels (P ¼ 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS In this population of children, greater daily light exposure was associated with less axial eye growth over an 18 -month period. These findings support the role of light exposure in the documented association between time spent outdoors and childhood myopia...|$|R
