5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an <b>axisymmetric</b> shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, high clouds {{indicated}} the presence of intense convection, and the cyclone featured an <b>axisymmetric</b> cloud structure, with a distinct, cloud-free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole. Soon thereafter, the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward, meandering toward the Aegean Sea and Turkey. Initially remaining stationary between Greece and Sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002mbar (29.59inHg), the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days, influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low, now far to the east, and a high-pressure area above central and eastern Europe. The system's atmospheric pressure increased throughout 15January {{due to the fact}} it was embedded within a large-scale environment, with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region, and was not a sign of deintensification.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} 100 years, applied {{scientists}} including Stodola (1903, 1927–1945), Pfleiderer (1952), Hawthorne (1964), Shepard (1956), Lakshminarayana (1996), and Japikse (many texts including citations), have educated young engineers in {{the fundamentals of}} turbomachinery. These understandings apply to all dynamic, continuous-flow, <b>axisymmetric</b> pumps, fans, blowers, and compressors in axial, mixed-flow and radial/centrifugal configurations.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} field strength at Saturn's equator is about 21μT (0.21G), which {{corresponds to a}} dipole magnetic moment of about 4.6 T•m3. This makes Saturn's {{magnetic field}} slightly weaker than Earth's; however, its magnetic moment is about 580times larger. Saturn's magnetic dipole is strictly aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the field, uniquely, is highly <b>axisymmetric.</b> The dipole is slightly shifted (by 0.037Rs) along Saturn's rotational axis towards the north pole.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} special forms of {{determinants}} {{has been the}} natural result of {{the completion of the}} general theory. <b>Axisymmetric</b> determinants have been studied by Lebesgue, Hesse, and Sylvester; persymmetric determinants by Sylvester and Hankel; circulants by Catalan, Spottiswoode, Glaisher, and Scott; skew determinants and Pfaffians, in connection with the theory of orthogonal transformation, by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; Wronskians (so called by Muir) by Christoffel and Frobenius; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and Hessians by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by Trudi. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.|$|E
500|$|Early {{studies of}} black holes relied on {{explicit}} solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used {{to describe a}} static black hole) and the <b>axisymmetric</b> Kerr solution (used to describe a rotating, stationary black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. In the long run, they are rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, location at a specified time and electric charge. This is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorems: [...] "black holes have no hair", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective {{of the complexity of}} a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, {{following}} a controversial debate with Einstein, Silberstein published {{a solution of}} Einstein's field equations that appeared to describe a static, <b>axisymmetric</b> metric with only two point singularities representing two point masses. Such a solution clearly violates our understanding of gravity: with nothing to support them and no kinetic energy to hold them apart, the two masses should fall towards each other due to their mutual gravity, {{in contrast with the}} static nature of Silberstein's solution. This led Silberstein to claim that A. Einstein's theory was flawed, in need of a revision. In response, Einstein and Rosen published a Letter to the Editor in which they pointed out a critical flaw in Silberstein's reasoning. Unconvinced, Silberstein took the debate to the popular press, with The Evening Telegram in Toronto publishing an article titled [...] "Fatal blow to relativity issued here" [...] on March 7, 1936. Nonetheless, Einstein was correct and Silberstein was wrong: as we know today, all solutions to Weyl's family of <b>axisymmetric</b> metrics, of which Silberstein's is one example, necessarily contain singular structures ("struts", [...] "ropes", or [...] "membranes") that are responsible for holding masses against the attractive force of gravity in a static configuration.|$|E
