The necessary <b>addendum</b> <b>correction</b> to allow the use of small-numbered pinions can either be obtained by suitable modification of this rack to a cycloidal form at the tips, or by hobbing at other than the theoretical pitch circle diameter. [...] Since the gear ratio between hob and blank is fixed, the resulting gear will have the correct pitch on the pitch circle, but the tooth thickness will not be equal to the space width.|$|E
40|$|For {{some time}} now, I have catalogued Roman {{features}} I encountered in my studies, first in GoogleEarth, later I switched to QGIS, {{and over time}} produced this map. It was always meant for my personal use, so it does {{not live up to}} academic standards - most sites are only a rough localisation, several km off the actual site; I included literature sources, but in short forms that are probably only decipherable by myself. Still, I upload it here to see if anyone is nevertheless interested in this data; if you are, I'd be happy to hear about it, send you more data layers, receive <b>addenda,</b> <b>corrections</b> or questions...|$|R

40|$|The paper embraces three related subjects: Photo-elastic {{measurement}} of stresses in spur gear teeth; interpretation of stresses so found to give revised strength factors for B. S. specification {{on the design}} of spur gears; and a tentative attempt to correlate the stresses found with fatigue-test results which have been reported by various investigators. The object of t h i s paper is to propose maximum safe bending loads which involute spur gears can be allowed to carry. The gears investigated are confined to those which can be generated by standard cutters conforming to the 20 -deg. pressure-angle, B. S. basic rack, without either causing under-cutting near the root or undue pointing of the teeth. The values proposed are based on a photo-elastic investigation carried out by the author under the guidance of Professor W. A. Tuplin, at the Post Graduate School of Applied Mechanics, Sheffield University. Strength factors for spur gears are given in the form of charts. These factors embrace the whole possible range of spur-gear combinations, both with and without <b>addendum</b> <b>corrections.</b> To enable a rational assessment of strength to be made, a list of service factors, as well as a graph correlating bending-fatigue data for three classes of surface finish (ground and polished, shaved, hobbed) are given...|$|R

(For commercial use please ask me, I'm not a greedy person, and am sure we can find an agreement easily.) The catalogue started out in GoogleEarth, and was later switched to QGIS (currently 2. 8. 10). It was always meant for my personal use, so it does {{not live up to}} academic standards - most sites are only a rough localisation, several km off the actual site; I included literature sources, but in short forms that are probably only decipherable by myself. I'm happily available for clarifications if needed, as well as for <b>addenda,</b> <b>corrections</b> or questions. Additional data (QGIS project file, collection of georeferenced excavation maps as raster overlays and so on) are available on request. The data was not collected systematically, there is no claim to completeness in any field - generally coverage is probably best near my own location (SE Austria) and research focus, and gets thinner with distance from there. Work is ongoing, apart from adding new findspots, I'm planning to improve the integration with vici. org datasets, and improve vague literature sources with more precise excavation reports, and precision of dot location...|$|R

40|$|The Area 25 Reactor Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly Decontamination Facility is {{identified}} in the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) as Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 254. CAU 254 is located in Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site and consists of a single Corrective Action Site CAS 25 - 23 - 06. CAU 254 will be closed, {{in accordance with the}} FFACO of 1996. CAU 254 was used primarily to perform radiological decontamination and consists of Building 3126, two outdoor decontamination pads, and surrounding soil within an existing perimeter fence. The site was used to decontaminate nuclear rocket test-car hardware and tooling from the early 1960 s through the early 1970 s, and to decontaminate a military tank in the early 1980 s. The site characterization results indicate that, in places, the surficial soil and building materials exceed clean-up criteria for organic compounds, metals, and radionuclides. Closure activities are expected to generate waste streams consisting of nonhazardous construction waste. petroleum hydrocarbon waste, hazardous waste, low-level radioactive waste, and mixed waste. Some of the wastes exceed land disposal restriction limits and will require off-site treatment before disposal. The recommended corrective action was revised to Alternative 3 - ''Unrestricted Release Decontamination, Verification Survey, and Dismantle Building 3126,'' in an <b>addendum</b> to the <b>Correction</b> Action Decision Document...|$|R
