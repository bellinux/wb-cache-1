It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.|$|E

25|$|The Almanack {{contained}} the calendar, weather, poems, sayings and astronomical and astrological information that a typical almanac {{of the period}} would contain. Franklin also included the occasional mathematical exercise, and the Almanack from 1750 features an early example of demographics. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin's aphorisms and proverbs, many of which live on in American English. These maxims typically counsel thrift and courtesy, with <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> cynicism.|$|E
25|$|Wodehouse based the Drones Club on a {{combination}} of three real London clubs: the Bachelors' Club (which existed {{around the turn of the}} century), Buck's Club (established 1919), and <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> the Bath Club for its swimming pool's ropes and rings. The fictional Drones barman, McGarry, has the same surname as the Buck's first bartender, a Mr McGarry (Buck's barman from 1919 to 1941, credited with creating the Buck's Fizz and Sidecar cocktails). However Evelyn Waugh declared that the Drones did not resemble any real club in 1920s London.|$|E

500|$|Despite its popularity, a few music critics {{including}} Robert Copsey from Digital Spy {{criticized the}} song for being monotonous. Cospey wrote that [...] "you could slap an LMFAO tag {{on the cover}} and few would know the difference" [...] and Paul Lester of The Guardian similarly labelled it as [...] "generic ravey Euro dance with guitars". Lester described the song as [...] "Pump Up the Jam meets the Macarena with <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Cotton Eye Joe" [...] while Robert Myers of The Village Voice dismissed [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] as an [...] "inspired piece of silliness".|$|E
500|$|In {{reference}} to the song [...] "Secrets of the Sun", Binkelman describes [...] "lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic with <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> wistfulness besides". The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch. [...] Parsons details this as [...] "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements". [...] Debbage writes that [...] "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph’s uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.|$|E
500|$|Underground {{magazine}} {{were also}} enthusiastic: [...] "This month I'm pleased to say, what's really moving is entirely British. The best groove {{so far this}} year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it should be done, a one-sided, one-track 12inch (it doesn't need any dub or instrumentals). 'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Overlord" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewer Erik Brudvig of IGN described [...] "Overlord" [...] as [...] "one {{of the best}} series of missions that the franchise has yet seen." [...] Similarly, reviewer Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer opined that the pack [...] "never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long, leavening the expected duck-and-cover combat with openworld exploration and <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> environmental puzzling, all {{wrapped up in a}} story that builds to a satisfying and pathos-heavy finale." [...] GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that [...] "a few of the larger environments let you take on [...] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of Mass Effect 2s battles." [...] He also praised the final boss battle, which was said to exceed that of the main game.|$|E
500|$|Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was {{critical}} of Izzie's ethics in cutting Denny's LVAD wire, writing that she [...] "should not be practising medicine" [...] and stating: [...] "That's the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy, anymore, because the super hot blond chick can make an earth-shattering, fatal decision and she doesn't get canned." [...] Regarding the second season, Kevin Carr from 7M Pictures said [...] "Rhimes really just put Scrubs, E.R., Sex and the City and even <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> The Love Boat in a blender and poured out Grey's Anatomy." [...] Also {{in regard to the}} second season, Christopher Monfette of IGN TV said [...] " [...] The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons - all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack".|$|E
500|$|Ben Hogwood from musicOMH {{declared}} the song as [...] "top notch, diamond-encrusted pop" [...] {{along with other}} tracks like [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "Paparazzi". He found the lyrics to be sometimes odd, especially the statement, [...] "I'm on a mission, and it involves some heavy touchin'." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe said that the song [...] "has a gutter level quippage with sinuous moves". Priya Elan from The Times was not impressed with the song and called it calculated. Billboard music editor Chris Williams gave the song a positive review, commenting that [...] "It has all the winning ingredients of its predecessors: a radio-friendly, club/electropop feel; a provocative, yet silly enough catchphrase and hook; and <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> '80s synth magic, so the adults can play along. On 'LoveGame' Gaga is in it to win it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost in 1874 as Boletus salmonicolor, based on specimens he {{collected in the}} New England area of the United States. In a 1983 publication, mycologist Roy Halling declared Boletus subluteus (described by Charles Horton Peck in 1887; Ixocomus subluteus is a later combination based on this name) and Suillus pinorigidus (described by Wally Snell and Esther A. Dick in 1956) to be synonymous. Halling also reexamined Frost's type specimen of B.salmonicolor, and considered the taxon better placed in Suillus because of its glutinous cap, dotted stem, and ring; he formally transferred it to that genus, resulting in the combination Suillus salmonicolor. The specific epithet salmonicolor is a Latin color term meaning [...] "pink with <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> yellow". The mushroom {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "slippery Jill".|$|E
500|$|Spector, {{also in the}} album's 1957 liner notes, {{reported}} on another of Angelou's concerts in the Beverly Hills nightclub The Keyboard, when she performed many of the songs on Miss Calypso. [...] He called her a polite, soft-spoken, calm, and poised young woman [...] "that completely mystified the audience". [...] He found that Angelou's performance made an indelible impression {{and that she had}} an unusual voice and striking appearance. [...] Spector stated, [...] "She had captured the audience swiftly and effectively with her calm and affectionate manner", and promised that she would do the same for listeners of the album. [...] He also predicted that she was [...] "destined to become a very big name in show business". [...] Spector characterized Angelou's music as [...] "calypso style with a liberal sprinkling of Afro-Cuban, and <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> blues mixed together with delicate jazz".|$|E
500|$|The game {{is played}} {{primarily}} through [...] "pointing and clicking" [...] with the mouse and a few keyboard commands.

Observing their spacecraft from the rear, players fly their ships by moving the mouse in the direction they want the vessels to go. Freelancers spacecraft follow simplistic flight dynamics; however, <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> realism is implemented by allowing the vessels to cut power to their engines and turn to face any direction while drifting along their original pathconservation of momentum. Clicking the mouse button shoots the ship's weapons at the location of the cursor. The interface has no radar display; the location of objects not shown on the screen are indicated by pointers at the screen's edges. Targeting, communications, and navigation data are displayed in information boxes that can be minimized.|$|E

500|$|Eric Slatt (David Bamber) is {{the deputy}} {{headmaster}} of Galfast High, {{who seems to}} [...] "deepen the many crises that face the school (most of Slatt’s own making)". Jeff Evans, writing in The Penguin TV Companion, observed that [...] "Slatt is certainly keen, but regrettably he is also unbalanced, tactless, clumsy, snobby, sarcastic, at times pointlessly aggressive and always prone to appalling errors of judgment (an academic version of Basil Fawlty, it was widely noted)". The Independent commented: [...] "Chalk is in the idiom of sadistic farce: disaster begets catastrophe begets apocalypse, and they all engulf Slatt. There are inevitable echoes of other sitcom characters - <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Basil Fawlty's unquenchable apoplexy, a slice of Gordon Brittas's purblind monomania - but Slatt's entanglements are caused by his own cocktail of failings."

500|$|Among mixed reviews, Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticized A Ghost Is Born as [...] "wildly uneven" [...] and [...] "less {{cohesive}} {{than any}} other Wilco release." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called it a [...] "privileged self-indulgence" [...] due to its extreme musical dynamics. NME wrote of the album: [...] "It's like Scissor Sisters on tranquilisers. With a bit of ELO. And <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Ramones. And, with this eclecticism, a worrying lack of focus." [...] Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune felt that the album possessed an [...] "incomplete" [...] quality which nonetheless can be [...] "quite intriguing, more of a side step than a forward leap, but a worthy experiment all the same." [...] Ann Powers of Blender wrote that on first listen, the album is [...] "rather monotonous, a bunch of moderately singable tunes with some noise piled up around the edges", but that it [...] "starts to insinuate meaning" [...] over subsequent listens.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot wrote that The Revivals [...] "lull" [...] adult contemporary ballads were redeemed by songs with [...] "Sly Stone, Ray Charles, doo-wop and Motown influences ...

Greg Sandow from Entertainment Weekly commended the group for [...] "building momentum by adding new elements as the songs proceed" [...] and [...] "setting the course for whatever future the [...] genre is likely to have". Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times said although their [...] "offbeat R hybrids" [...] are occasionally [...] "too busy and intentionally oddball", [...] "the Tonys' explorations ... are mostly successful". Orlando Sentinel writer Parry Gettelman said the dance-oriented tracks [...] "have great grooves and a warmth, humor and vocal finesse sadly lacking in the Top 40".
