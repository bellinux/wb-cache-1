Some examples of time, place, <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> cases include: Grayned v. Rockford (1972), Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (1981), Madsen v.

50|$|Time, place, <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> {{restrictions}} {{refer to}} a legal doctrine enforced under the United States Constitution and Supreme Court. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines time, place, <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> restrictions as “A restriction on the time, place, or manner of expression that is justified when it is neutral as to content and serves a significant government interest and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication. The goal of time, place <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> restrictions is to regulate speech {{in a way that}} still protects freedom of speech.|$|R
5|$|Swedish {{migration}} peaked 1870-1900. By 1890, the U.S. census {{reported a}} Swedish-American population of nearly 800,000. Many {{of the immigrants}} became classic pioneers, clearing and cultivating the prairies of the Great Plains, while others remained in the cities, particularly Chicago. Single young women usually went straight from agricultural work in the Swedish countryside to jobs as housemaids. Many established Swedish Americans visited the old country in the later 19th century, their narratives illustrating the difference in customs <b>and</b> <b>manners.</b> Some made the journey {{with the intention of}} spending their declining years in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was {{anything}} but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods <b>and</b> <b>manners</b> of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{the society}} {{presented}} a new code and system of bylaws {{for the government}} of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions <b>and</b> <b>manners</b> of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.|$|E
50|$|A {{government}} can regulate pure speech if the regulation {{is a valid}} time, place, <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> regulation. In order to be a permissible time, place, <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> regulation, the regulation must be content neutral and serve an important governmental interest. The regulation must be narrowly tailored to achieve this governmental interest, and the government regulation must leave ample alternative channels of communication open to speakers. The Ninth Circuit Court held that the Municipal Code that banned tattoo parlors in Hermosa Beach was not a valid time, place <b>and</b> <b>manner</b> restriction.|$|R

5|$|The West Wycombe {{estate was}} {{acquired}} by Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his brother Samuel in 1698. Dashwood demolished the existing manor house and built a modern mansion on higher ground nearby. This mansion forms {{the core of the}} present house. Images of the house on early estate plans show a red-brick house with stone dressings and a hipped roof in the contemporary Queen Anne style. In 1724, Dashwood bequeathed this square conventional house to his 16-year-old son, the 2nd Baronet, also Francis, who later inherited the title Baron le Despencer through his mother and is perhaps best known for establishing the Hellfire Club close to the mansion, in the West Wycombe Caves. Between 1726 and 1741, Dashwood embarked on a series of Grand Tours: the ideas <b>and</b> <b>manners</b> he learned during this period influenced him throughout his life and were pivotal in the rebuilding of his father's simple house, transforming it into the classical edifice that exists today.|$|E

Catherine marries him instead of Heathcliff because of his higher social status, with disastrous results to all characters in the story.|$|E
25|$|From the 12th century onward chivalry {{came to be}} {{understood}} as a moral, religious and social code of knightly conduct. The particulars of the code varied, but codes would emphasise the virtues of courage, honour, and service. Chivalry also came to refer to an idealisation of the life <b>and</b> <b>manners</b> of the knight at home in his castle and with his court.|$|E
25|$|Catherine {{was also}} {{responsible}} for introducing the lasting affection for all things French to the Russian court. While she personally disliked France, her distaste did not extend to its culture <b>and</b> <b>manners.</b> French became {{the language of the}} court; Russian was relegated for use only when speaking to servants and inferiors. The Russian aristocracy was encouraged to embrace the philosophies of Molière, Racine and Corneille. The Winter Palace was to {{serve as a model for}} numerous Russian palaces belonging to Catherine's aristocracy, all of them, like the Winter Palace itself, built by the slave labour of Russian serfs. The sophistication <b>and</b> <b>manners</b> observed inside the Winter Palace were greatly at odds with the grim reality of life outside its externally gilded walls. In 1767, as the Winter Palace grew in richness and splendour, the Empress published an edict extending Russian serfdom. During her reign she further enslaved over a million peasants. Work continued on the Winter Palace right up until the time of the Empress' death in 1796.|$|E

25|$|This {{apparent}} {{weakness is}} balanced by mutual-aid systems established by extended {{family members to}} provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as religion <b>and</b> <b>manners</b> to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels in the African-American community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.|$|E
