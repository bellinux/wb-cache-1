Thus the 2:3 ratio above means Pluto completes two orbits {{in the time it takes}} Neptune to complete three. In the case of resonance relationships between three or more bodies, either type of ratio may be used (in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other) and the type of ratio will be specified.|$|E
500|$|While Staunton {{was busy}} with the Shakespeare edition, he {{received}} a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the recent First American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy [...] "for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion" [...] and pointing {{out that he had}} not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in The Illustrated London News that he had [...] "been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game...If Mr. Morphy—for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration—be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions... ready to test and do honor to his prowess."In reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit New Orleans for the purpose of encountering Mr. Paul Morphy at Chess, permit me to mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon the practice of the game almost entirely except in the most desultory manner, and at the present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty I am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation.Under the circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest, even in this Metropolis, would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for the recovery of my old strength in play, together with such arrangements as would prevent the sacrifice of my professional engagements {{for the sake of a}} match at chess, and that the idea of undertaking one in a foreign country, many thousand miles from here, is admissible only in a dream.With friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist, whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate, and with compliments to you for the honour implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion, I beg to subscribe myself, with every consideration.Yours obediently,H. Staunton"—from Evidently reprinted from [...] Chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton's letter and <b>article</b> <b>should</b> have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Some other chess historians disagree with Murray's interpretation of Staunton's response. Staunton did offer to play Morphy by electric telegraph, a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically. However this offer arrived after Morphy had left for Europe—which perhaps was fortunate, as the newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866.|$|E

2500|$|Attachment {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} category of alternative child mental health interventions intended to treat attachment disorders. The term generally includes accompanying parenting techniques. Other names or particular techniques include [...] "the Evergreen model", [...] "holding time", [...] "rage-reduction", [...] "compression therapy", [...] "rebirthing", [...] "corrective attachment therapy" [...] and Coercive Restraint Therapy. It is found {{primarily in the}} United States, {{and much of it}} is centered in about a dozen clinics in Evergreen, Colorado, where Foster Cline, one of the founders, established his clinic in the 1970s. This article describes this particular set of interventions although in clinical literature the term [...] "attachment therapy" [...] is sometimes used loosely to mean any intervention based on attachment theory, particularly outside the US. Attachment therapy as described in this <b>article</b> <b>should</b> not be confused with other schools of therapy which are more empirically based and which aim to address problems stemming from disrupted attachment to caregivers.|$|E

The top five signatories were Elise Springer (Wesleyan University), Alexis Shotwell (Carleton University), Dilek Huseyinzadegan (Emory University), Lori Gruen (Wesleyan University; co-editor of Hypatia 2008–2010 and member of Tuvel's dissertation committee in 2014), and Shannon Winnubst (Ohio State University). Cressida Heyes, an Hypatia associate editor, responded on 30 April by posting an apology on Facebook—first on her own page and on 1 May on Hypatias—signed by [...] "a majority of the Hypatia's Board of Associated Editors". The apology said the <b>article</b> <b>should</b> not have been published. On 2 May the open letter, by then with 830 signatories, was delivered to the editor-in-chief, Sally Scholz.|$|E

He was exposed to the authors who would motivate him to become a writer: Toni Morrison and Sandra Cisneros. He worked his way through college by delivering pool tables, washing dishes, pumping gas, and working at Raritan River Steel. During an interview conducted in 2010, Díaz reflected on his experience growing up in America and working his way through college: [...] A pervasive theme in his short story collection Drown is the absence of a father, which reflects Diaz's strained relationship with his own father, with whom he no longer keeps in contact.

2500|$|The Arbitration Committee {{presides over}} the {{ultimate}} dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an <b>article</b> <b>should</b> read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly {{rule on the}} specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, functioning {{not so much to}} resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [...] ). Its remedies include cautions and [...] (used in 63% of cases) and [...] (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.|$|E

Generally, a circle [...] in diameter larger and [...] taller than the test article is required. The arrangement should avoid symmetry to reduce the potential for adverse coupling of plane waves. The test article can be mounted on a platform or suspended. Multiple microphones, eight to sixteen, should be used for control with either the SISO or MIMO methods. The microphones should be placed randomly around the test article. The distance from the surface of the drivers to the surface of the control microphones should be [...] The distance from the control microphones to the surface of the test <b>article</b> <b>should</b> be [...] The height of the control microphones should be centered at mid-height of the test item and randomly varied up and down by about one-eighth of the test item height. The orientation of the free-field microphones in a DFAT test arrangement is not critical. However, reflections from the test article can be minimized with the microphone oriented toward the sound source with a 0 degree incidence. Most modern day, quality measurement, free-field microphones are factory adjusted to compensate for incident angle. This phenomenon is most pronounced at high frequencies, above 10kHz for a 1/4" [...] microphone, and is inversely proportional to microphone diaphragm diameter.|$|E
