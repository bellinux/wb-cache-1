5|$|In September 1995, {{the band}} started writing and {{recording}} their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band <b>amicably</b> to pursue other projects. Justin Chancellor, {{a member of}} former tourmates Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E. Shepherd Stevenson, and ZAUM's Marco Fox.|$|E
5|$|In {{all this}} time the band had been writing new songs and, in September 1998, they began to record a new album, but touring {{commitments}} and new line-up changes prevented Girlschool to complete it. In fact, Johnson quit <b>amicably</b> Girlschool in 1999, followed by Lamb in 2000. They were replaced by new lead guitarist Jackie 'Jax' Chambers and by Enid Williams, who finally rejoined the group after eighteen years. Johnson, who {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer, and Lamb remained anyway strictly associated with the other band members.|$|E

5|$|Jost Hite, a German immigrant, {{purchased}} a large land grant {{in the northern}} Shenandoah Valley in 1731. Peter Stephens and a small party of German Protestants from Heidelberg, in the Palatinate, arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land, including the site of what became Stephens City, named for the Stephens family. Although Hite's title to the land was challenged by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the land baron of the area, the matter was settled <b>amicably.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely <b>amicably</b> to Roman rule for the next 200 years.|$|E

5|$|Van Halen <b>amicably</b> {{split from}} their long-time label Warner Bros. Records in 2002, {{although}} they would later sign a one-record {{deal with the}} label shortly afterwards for the 2004 release The Best of Both Worlds. The band briefly entered into negotiations with Columbia Records, but these stalled after Roth indicated he would not sign with the label. In November 2011, the band signed with Interscope Records, after its chairman Jimmy Iovine became personally involved in negotiations.|$|E
5|$|After the Rye House Plot of 1683, {{an attempt}} to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and {{gathered}} supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, {{where he had been}} greeted <b>amicably</b> by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.|$|E
5|$|It {{was awarded}} the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, {{credited}} to Aaron Sorkin and Rick Cleveland. In the summer of 2001, a public argument broke out between the two on the internet forum mightybigtv.com (later known as Television Without Pity). Cleveland claimed {{to have had the}} original idea, based on the experiences of his father who was a Korean War veteran, and felt offended that Sorkin had not given him a chance to honor his father’s memory at the award ceremony. Sorkin responded that Cleveland had not contributed significantly, and that writing credits were simply rotated among the staff writers. The argument ended <b>amicably,</b> with Sorkin apologizing for belittling Cleveland's effort and the two writers expressing their admiration for each other.|$|E
5|$|Over dinner, Leslie tells Dave {{that she}} will not move to San Diego with him, as her life is in Pawnee. Dave, {{although}} sad, understands her choice and the two split up <b>amicably.</b> At Pawnee's tree lighting ceremony, Leslie is congratulated by everyone, including Leslie's mother Marlene, who is proud that her daughter successfully fought off the media. Leslie returns to {{work the next day}} much to Ron's immense relief, as he could barely handle just a portion of her daily duties. Everyone is visibly glad that Leslie is back.|$|E
5|$|Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, {{were born}} in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents <b>amicably</b> divorced. Following the divorce, their mother {{attended}} the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. During {{the course of his}} upbringing, Rex wanted to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his father, a defensive pioneer in the NFL known for developing the 46 defense, and by the age of six, Rex and Rob knew they wanted to pursue coaching careers.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{exception}} to this was when land was claimed by the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley, {{in an area that}} is now Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor Clinton of New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved <b>amicably</b> when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E
5|$|Though Roshan {{maintained}} that they parted <b>amicably,</b> the media {{reported that the}} split was due to infidelity on his part, linking him with several actresses, most notably his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut. Roshan denied {{having an affair with}} the actress, and filed a lawsuit against her in 2016 accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover-up their affair for the benefit of his divorce proceedings. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{set himself}} three initial goals in {{civilian}} life—to earn $40 {{million in the}} business world and practice philanthropy, to become an adjunct professor, and to become a professional golfer. Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he <b>amicably</b> left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark wrote two books, Waging Modern War and Winning Modern Wars. He also authored forewords for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials. He had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a {{reported}} US$80million, {{at the time}} the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded <b>amicably</b> in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E
5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} {{had gone on}} a fossil-collecting expedition to Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke had discovered the holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted <b>amicably,</b> Marsh secretly bribed the pit operators to divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope by pointing out that his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (or so he claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published the correction shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Day {{opened a}} new shop in Cheapside, and the next year, he and Seres were {{successful}} enough to <b>amicably</b> separate their businesses. Day set up his new home and printing establishment at Aldersgate in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes and transferred from the Stringers' to the Stationers' Company. Day found Aldersgate's foreigner-friendly attributes helpful in attracting skilled Dutch workers, whom he relied on throughout his career. He soon {{established himself as a}} quality printer, and in 1551, he reprinted an elaborate edition of the Bible that he had previously produced with Seres. The next year, he secured a valuable patent to print the works of John Ponet and Thomas Beccon. This enraged one of his competitors, Reginald Wolfe, who already held a patent to print Ponet's Catechism in Latin. Eventually, a compromise patent was issued which allowed Wolfe to continue printing the Catechism in Latin and Day to print the work in English. Day reaped more benefits from the deal than Wolfe: the English printings were used far more extensively than the Latin ones, and the ABC was eventually appended with Ponet's Catechism.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{talks to}} Kate while driving, imagining her {{sitting in the}} back seat of the car, but she hangs up in jealousy when he {{mentions}} Joely for the first time. He arrives in Sacramento and finds the pet store where Arlen worked. The owner (Maura Tierney) asks Mercer to sing in her children's band, for which she plays as part of her probation. When he returns to the car, he finds somebody trying to break into it, only to discover that it is Kate. They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen (Jsu Garcia) at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him, and they have sex. The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again, more <b>amicably,</b> and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother's ashes.|$|E
5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other <b>amicably</b> again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E
