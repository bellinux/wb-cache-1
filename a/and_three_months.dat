40|$|To {{delineate}} endocrine mechanisms regulating equine luteal {{function and}} the possible functional differences between one <b>month</b> <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> corpora lutea of pregnancy (CL), the in vitro basal releases of prostaglandin F (PGF), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), progesterone, and 17 beta-estradiol by one <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL of pregnant mares were evaluated. In addition, the in vitro effects of PGF 2 alpha PGE 2, progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol on synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) and sex steroids were studied. PGF, PGE 2, and 17 beta-estradiol secretion was higher in one <b>month</b> than in <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL, while progesterone was secreted similarly by both types of CL. PGE 2 treatment decreased 17 beta-estradiol in one month CL; progesterone increased PGE 2 in one <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL; 17 beta-estradiol increased PGE 2 in one month CL. This study suggests that, in one month CL, PGE 2 production could be regulated by progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol, while, in <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL, this prostaglandin seems {{to be under the}} control of progesterone alone...|$|R

Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making.

At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, {{was charged}} in an influence-peddling scandal. The {{prosecution}} claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited {{a perception that}} he could influence the awarding of state contracts through his wife. It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2million with him. He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; {{he was given a}} sentence of five years <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> in federal prison, which was {{at the low end of}} the range prescribed by the federal sentencing guidelines. He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to testify in the trial, but was not charged. The scandal tarnished her image, however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction.

5|$|In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army {{based in}} Libya {{conducted}} the Italian invasion of Egypt <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> later, the British and Commonwealth {{troops of the}} Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn {{and sent to the}} Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped {{and in the case of}} the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.|$|E
5|$|One of six cricketing brothers, four of whom {{represented}} Victoria, Harvey {{followed his}} elder brother Merv into Test cricket {{and made his}} debut in January 1948, aged 19 <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> In his second match, he became the youngest Australian to score a Test century, a record that still stands. Harvey was {{the youngest member of}} the 1948 Invincibles of Don Bradman to tour England, {{regarded as one of the}} finest teams in history. After initially struggling in English conditions, he made a century on his Ashes debut. Harvey started his career strongly, with six centuries in his first thirteen Test innings at an average over 100, including four in 1949–50 against South Africa, including a match-winning 151 not out on a sticky wicket. As Bradman's team broke up in the 1950s due to retirements, Harvey became Australia's senior batsman, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1954, in recognition of his feat in scoring more than 2,000 runs during the 1953 tour of England.|$|E
