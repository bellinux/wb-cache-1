25|$|Vertical {{air mixing}} {{was invented by}} Erik Uppstu. His idea is to turn {{traditional}} vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved mixing results. Vertical air has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In vertical air mixing, primary air supply is arranged conventionally.

50|$|External mix nozzles {{contacts}} fluids {{outside the}} nozzle {{as shown in}} the schematic diagram. This type of spray nozzle may require more atomizing air and a higher atomizing air pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the atomizing air nozzles (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns. A flat pattern is formed with additional <b>air</b> <b>ports</b> to flatten or reshape the circular spray cross-section discharge.|$|E

5000|$|St. Clair Power Plant came {{online in}} August 1953, {{and was the}} largest in the DTE Energy network. At that time, its {{capacity}} was 652 MW. Later, units 5, 6 and 7 were added to meet growing demands for power in Metro Detroit, with St. Clair producing 1571 MW. After the completion of unit 7 in 1969, St. Clair Power Plant was the world's largest. [...] In the middle to late 1970s, the plant was converted to burn Western subbituminous coal. The conversion resulted in lower unit power ratings and necessitated the installation of larger electrostatic precipitators on Units 1-4 and Unit 6. This also included building a new stack for units 1-4. In addition, low NOx burners and overfire <b>air</b> <b>ports</b> have been installed on all of St. Clair's generating units.|$|E
