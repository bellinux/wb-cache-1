In collaboration with Leonard Bélanger, Leblond worked on increasing the resolution of the <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>technique.</b> They were advised by physicist Pierre Demers to melt the emulsion from Eastman Kodak lantern slides, paint it directly on the sections, and then develop the emulsion while it was still attached to the histologic sections. This resulted in a tenfold improvement in resolution. Subsequently, Leblond and his colleagues developed a technique in which the histologic slides were dipped directly into liquid emulsion. The use of thinner sections and emulsion coats led to further advances in resolution, and the introduction of tritium was a technical milestone.|$|E

Using <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> it was found that satellite cells in clenbuterol treated transplants began proliferating earlier than in control animals.

40|$|We {{have used}} <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> {{to examine the}} {{characteristics}} and distribution of the binding of reported selective M 2 muscarinic ligands and compared them with the distribution of cells expressing mRNAs for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptors. Our {{results suggest that the}} M 2 ligands {{used in the present study}} ([3 H]OXO-M, [3 H]AF-DX 384, AF-DX 116, methoctramine) also recognize M 4 receptors present in regions such as the striatum and olfactory tubercle. This is supported by 1) relative abundances of the different transcripts, with m 2 mRNA being very scarce and m 4 mRNA very abundant in these regions; 2) comparison of the pharmacological characteristics of M 2 -ligand binding sites in brain areas selected by their exclusive expression of M 2 receptors versus areas enriched in M 4 receptors. An important conclusion of these studies is that none of the muscarinic radioligands available at the present time appears to label specifically a single muscarinic receptor subtype population. Areas are suggested where <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> can be helpful in elucidating the subtype selectivity of existing and new ligands. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Three classes of protein were detected: early proteins, class I, which include a protein capable of shutting off host protein synthesis; class II, proteins which are detected after 30 min; and late proteins, class III, which include the phage-directed endolysin and five additional proteins that appear 45 min after infection...|$|R

Responses to LUV alone, LUV plus sunburn radiation, and sunburn radiation alone were evaluated both clinically and microscopically by routine histologic and <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques.</b> Observations revealed that contrary to previous accepted hypotheses, LUV rays have a striking augmentative effect on sunburn damage. In addition, although LUV radiation alone causes no discernable adverse clinical or histologic changes in skin, an effect on DNA metabolism does occur...|$|R
40|$|<b>Autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have been}} used to study the {{interaction}} of many facultative and obligate parasites, including viruses. After feeding the host plant with labelled substrates, labelled material accumu-lates in the infected cells and seems to penetrate into structures of the parasite. After labelling the parasite, its influence on the host may be studied. We use this technique to study the interaction of host (bean) and parasite (bean rust) during the infection process. After infection with uredospores labelled with tritiated orotic acid, the radioactivity is retained almost completely within the young haustorium at 22 h after inocu-lation. This may indicate a very small influence of the parasite on its compatible host. In incompatible host-parasite combinations, the infection process proceeds in a different way. The use of <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> to compare combinations of varying compatibilities will be discussed. Many autoradiographic studies indicate that the transport and the distribution of solutes in plants can be significantly altered by infection [1]. This has been shown in a number of obligate and facultative parasites, including viruses [2]. Generally, radioactive material accumulates in a zone around infection sites. Accumulation of labelled material seems to be caused by increased metabolic activity in and transport of labelled sub...|$|R

40|$|By using {{combined}} radioreceptor binding and <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques,</b> we {{were able}} to localize the GABA 'A' receptor agonist 3 H-muscimol in the rat choroid plexus. Within sections of rat choroid plexus, 3 H-muscimol was bound specifically with a KD of 37 nM and a Bmax of 253 pmol/mg tissue. These values are consistent with the labelling of GABA 'A' receptor sites. The autoradiographic studies demonstrated that 3 H-muscimol was attached to the epithelium of the choroid plexus. The blood vessels of the plexus did not exhibit specific labelling. Examination of these data suggests the existence of GABAergic mechanisms which control cerebrospinal fluid production or flow...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{in vitro}} radioreceptor binding and <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> with [3 H]SCH 23390 as a ligand {{were used to}} analyze the {{pharmacological}} profile and anatomical localization of dopamine D 1 receptor sites in sections of human umbilical artery. The ligand was bound to sections of the artery {{in a manner consistent with}} the labelling of D 1 receptors. These receptors, which show a fetal-to-maternal gradient with the highest concentration near the placenta, are located within the smooth muscle layer of the umbilical artery.

Anatomically, these receptor sites were located primarily within the smooth muscle of the renal vascular tree and to a lesser extent within cortical and medullary tubules.

40|$|The {{anatomical}} localization of {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} type A (GABA-A) receptor {{sites in the}} rat superior cervical ganglion was studied using combined radioreceptor binding and <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques.</b> 3 H-Muscimol {{was used as a}} ligand of GABA-A receptor sites. The binding was consistent with the labelling of GABA-A sites. The dissociation constant value was 6. 4 nmol/l, and the maximum density of binding sites was 146 +/- 7. 8 fmol/mg tissue. Light microscope autoradiography revealed the accumulation of 3 H-muscimol mainly in superior portions of the ganglion. Binding sites are located primarily in the neuropil rather than within ganglionic neurons. It is probable that the sites revealed by autoradiography are involved in the inhibition of acetylcholine release from ganglionic neurons...|$|R

The {{results show that}} the principal site of termination is the ipsilateral nucleus of the tractus solitarius with smaller projections to the contralateral tractus nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the area postrema and subpostrema. The fibres cross the midline via the commissural nucleus of Cajal. No evidence of vagal afferent fibres was found in the reticular formation, the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, the external cuneate nucleus or the dorsal horns of the first and second cervical spinal segments.

That vagal afferent fibres across the mid-line via the commissural nucleus of Cajal is confirmed. In addition, a second, more rostrally placed decussation of vagal afferent fibres is shown. Associated with this more rostral decussation is an area of termination of vagal afferent fibres in the contralateral ventromedial reticular formation. No direct projection of vagal afferent fibres to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus was seen...|$|E

Methotrexate inhibited deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA in both vaginal and rectal epithelium. Several lipid-soluble analogues of methotrexate were found to have no effect on deoxyuridine incorporation. Nitrogen mustard and emetine have been shown to selectively inhibit DNA and protein synthesis, respectively, without systemic effects.

40|$|Cellular {{response}} and cell population kinetics were studied during lymphopoiesis in the thymus {{of the mouse}} under continuous gamma irradiation using <b>autoradiographic</b> <b>techniques</b> and specific labeling with tritiated thymidine. On the basis of tissue weights, it is concluded that the response of both the thymus and spleen to continuous low dose-rate irradiation is multiphasic. That is, alternating periods of steady state growth, followed by collapse, {{which in turn is}} followed by another period of homeostasis. Since there are two populations of lymphocytes - short lived and long-lived, it may be that different phases of steady state growth are mediated by different lymphocytes.
