5|$|At this point, McCormack {{had become}} <b>apprehensive</b> about his career, but in early 1947 {{a new and}} {{exciting}} opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 had created the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee {{research and development of}} nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The Act had created a statutory position inside the AEC called the Director of Military Applications, which the AEC commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation. By law, the Director of Military Applications had to be a serving armed forces officer.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Nobel was {{astonished}} to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him <b>apprehensive</b> about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} <b>apprehensive</b> about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh's seven-year-old son, Gautham Krishna, {{was chosen}} to play the younger version of the protagonist in his Telugu cinema debut. According to Sukumar, Gautham looked like the actor did as a child. When the {{director}} approached Mahesh and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, Gautham Krishna was only six and they were <b>apprehensive.</b> His introduction scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein, since the boy was afraid of gunfire. Naveen Polisetty played a supporting role as Mahesh's friend in the film, and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist. Nassar, Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|Massasoit and Squanto were <b>apprehensive</b> {{about the}} Pilgrims. In Massasoit's first {{contact with the}} English, several men of his tribe {{had been killed in}} an unprovoked attack by English sailors. He also knew of the Pilgrims' theft of the corn stores in their {{landings}} at Provincetown. Squanto had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt. Robert Gorges. Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew of the ship and had taken in Squanto.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery and {{his troops}} {{spent the first}} night near the landing area, under light fire from the British guns. The next morning, he ordered Major Timothy Bedel to occupy a {{position}} north of the fort, but when Montgomery saw that his men were <b>apprehensive,</b> he chose to lead the mission himself. As Montgomery led his troops, they came upon a fight between British troops and another American party. Montgomery took command of the skirmish and forced the British party back into the fort. Montgomery sent Bedel with a force to entrench themselves about a mile north of the fort. Montgomery then put other troops around the fort and began a siege.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Bahadur Shah {{had grown}} <b>apprehensive</b> {{of the power}} of Humayun. He {{dispatched}} his chief officer Xacoes (Shah Khawjeh) to Nuno da Cunha with an offer to hand over the seven islands of Bombay together with Bassein, its dependencies, and revenues by sea and land. On 23 December 1534, the Treaty of Bassein was signed on board the galleon San Mateos (St. Matthew). Bassein and the seven islands of Bombay were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha on 25 October 1535, permanently ending the Islamic rule on the islands.|$|E
5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from him or her. For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were <b>apprehensive</b> about how the characters would fit in the finished product. Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E
5|$|The Mughal Empire, {{founded in}} 1526, was the {{dominant}} {{power in the}} Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century. Growing <b>apprehensive</b> {{of the power of}} the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} for {{the book}} is made of aluminium, which was Madonna's idea, and is spiral bound and enclosed in a Mylar sheet. Due to the scandalous nature of the photographs and the media mayhem surrounding it from the initial preview of the book, Madonna {{did not have to}} promote Sex, except for a pre-release party and some television specials. Her publishers were extremely <b>apprehensive</b> about the release as well as its commercial potential. Sex was released alongside her fifth studio album Erotica, which went on sale a day earlier.|$|E
5|$|When Mr. McGregor and {{his wife}} leave home in their gig, Benjamin Bunny and his cousin Peter Rabbit venture into Mr. McGregor's garden to {{retrieve}} the clothes Peter lost there in The Tale of Peter Rabbit. They find the blue jacket and brown shoes on a scarecrow, but Peter is <b>apprehensive</b> about lingering in the garden because of his previous experience. Benjamin delays their departure by gathering onions, which he wraps in Peter's handkerchief, hoping to give them to his aunt, Peter's mother. He then takes a casual stroll around the garden, followed by an increasingly nervous Peter.|$|E
5|$|Bombay, {{now called}} Mumbai, Bombaim in Portuguese, is the {{financial}} and commercial capital of India {{and one of the}} most populous cities in the world. At the time of arrival of the Portuguese, current Bombay was an archipelago of seven islands. Between the third century BCE and 1348, the islands came under the control of successive Hindu dynasties. The Muslim rulers of Gujarat, who had been ruling current Thane and Vasai for a few decades, annexed the islands in 1348, that were later governed by the Gujarat Sultanate from 1391 to 1534. Growing <b>apprehensive</b> of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the seven islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.|$|E
5|$|By 24 May, the Germans had {{captured}} {{the port of}} Boulogne and surrounded Calais. The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under Generalmajor Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk. On 23 May, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks {{and the question of}} supply to his forward troops. He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 percent). Hitler was also <b>apprehensive,</b> and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.|$|E
5|$|Frank Oz voices Yoda, the centuries-old {{leader of}} the Jedi Council who is <b>apprehensive</b> about {{allowing}} Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls. Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted In & Out. A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis portrays him in the scene in which Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight. Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough. On the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda {{similar to the one}} from the other prequels is used instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1526, the Portuguese {{established}} their factory at Bassein. During 1528–29, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio seized the fort of Mahim from the Gujarat Sultanate, when the King was {{at war with}} Nizam-ul-mulk, the emperor of Chaul, a town south of the islands. Bahadur Shah had grown <b>apprehensive</b> {{of the power of}} the Mughal emperor Humayun and he was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the islands of Mumbai and Bassein were offered to the Portuguese. Bassein and the seven islands were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha, Viceroy of Portuguese India, on 25 October 1535, ending the Islamic rule in Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted {{orders for}} MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese {{launched}} airstrikes originating from there against his forces. The next day Truman {{met with the}} chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was <b>apprehensive</b> about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Lewis is {{hired by}} Claudia Colby to {{accompany}} her to the Weatherfield Traders' Association Christmas party. Claudia introduces Lewis to her friend, Audrey Roberts, and he flirts with her. Audrey learns Lewis is a male escort and she later hires him to be her date for the Stylists' Dinner. Audrey contacts Lewis again and invites him {{to have dinner with}} her, but she becomes <b>apprehensive</b> and pretends to be ill when he arrives. Lewis persuades Audrey to let him into her home and he listens while she talks about her late husband. They then go out for dinner. Lewis visits the Rovers Return in Coronation Street and pretends not to know Audrey. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) recognises Lewis from the Christmas party and when he sees Lewis kissing Audrey, he jumps to the conclusion that they are having an affair.|$|E
5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the floor below the desks so Charles, who {{is sitting in the}} conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and <b>apprehensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the Union side, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Grant's {{superior}} {{as commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, was also <b>apprehensive.</b> Halleck had authorized Grant to capture Fort Henry, but now he felt that continuing to Fort Donelson was risky. Despite Grant's success to date, Halleck had little confidence in him, considering Grant to be reckless. Halleck attempted to convince his own rival, Don Carlos Buell, to take command of the campaign to get his additional forces engaged. Despite Johnston's high regard for Buell, the Union general was as passive as Grant was aggressive. Grant never suspected his superiors were considering relieving him, but he was well aware that any delay or reversal might be an opportunity for Halleck to lose his nerve and cancel the operation.|$|E
5|$|Riven {{combined}} the pre-rendered backgrounds with live action footage, {{in order to}} increase the player's immersion level. Riven was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was <b>apprehensive</b> about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of Atrus from Myst, even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by chroma key, so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with morphing, to allow for partial variations due to the nonlinearity of the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were <b>apprehensive</b> about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|These {{issues were}} would shape {{what would be}} known as Operation Claret. The best-trained British light {{infantry}} roamed the jungle, attacking Indonesian bases and patrols at will and trying to {{give the appearance of}} being everywhere at once as a psychological effect upon the enemy. Initially launched only over short distances, seaborne raids into peninsular Malaysia caused the range to be extended throughout 1964 and 1965. Walker continued the Claret raids to great effect until the end of his tenure, as he was replaced by Major General George Lea as commander of British forces in Borneo. Lea, however, had the bad fortune of being ordered to take command just as the conflict began to reach its climax in the spring of 1965. Sukarno, desperate for a decisive victory and <b>apprehensive</b> of the effect that the fruitless conflict was having upon his country, was beginning to order stronger attacks to win a decisive military victory and drive the British from the border lines.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been <b>apprehensive</b> about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which {{were also}} {{produced}} by Bay, Form, and Fullerit {{was decided that}} Friday the 13th {{would not be a}} period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s. In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th. Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel. Nispel was <b>apprehensive</b> about taking the job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project. Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.|$|E
5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some difficult choices. Grant's army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 men, might attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was <b>apprehensive</b> about {{the ease with which}} Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the fort). He was more concerned about the threat from Buell than he was from Grant, and suspected the river operations might simply be a diversion.|$|E
5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also <b>apprehensive</b> about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{games have}} an overall upbeat feeling. The typical Dragon Quest plot {{involves}} the player controlling {{a party of}} heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when, and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, to help ease players who may be <b>apprehensive</b> about whether {{they are on the}} right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced {{at the beginning of the}} game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.|$|E
5|$|In {{a memorable}} event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon's 39th {{birthday}} celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides. Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich's {{attendance at the}} Congress of Erfurt; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful. In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings {{about the possibility of}} Austria invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain. His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon, that Russia was unlikely to want to fight Austria, and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe. Back in Paris, Metternich was overtly <b>apprehensive</b> about his own safety. When Austria declared war on France, Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna, but the effects of this were minimal. He was allowed to leave France under escort for Austria in late May 1809. After Napoleon's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became {{alarmed by}} the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, {{particularly}} bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there. The next day Truman met with {{the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was <b>apprehensive</b> about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores. SAC did not intend to attack air bases and depots; the bombers would target industrial cities in North Korea and China. Deployments of SAC bombers to Guam continued {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|On his {{way back}} to home to join Sastry for a concert, Suryam helps a few victims of an {{accidental}} fire in Ramapuram. His absence leaves Sastry livid and he refuses to listen to any excuses. Sastry comes across Suryam and Lalitha as a couple, which widens the gap between them. While Gayathri is <b>apprehensive,</b> Udayam remains unaffected. On the way to another concert, Sastry refuses to help an injured lineman named Narayana. A disturbed Suryam emphasises that society's welfare is more important than worshipping music, which makes Sastry declare Charukesa his successor as a musician. Suryam confronts Sastry about this and leaves the house for good after an argument. Suryam meets Varalayya and stays in his client's house. Suryam later meets Narayana's widow and learns that the government has denied him compensation as he was drunk during working hours. He also meets the family of another drunkard named Kishtappa, one of the survivors of the fire. Their situation leaves Suryam disturbed, and he vows to abolish liquor in Ramapuram. Suryam and Lalitha begin their attempts to make the working class men abandon liquor consumption. Although initially successful, the plan backfires later.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially <b>apprehensive</b> about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E
5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still <b>apprehensive</b> about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E
