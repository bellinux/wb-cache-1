5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E
5|$|State Route364 (SR364) is a north–south state {{route in}} Ohio. It starts from SR705 near Yorkshire. The route moves north across several counties, then {{northeast}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Lake. SR 364 then travels west along a concurrency with SR 703, and ends at SR29 near St. Marys. The route was designated in1934, from SR 219 to SR 29. It was extended southwards to SR 705 in 1936 and completely paved by 1940. SR 364 was also extended in 1973 {{to the new}} alignment of SR 29.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
60|$|On {{the island}} a thrush {{had begun to}} sing. Molly raised her head, as if to listen. <b>The</b> water lapped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canoe.|$|R
60|$|Jephson arrived {{about nine}} {{o'clock in the}} ferry-boat. We were made acquainted with this fact by having our heads bumped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saloon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's the man, sir.' The maids and men {{sitting under}} the cows were all attentively {{listening}} to this discourse, milking irregularly, and softly directing <b>the</b> jets <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pail.|$|R
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
25|$|The main {{magazine}} was constructed of off-form concrete, with a corridor around three sides of two rooms that are built <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hill. Markings remain of the storage racks that held ammunition for the guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} {{depth of}} the game, however, derives {{to a large extent}} from blocking strategies designed to limit the opponent's mobility. It can be advantageous to pin one or more enemy checkers <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> board by moving in the second row or column.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick, Tantor!" [...] {{shouted the}} ape-man, {{and the beast}} swung him to his head. [...] "Hurry!" [...] and the mighty pachyderm lumbered off through the jungle, guided by kicking <b>of</b> naked heels <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> his head.|$|R
25|$|Rail anchors or Anticreepers are {{spring steel}} clips that {{attach to the}} {{underside}} of the rail baseplate and bear <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sleepers to prevent longitudinal movement of the rail, either from changes in temperature or through vibration.|$|R
50|$|Sidemounting stages: Sidemount stages is the {{practice}} of using sidemount configuration (bungee loops and/or buttplate rails) {{as a means for}} stowing stage/deco cylinders in a streamlined manner <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torso, when otherwise diving in back-mounted doubles or CCR.|$|R
25|$|After wartime {{experiences}} suggested improvements, Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft {{were given}} extra features to augment their air-sea rescue capability. One such invention {{was a small}} platform that could be braced <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the flying boat's hull to allow a team of two Catalina crewmen to lean out {{into the water and}} rescue a swimmer.|$|E
25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns Palaemon elegans are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants in mammals), they increase grooming and rubbing of the afflicted area <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tank; this reaction is inhibited by benzocaine (a local anaesthetic in mammals), even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic {{do not show}} reduced activity.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{provides}} {{visualization of}} the thoracic and abdominal structures, and can sometimes rule out or narrow down a diagnosis. Information {{that may be}} gleaned from ultrasonographic findings include the presence of sand, distention, entrapment, strangulation, intussusception, and wall thickening of intestinal loops, as well as diagnose nephrosplenic entrapment, peritonitis, abdominal tumors, and inguinal or scrotal hernias. Abdominal ultrasound requires an experienced operator to accurately diagnose the cause of colic. It may be applied <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the horse, as well as transrectally.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} {{the boys were}} eating, the small cakes <b>of</b> ice thumped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steamer. But this did no damage, although, as the {{professor}} explained, there was danger of some ice getting caught in the propeller.|$|R
60|$|He was {{conducted}} to the large council-room which was above the hall. There, the King was {{walking up and down}} anxiously, looking paler than his wont, and no wonder, for the uproar sounded tremendous there--and now and then a stone dashed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep window.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{was about}} to ride his frantic horse {{straight}} into the work-train. Desperately he hauled the horse up and leaped off. Larry was down, waiting, and his mount went plunging away. Bullets were pattering <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars, from which puffed streaks of flame and smoke.|$|R
25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns (Palaemon elegans) are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants), the animals show increased grooming and rubbing of the afflicted area <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tank. Furthermore, this reaction is inhibited {{by a local}} anaesthetic, even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic did not show reduced activity. Other scientists suggested the rubbing may reflect an attempt to clean the affected area as application of anaesthetic alone caused an increase in grooming.|$|E
25|$|To {{grip the}} ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam {{parallel}} to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and {{the third and fourth}} fingers close together and rest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
60|$|You cannot {{lean out}} of a German bed to pick up {{anything}} off the floor, owing to its box-like formation; {{so he has to}} scramble out after it, and of course every time he does this he barks both his shins twice <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed.|$|R
2500|$|Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} have {{a seemingly}} mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with traditional fishers. Fishers in India recall {{when they would}} call out to the dolphins, by tapping a wooden key {{also known as a}} [...] "lahai kway", <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> their boats, asking the Irrawaddys to drive fish into their nets.|$|R

25|$|The first rescue {{attempts}} were made {{on the following day}} when two tugboats tried to turn the stern of Sampo towards open water together with the icebreaker's own engine and rudder. However, the task was deemed impossible and the tugboats evacuated the pilot and the women working in the icebreaker's kitchen to Mäntyluoto. On 8 January Sampo was further damaged when the wind pushed a large ice floe <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the icebreaker and the waves began pounding her hull against the rocks. Both engine rooms flooded and the pumps stopped. In the following night Sampo slowly settled in the bottom, listing the partially submerged icebreaker approximately 20 degrees starboard. The remaining crew members were evacuated in heavy weather and freezing temperatures on the following day. The salvaging Sampo was awarded to the Finnish salvage company Neptun Oy, but the task was deemed impossible in the presence of ice.|$|E
500|$|Pugs {{have two}} {{distinct}} shapes for their ears, [...] "rose" [...] and [...] "button". [...] "Rose" [...] ears {{are smaller than}} the standard style of [...] "button" [...] ears, and are folded with the front edge <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the head. Breeding preference goes to [...] "button" [...] style ears.|$|E
500|$|The {{space between}} the rails was , and the {{carriages}} overhung the outside rails by [...] Pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the carriage, the remaining gap was just enough for Huskisson and Holmes to escape without injury, but Huskisson misjudged the distance. According to Edward Littleton, the Duke of Wellington said to Huskisson [...] "We {{seem to be going}} on—you had better step in!". Huskisson tried to clamber into the carriage, but those inside failed to reach him to pull him in. Holmes, still pressed against the carriage, shouted [...] "For God's sake, Mr Huskisson, be firm", but Huskisson grabbed the door of the carriage. With Holmes still pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the carriage, the door, with Huskisson hanging on to it, swung out directly into the path of Rocket. Rocket collided with the door and Huskisson fell onto the track in front of the locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The {{identity}} of the ISB features as stromatolites is controversial, because similar features may form through non-biological processes. However, apparent sand accumulation <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> putative stromatolites during their formation suggest that observed, dome-like features arose during the sedimentary process, and not through later, metamorphic deformation. This suggests the features are fossils of ancient stromatolites.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2009, a 5-year-old female orca named Skyla turned on an {{unidentified}} trainer while performing in one of Loro Parque Tenerife's daily shows. Skyla started pushing her trainer through the water and up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool. [...] "Water work" [...] has been suspended with her, and only senior trainers are allowed {{to work with her}} now.|$|R
5000|$|Wing Cheek: A {{relatively}} recent innovation in snaffle cheeks, the wing bit offers extensive protection {{at the corners}} of the horse’s mouth by having winged plates on the ends of the mouthpiece that curve around <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth. Essentially acting like a bit guard, these metal plates ensure that the rings of the bit do not rub or pinch <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse’s mouth.|$|R
500|$|Unable to maneuver, Chesapeake [...] "luffed up" [...] and her port stern quarter caught <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Shannon {{amidships}} and the {{two ships}} were lashed together. Confusion and disarray reigned {{on the deck of}} Chesapeake; Captain Lawrence tried rallying a party to board Shannon, but the bugler failed to sound the call. At this point a shot from a sniper mortally wounded Lawrence; as his men carried him below, he gave his last order: [...] "Don't give up the ship. Fight her till she sinks." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{helicopter}} winches Homer out, slamming {{his head}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the gorge {{several times in}} the process before he is loaded into a waiting ambulance, which immediately crashes into a tree as it starts to leave for the hospital. The gurney carrying Homer rolls out of the back, and he once again falls {{to the floor of the}} canyon. Having arrived at the hospital he is put in the same ward next to Lance Murdock, where he tells him, [...] "You think you've got guts, try raising my kids." ...|$|E
500|$|In Charleston Harbor, Army Captain Francis D. Lee, {{supported}} by General P. G. T. Beauregard, developed {{a small boat}} that would carry a spar torpedo. His craft, known as , successfully exploded a torpedo <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> , severely damaging her. Later, the more famous [...] used one of Lee's spar torpedoes to sink , the first ship to be sunk by a submarine. The Navy Department had not provided active support for Lee's experiments, but their successful result led {{to the use of}} spar torpedoes on ships throughout the fleet. (Less favorably for the Rebel cause, spar torpedoes were also immediately adopted by the Union Navy, and one was used in October 1864 to sink the ironclad [...]) ...|$|E
50|$|A hold fast {{is shaped}} like a shepherd's hook. In use, the shank fits loosely into a hole in <b>the</b> top or <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bench and {{the tip of the}} hook is pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> work. The hold fast is set by rapping the top with a mallet, which causes the shaft to wedge <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hole. It is {{released}} by hitting <b>the</b> back <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|Support scull is {{performed}} by holding <b>the</b> upper arms <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{body and the}} fore arms at 90-degree angles to the body, with hands facing {{the bottom of the}} pool. The fore arms are then moved back and forth while maintaining the right angle. <b>The</b> resulting pressure <b>against</b> <b>the</b> hands allows the swimmer to hold their legs above water while upside down.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the bearing}} joint, the bolt itself limits lateral {{movement}} of the elements by the shank of the bolt bearing upon <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holes in the clamped elements. [...] Such joints require less clamping force, because {{a high level of}} friction between the clamped surfaces is not required. The clearance between the bolt and the holes means that some lateral movement may occur before <b>the</b> bolt bears <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holes.|$|R
