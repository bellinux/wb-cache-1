5|$|Many animals {{alternate}} between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle. <b>Arousal</b> <b>and</b> alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by {{a network of}} brain areas.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

Polysomnographic monitoring demonstrates normal sleep latency, a normal number of <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> awakenings, and normal sleep duration {{with or without}} a multiple sleep latency test that demonstrates a mean sleep latency of greater than 10 minutes. No medical or mental disorder produces the complaint. Other sleep disorders producing insomnia are not present to a degree that would explain the patient’s complaint.|$|R
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited.

In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between <b>arousal</b> level <b>and</b> blink rate {{has not yet}} been clarified. One of the causes is a difference of the task done by previous study. Visual tasks greatly influence blink rate, therefore, it is necessary to examine the {{relation between}} <b>arousal</b> level <b>and</b> blink rate as it pertains to vision. In this study, the relation between <b>arousal</b> level <b>and</b> blink rate was examined through testing the effects that performing visual task and non-visual task (auditory task) had on 12 university students. The index of arousal level was an electroencephalogram (α-index). As a result of the experiment, we proposed hypothesis relating <b>arousal</b> level <b>and</b> blink rate. In this hypothesis, the blink rate decreases as arousal level decreases when arousal level decreases below a certain level. However, with visual tasks, the blink rate tends to temporarily increase as <b>arousal</b> level decrease. <b>And,</b> we also proposed extended hypothesis. In this hypothesis, when arousal level increases markedly, the blink rate also increases...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Prematurely born {{compared}} with term born infants are {{at increased risk}} of sudden infant death syndrome, particularly if slept prone. The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis that preterm infants with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia being prepared for neonatal unit discharge would sleep longer <b>and</b> have less <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> more central apneas in the prone position. METHODS. This was a prospective observational study in a tertiary NICU. Twenty-four infants (14 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) with a median gestational age of 27 weeks were studied at a median postconceptional age of 37 weeks. Video polysomnographic recordings of 2 -channel electroencephalogram, 2 -channel electro-oculogram, nasal airflow, chest and abdominal wall movements, limb movements, electrocardiogram, and oxygen saturation were made in the supine and prone positions, each position maintained for 3 hours. The duration of sleep, sleep efficiency (total sleep time/total recording time), and number and type of apneas, <b>arousals,</b> <b>and</b> awakenings were recorded. RESULTS. Overall, in the prone position, infants slept longer, had greater sleep efficiency (89. 5 % vs 72. 5 %), and had more central apneas (median: 5. 6 vs 2. 2), but fewer obstructive apneas (0. 5 vs 0. 9). The infants had more awakenings (9. 7 vs 3. 5) <b>and</b> <b>arousals</b> per hour (13. 6 vs 9. 0) when supine. There were similar findings in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia infants. CONCLUSIONS. Very prematurely born infants studied before neonatal unit discharge sleep more efficiently with fewer <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> more central apneas in the prone position, emphasizing the importance of recommending supine sleeping after neonatal unit discharge for prematurely born infants...|$|R
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and <b>arousal,</b> <b>and</b> observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
40|$|The arousal {{value of}} a {{stimulus}} influences its salience, whereby higher arousal should lead to faster processing. However, in previous research, participants consistently made faster valence judgments for low arousal, pleasant stimuli than for high arousal, pleasant stimuli. The speed of valence <b>and</b> <b>arousal</b> judgments for pictures and words were investigated in three experiments. Valence judgments were faster for low arousal than for high <b>arousal</b> pleasant pictures <b>and</b> for high <b>arousal</b> than for low <b>arousal</b> unpleasant pictures <b>and</b> words. Moreover, <b>arousal</b> judgments were faster for low arousal than high <b>arousal</b> pleasant <b>and</b> for high <b>arousal</b> than low <b>arousal</b> unpleasant pictures <b>and</b> words. The current research confirms {{that the impact of}} valence <b>and</b> <b>arousal</b> on processing speed does not reflect on the labels (valence versus arousal) used when recording speeded judgments. Similarly to valence, stimulus arousal interacts differentially with the evaluation of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli producing a processing advantage for high arousal, unpleasant stimuli but not high arousal, pleasant stimuli...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSleep in {{patients}} with Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) is frequently interrupted with arousals. Increased amounts of arousals result in shortening total sleep time and repeated sleep-arousal change can result in sleep fragmentation. According to the American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA) an arousal is a marker of sleep disruption representing a detrimental and harmful feature for sleep. The nature of <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> its role on the regulation of the sleep process raises controversy and has sparked {{the debate in the}} last years. In this work, we analyzed and compared the EEG spectral content of respiratory <b>and</b> spontaneous <b>arousals</b> on a database of 45 SAHS subjects. A total of 3980 <b>arousals</b> (1996 respiratory <b>and</b> 1984 spontaneous) were analyzed. The results showed no differences between the spectral content of the two kinds of arousals. Our findings raise doubt as to whether these two kinds of arousals are truly triggered by different organic mechanisms. Furthermore, they may also challenge the current beliefs regarding the underestimation of the importance of spontaneous <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> their contribution to sleep fragmentation {{in patients}} suffering from SAHS...|$|R

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon <b>arousal,</b> <b>and,</b> upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual <b>arousal</b> <b>and</b> orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The {{propensity}} to arouse from sleep is an integrative {{part of the}} sleep structure and can have direct implications in various clinical conditions. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the maturation of spontaneous arousals {{during the first year of}} life in healthy infants. DESIGN: Nineteen infants were studied with nighttime polysomnography on 3 occasions: aged 2 to 3 months, 5 to 6 months, and 8 to 9 months. Ten infants with a median age of 3 weeks were added to the main study to assess the maturation of arousals from birth. The infants were born full-term, were healthy at the time of study, and had no history of apnea. Sleep-state and cardiorespiratory parameters were scored according to recommended criteria. Arousals were differentiated into subcortical activations or cortical arousals, according to the presence of autonomic and/or electroencephalographic changes. Frequencies of subcortical activations <b>and</b> cortical <b>arousals</b> were studied at different ages in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. RESULTS: During sleep time, the frequency of total <b>arousals,</b> cortical <b>arousals,</b> <b>and</b> subcortical activations decreased with age. The maturation of the arousal events differed according to sleep states <b>and</b> types of <b>arousals.</b> With age, cortical arousals increased in REM sleep (P = 0. 006) and decreased in NREM sleep (P = 0. 01). Subcortical activations decreased with age in REM (P < 0. 001) and NREM sleep (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: During total sleep time, the frequency of cortical <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> subcortical activations decreased with maturation. However, the maturation process was different between cortical <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> subcortical activations. This finding suggests a difference in the maturational sequence of the different brain centers regulating arousals...|$|R

40|$|Objective Fatigue is an {{important}} and often underempha-sized symptom in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep fragmentation, i. e., <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> disruptions in sleep architecture, is common in patients with OSA and may potentially contribute to their fatigue. We hypothesized that <b>arousal</b> frequency <b>and</b> changes in sleep architecture contribute to the fatigue experienced by patients with OSA. Design Seventy-three patients with diagnosed but untreated OSA (AHI≥ 15) were enrolled in this study. A baseline polysomnogram was obtained, and fatigue was measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-short form (MFSI-sf). We evaluated the association between fatigue <b>and</b> <b>arousals</b> <b>and</b> various polysomongraphic varia-bles, including sleep stages and sleep efficiency. Results Significant correlations between MFSI-sf subscale scores <b>and</b> various <b>arousal</b> indices were noted. Emotional fatigue scores were associated with total arousal index (r= 0. 416, p=. 021), respiratory movement arousal index (r= 0. 346, p=. 025), <b>and</b> spontaneous movement <b>arousal</b> index (r= 0. 378, p=. 025). Physical fatigue scores were associated with total arousal index (r= 0. 360, p=. 033) <b>and</b> respiratory movement <b>arousal</b> index (r= 0. 304, p=. 040). Percent of stage 1 sleep and REM sleep were also associated with physical and emotional fatigue scores. Hierarchal linear regression analysis demonstrated that emotional fatigue scores were independently associated with spontaneous movement arousals after controlling for age, body mass index, depression, and sleep apnea severity.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of music is}} a visceral {{part of the human}} experience and its influence on cognitive function has become a growing area of research in psychology. In particular, perceptual properties of music (mood <b>and</b> <b>arousal)</b> have been shown to significantly affect performance. There has been minimal research in the field on the interaction of these perceptual properties and their influence on attentional processes. This research study focused on the effects of musical mood <b>and</b> musical <b>arousal</b> on visual attention. Given that music is a highly subjective experience, participants were asked to rate different music clips on independent dimensions of music <b>and</b> <b>arousal.</b> Following these ratings, the clips which participants rated highest and lowest on dimensions of mood (positive <b>and</b> negative) <b>and</b> <b>arousal</b> (low <b>and</b> high) were combined to produce individualized stimuli datasets for use in the next task. Participants were then asked to perform the Posner cueing paradigm while either exposed to silence or music clips. Results indicated that musical mood <b>and</b> musical <b>arousal</b> had no significant effect on performance in contrast to a significant interaction between the variables. Their combination produced the highest levels of performance for high <b>arousal</b> positive mood <b>and</b> lowest performance for low arousal negative mood. Intermediate performance was found for high <b>arousal</b> negative mood <b>and</b> low <b>arousal</b> positive mood conditions.
