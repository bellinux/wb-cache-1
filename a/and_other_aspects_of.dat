Beginning in Italy, and spreading {{to the rest of}} Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.|$|E
5|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) {{is another}} {{midbrain}} area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection. The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Mesocorticolimbic neurons {{play a central role}} in reward <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> motivation.|$|E

He reached the rank of commander—a rank he subsequently gave to his fictional creation—and was the planner for special operations unit 30th Assault Unit. Many of Bond's tastes and traits were Fleming's own, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's, as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring his creator's. Fleming used the experiences of his espionage career <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{social impact}} of {{television}} in Croatia {{is considered to}} be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for non-governmental organizations to communicate their concerns to the public and to criticize the government <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> politics of Croatia. Television is the most widespread source of information in Croatiaon average 57% of the population of Croatia uses television as their primary source of information.

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{lived in}} a lush {{floodplain}} environment {{along the edge of}} an inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs. In some areas, Gorgosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Daspletosaurus. Although these animals were roughly the same size, there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its ontogeny, life history <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> its biology.|$|E

5|$|Ijaz {{attained}} {{the rank}} of Full Professor of Physics in 1977, and during the same year served as acting head of the Physics department. After several foreign sabbaticals in the 1980s, the first at U.P.M. in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia from 1979 until 1981 and another at I.C.T.P. in 1985, he continued his teaching duties at Virginia Tech until retirement in December 1991 as Professor Emeritus of Physics. During {{the latter part of}} his career, Ijaz published papers that focused on methods and results in teaching, religion and science <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> physics that did not form part of his technical research in earlier years. Also a physicist and teaching researcher at Virginia Tech, Lubna Razia Ijaz established a scholarship in 1996 that is awarded to students involved in physics education.|$|E
5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|Luna, repenting for his blunder {{during the}} end of the first phase during Philippine Revolution, which ended at the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, then {{prepared}} himself for the second phase. Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E

He was accused of being antisemitic. One {{of the goals of}} the civil rights movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the political process.

After much soul-searching, the Executive Committee {{agreed to do}} so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation of the village began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties. In addition, scientific research began on the feral Soay sheep population <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the natural environment. In 1957 the area was designated a national nature reserve.|$|E

In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet propaganda-motivated {{support for}} Polish-language {{cultural}} activities, however, {{clashed with the}} official policy of Russification. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish from schools, street signs, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> life. This policy was, however, reversed at times—first before the elections in October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of France. In November 1940, the Poles of Lwów observed the 85th anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz's death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the German invasion of the Soviet Union; as a result Stalin permitted the creation of Polish forces in the East and later decided to create a Communist People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
