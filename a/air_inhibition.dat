In this paper, we present a number of new polyols acting as chain transfer crosslinkers and flexibilizers as main function. But they also bring other benefits like improved adhesion and rheology of different inks. These benefits are highlighted using different substrates and ink formulations...|$|E

40|$|A physical-chemical model {{which is}} an {{extension}} of that of Hong and Carmichael (1983) is used to investigate the role of formaldehyde in cloud chemistry. This model takes into account the mass transfer of SO 2, O 3, NH 3, HNO 3, H 2 O 2, CO 2, HCl, HCHO, O 2, OH and HO 2 into cloud droplets and their subsequent chemical reactions. The model is used to assess the importance of S(IV) -HCHO adduct formation, the reduction of H 2 O 2 by HCHO, HCHO-free radical interactions, and the formation of HCOOH in the presence of HCHO in cloud droplets. Illustrative calculations indicate that the presence of HCHO inhibits sulfate production rate in cloud droplets. The direct inhibition of sulfate production rate in cloudwater due to nucleophilic addition of HSO 3 (-) to HCHO(aq) to form hydroxymethanesulfonate is generally low for concentrations of HCHO typical of ambient <b>air.</b> However, <b>inhibition</b> of sulfate production due to formaldehyde-free radical interactions in solution can be important.

40|$|International audienceFerric uptake {{regulation}} protein (Fur) is {{a bacterial}} global regulator that uses iron as a cofactor to bind to specific DNA sequences. The function of Fur {{is not limited}} to iron homeostasis. A wide variety of genes involved in various mechanisms such as oxidative and acid stresses are under Fur control. Flavohemoglobin (Hmp) is an NO-detoxifying enzyme induced by NO and nitrosothiol compounds. Fur recently was found to regulate hmp in Salmonella typhimurium, and in Escherichia coli, the iron-chelating agent 2, 2 '-dipyridyl induces hmp expression. We now establish direct inhibition of E. coli Fur activity by NO. By using chromosomal Fur-regulated lacZ reporter fusion in E. coli, Fur activity is switched off by NO at micromolar concentration. In vitro Fur DNA-binding activity, as measured by protection of restriction site in aerobactin promoter, is directly sensitive to NO. NO reacts with Fe(II) in purified FeFur protein to form a S = 12 low-spin FeFur-NO complex with a g = 2. 03 EPR signal. Appearance of the same EPR signal in NO-treated cells links nitrosylation of the iron with Fur inhibition. The nitrosylated Fur protein is still a dimer and is stable in anaerobiosis but slowly decays in <b>air.</b> This <b>inhibition</b> probably arises from a conformational switch, leading to an inactive dimeric protein. These data establish a link between control of iron metabolism and the response to NO effects...|$|R
40|$|Benzotriazole (BTAH) {{has been}} used as a {{corrosion}} inhibitor for copper and copper-, based alloys for more than 40 years. It has been successfully employed for the, prevention of both atmospheric corrosion and particularly for the protection of, copper under immersed conditions. Whilst BTAH is an excellent inhibitor in alkaline, solution its efficiency drops off markedly as the pH decreases. It was hypothesized, that a possible way to increase surface adsorption and subsequent better inhibition, over a wide pH range might be through the preparation of derivatives, particularly, carboxybenzotriazoles and alkyl esters of these compounds. In this work the following techniques: weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic, polarisation, SERS spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and, coulometry were employed to investigate the inhibition efficiency of 4 - and 5 -, carboxybenzotriazole and their alkyl ester for copper corrosion. Molecular modelling, was also investigated as a tool for inhibitor design. Studies on 4 - and 5 - carboxybenzotriazole (CBT) showed that the inhibition, efficiency for copper corrosion in aerated acidic sulphate solution of each isomer was, pH, concentration and time dependant. At lower pH the 5 -isomer is the better, inhibitor and this behaviour continues at higher pH. The anti-tarnishing test showed, that whilst both isomers exhibited these properties, 5 -CBT was once again the, superior inhibitor. It was found that a commercial mixture of the octyl esters of 4 - and 5 -, carboxybenzotriazole inhibits copper corrosion in sulphate environments open to <b>air.,</b> The <b>inhibition</b> efficiency of the ester mixture at the lx 10 - 4 M level (pH - 0) is 98...|$|R
40|$|Aspirin (ASA) {{triggers}} a switch in the biosynthesis of lipid mediators, inhibiting prostanoid production and initiating 15 -epi-lipoxin generation through the acetylation of cyclooxygenase II. These aspirin-triggered lipoxins (ATL) may mediate some of ASA’s beneficial actions and therefore {{are of interest}} in the search for novel antiinflammatories that could manifest fewer unwanted side effects. Here, we report that design modifications to native ATL structure prolong its biostability in vivo. In mouse whole blood, ATL analogs protected at carbon 15 [15 (R/S) -methyl-lipoxin A 4 (ATLa 1) ] and the omega end [15 -epi- 16 -(para-fluoro) -phenoxy-LXA 4 (ATLa 2) ] were recoverable to ≈ 90 and 100 % at 3 hr, respectively, compared with a ≈ 40 % loss of native lipoxin A 4. ATLa 2 retains bioactivity and, at levels as low as ≈ 24 nmol/mouse, potently inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-induced leukocyte recruitment into the dorsal <b>air</b> pouch. <b>Inhibition</b> was evident by either local intra-air pouch delivery (≈ 77 % inhibition) or systemic delivery by intravenous injection (≈ 85 % inhibition) and proved more potent than local delivery of ASA. Rank order for inhibiting polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration was: ATLa 2 (10 μg, i. v.) ≈ATLa 2 (10 μg, local) ≈dexamethasone (10 μg, local) >ASA (1. 0 mg, local). Applied topically to mouse ear skin, ATLa 2 also inhibited polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration induced by leukotriene B 4 (≈ 78 % inhibition) or phorbol ester (≈ 49 % inhibition), which initiates endogenous chemokine production. These results indicate that this fluorinated analog of natural aspirin-triggered lipoxin A 4 is bioavailable by either local or systemic delivery routes and is a more potent and precise inhibitor of neutrophil accumulation than is ASA...|$|R

Alumina is a promising coating material. The development of corrosion resistant alumina coatings for BeO spheres is described, and results of corrosion, accelerated corrosion and neutron irradiation tests are presented. The limitations of the coating are discussed in detail Porous coatings can fail by 'undermining', but dense coatings are probably satisfactory for at least two years' operation out-of-pile at 1200 ºC and for much longer times at lower temperatures. Satisfactory operation at 1200 ºC for one year has been proved in a long term test. The eventual failure mechanism will probably be associated with the growth of a two layer reaction zone. Neutron irradiation tests indicate that a dose of 1020 nvt and possibly 1. 6 — 2 x 102 º nvt should be acceptable for retention of coating-to-BeO bond during simultaneous exposure above 500 - 700 ºC to fast neutrons and moist air...|$|R

The aim of our research is the identification and rationalization of the chemical reactions responsible for VOC removal. Model hydrocarbons, n-hexane and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane (i-octane), were used to characterize the process and compare the effects of DC corona polarity and of humidity on its energy efficiency and products. n-Hexane and i-octane behave very similarly. For both, the energy efficiency is significantly better with negative than with positive DC corona, especially in humid air. The effect of humidity is most interesting. Thus, while with −DC corona the process efficiency is significantly better in humid <b>air,</b> a slight <b>inhibition</b> is observed with +DC corona. Differences between +DC and −DC corona are {{also found in the}} amounts of volatile products formed, which include CO 2, CO, and minor quantities of organic byproducts (aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and lower hydrocarbons).

Aerodynamics, air preheat conditions, and overall excess air conditions were varied {{to determine their}} role on any such interaction. Results indicated that addition of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) to natural gas flames could enhance or inhibit NO emissions. Local flame stoichiometry and temperature, which were influenced by fuel injector type, determined which effect was observed {{and the extent to}} which it occurred. Thiophen (C₄H₄S) and pyridine (C₅H₅N) were added to # 2 diesel oil to determine effects of fuel sulfur on conversion of chemically bound fuel nitrogen to No. No discernible effect was observed at "zero" air preheat conditions. No emissions were enhanced at high air preheat conditions. Addition of SO₂ to natural gas flames doped with ammonia (NH₃) produced a significant increase in conversion of NH₃ to NO at high <b>air</b> preheat conditions. <b>Inhibition</b> effects were explained in terms of homogeneous catalysis of recombination reactions by SO₂.

40|$|In the dark, all {{decarboxylation}} {{reactions are}} associated with the oxidase reactions of mitochondrial electron transport. In the light, photorespiration is also active in photosynthetic cells. In winter rye (Secale cereale L.), cold hardening resulted in a 2 -fold increase in the rate of dark respiratory CO 2 release from leaves compared with nonhardened (NH) controls. However, in the light, NH and cold-hardened (CH) leaves had comparable rates of oxidase decarboxylation and total intracellular decarboxylation. Furthermore, whereas CH leaves showed similar rates of total oxidase decarboxylation in the dark and light, NH leaves showed a 2 -fold increase in total oxidase activity in the light compared with the dark. Light suppressed oxidase decarboxylation of end products of photosynthesis 2 -fold in NH leaves and 3 -fold in CH leaves in air. However, in high-CO 2, light did not suppress the oxidase decarboxylation of end products. Thus, the decrease in oxidase decarboxylation of end products observed in the light and in <b>air</b> reflected glycolate-cycle-related <b>inhibition</b> of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. We also showed that the glycolate cycle was involved in the decarboxylation of the end products of photosynthesis in both NH and CH leaves, suggesting a flow of fixed carbon out of the starch pool in the light...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of spore {{germination}} in the fern Onoclea sensibilis L. {{was investigated}} by applying CO 2 alone and {{in combination with}} ethylene. Sterile spores were sown aseptically on Knops solution in loosely capped culture tubes, enclosed individually in 2 -liter chambers, and grown under continuous white light. When maintained in enclosed containers with the ethylene-absorbent mercuric perchlorate and with atmospheres enriched up to 2 % CO 2 (v/v), spores germinated without any inhibition. Higher levels of applied CO 2 were progressively inhibitory. Inhibition by CO 2 was reversible. When CO 2 was permitted to escape and spores were exposed subsequently to ambient laboratory <b>air,</b> recovery from <b>inhibition</b> occurred within 48 hours. Also, inhibition by CO 2 was specific, since {{the same degree of}} inhibition resulted regardless of whether spores were treated with exogenous CO 2 for 48, 72, or 96 hours. The effect on germination of 1 μl/l added ethylene depended upon the amount of applied CO 2. When containers of KOH were enclosed and ambient CO 2 was absorbed, inhibition of germination by 1 μl/l exogenous ethylene was 90 %. When CO 2 was applied in concentrations from 0. 25 to 1. 0 % (v/v), CO 2 increasingly antagonized the inhibitory action of 1 μl/l added ethylene. Thus, photoinduced germination of spores was regulated by competitively interacting levels of CO 2 and ethylene...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hyperoxia {{is shown}} to impair airway {{relaxation}} via limiting L-arginine bioavailability to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and reducing NO production as a consequence. L-arginine can also be synthesized by L-citrulline recycling. The role of L-citrulline supplementation was investigated in the reversing of hyperoxia-induced impaired relaxation of rat tracheal smooth muscle (TSM). Methods Electrical field stimulation (EFS, 2 – 20 [*]V) -induced relaxation was measured under in vitro conditions in preconstricted tracheal preparations obtained from 12 [*]day old rat pups exposed to room air or hyperoxia (> 95 % oxygen) for 7 [*]days supplemented with L-citrulline or saline (in vitro or in vivo). The role of the L-citrulline/L-arginine cycle under basal conditions was studied by incubation of preparations {{in the presence of}} argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) inhibitor [α-methyl-D, L-aspartate, 1 [*]mM] or argininosuccinate lyase inhibitor (ASL) succinate (1 [*]mM) and/or NOS inhibitor [N ω -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; 100 [*]μM] with respect to {{the presence or absence of}} L-citrulline (2 [*]mM). Results Hyperoxia impaired the EFS-induced relaxation of TSM as compared to room air control (p[*]; 0. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 1 % at 2 [*]V to 50. 6 [*]±[*] 5. 7 % at 20 [*]V in hyperoxic group: 0. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 2 at 2 [*]V to 80. 0 [*]±[*] 5. 6 % at 20 [*]V in room <b>air</b> group). <b>Inhibition</b> of ASS or ASL, and L-citrulline supplementation did not affect relaxation responses under basal conditions. However, inhibition of NOS significantly reduced relaxation responses (p[*] in vivo and in vitro also reversed the hyperoxia-impaired relaxation. The differences were significant (p; 0. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 3 % at 2 [*]V to 47. 1 [*]±[*] 4. 1 % at 20 [*]V without L-citrulline; 0. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 3 % at 2 [*]V to 68. 2 [*]±[*] 4. 8 % at 20 [*]V with L-citrulline). Inhibition of ASS or ASL prevented this effect of L-citrulline. Conclusion The results indicate the presence of an L-citrulline/L-arginine cycle in the airways of rat pups. L-citrulline recycling does not play a major role under basal conditions in airways, but it has an important role under conditions of substrate limitations to NOS as a source of L-arginine, and L-citrulline supplementation reverses the impaired relaxation of airways under hyperoxic conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{new method}} is {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} entire life cycle of shallow cumuli in large eddy simulations. Although trained observers have no problem in distinguishing the different life stages of a cloud, this process proves difficult to automate, because cloud-splitting and cloud-merging events complicate the distinction between a single system divided in several cloudy parts and two independent systems that collided. Because the human perception is well equipped to capture and {{to make sense of}} these time-dependent three-dimensional features, a combination of automated constraints and human inspection in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment is used to select clouds that are exemplary in their behavior throughout their entire life span. Three specific cases (ARM, BOMEX, and BOMEX without large-scale forcings) are analyzed in this way, and the considerable number of selected clouds warrants reliable statistics of cloud properties conditioned on the phase in their life cycle. The most dominant feature in this statistical life cycle analysis is the pulsating growth that is present throughout the entire lifetime of the cloud, independent of the case and of the large-scale forcings. The pulses are a self-sustained phenomenon, driven by a balance between buoyancy and horizontal convergence of dry <b>air.</b> The convective <b>inhibition</b> just above the cloud base plays a crucial role as a barrier for the cloud to overcome in its infancy stage, and as a buffer region later on, ensuring a steady supply of buoyancy into the cloud.

The scrubber was made from a glass tube filled with glass beads (diam. 3 mm) and filled with approx. 5 ml of butyrylcholinesterase in a phosphate buffer of pH 7. 4. The air sample was bubbled through this solution for 20 s at a flow rate of 80 l hour- 1. Thereafter 8 microl of the enzyme solution were aspirated into the micro-SIA-LOV analyzer and the activity of the enzymes were evaluated by using Ellman’s reagent, i. e. 2. 5 mmol l- 1 butyrylthiocholine iodide and 0. 25 mmol 5, 5 ’-dithiobis (2 -nitrobenzoic acid).

40|$|Carbamoyl {{phosphate}} is {{a precursor}} for both arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. In Lactobacillus plantarum, carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized from glutamine, ATP, {{and carbon dioxide}} by two sets of identified genes encoding carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPS). The expression of the carAB operon (encoding CPS-A) responds to arginine availability, whereas pyrAaAb (encoding CPS-P) {{is part of the}} pyrR 1 BCAaAbDFE operon coding for the de novo pyrimidine pathway repressed by exogenous uracil. The pyr operon is regulated by transcription attenuation mediated by a trans-acting repressor that binds to the pyr mRNA attenuation site in response to intracellular UMP/phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate pools. Intracellular pyrimidine triphosphate nucleoside pools were lower in mutant FB 335 (carAB deletion) harboring only CPS-P than in the wild-type strain harboring both CPS-A and CPS-P. Thus, CPS-P activity is the limiting step in pyrimidine synthesis. FB 335 is unable to grow in the presence of uracil {{due to a lack of}} sufficient carbamoyl phosphate required for arginine biosynthesis. Forty independent spontaneous FB 335 -derived mutants that have lost regulation of the pyr operon were readily obtained by their ability to grow in the presence of uracil and absence of arginine; 26 harbored mutations in the pyrR 1 -pyrB loci. One was a prototroph with a deletion of both pyrR 1 and the transcription attenuation site that resulted in large amounts of excreted pyrimidine nucleotides and increased intracellular UTP and CTP pools compared to wild-type levels. Low pyrimidine-independent expression of the pyr operon was obtained by antiterminator site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting AE 1023 strain had reduced UTP and CTP pools and had the phenotype of a high-CO 2 -requiring auxotroph, since it was able to synthesize sufficient arginine and pyrimidines only in CO 2 -enriched <b>air.</b> Therefore, growth <b>inhibition</b> without CO 2 enrichment may be due to low carbamoyl phosphate pools from lack of CPS activity...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that air pollution has detrimental effects on both human health {{as well as the}} environment. Exposure to ozone and particulate matter pollution, is associated with an increase in cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity. Asthmatics, elderly and children have been indicated as especially sensitive groups. With a global increase in use of vehicles and industry, ambient air pollution represents a crucial health concern as well as a political, economical and environmental dilemma. Both ozone (O 3) and diesel exhaust (DE) trigger oxidative stress and inflammation in the airways, causing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing and reduced lung function. The aim of this thesis was to further examine which pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that are initiated in the airways by ozone, as compared to diesel exhaust. Furthermore, to study the effects of these two ambient air pollutants in a sequential exposure, thus mimicking an urban profile. In order to investigate this in healthy as well as asthmatic subjects, walk-in exposure chambers were utilized and various airway compartments were studied by obtaining induced sputum, endobronchial biopsies, or airway lavage fluids. In asthmatic subjects, exposure to 0. 2 ppm of O 3 induced an increase in the cytokines IL 5, GM-CSF and ENA- 78 in the bronchial epithelium six hours post-exposure. The healthy subjects, however, displayed no elevations of bronchial epithelial cytokine expression in response to the ozone exposure. The heightened levels of neutrophil chemoattractants and Th 2 cytokines in the asthmatic airway epithelium may contribute to symptom exacerbations following air pollution exposure. When examining an earlier time point post O 3 exposure (1 ½ hours), healthy subjects exhibited a suppression of IL- 8 {{as well as of the}} transcription factors NFκB and c-jun in the bronchial epithelium, as opposed to after filtered <b>air</b> exposure. This <b>inhibition</b> of early signal transduction in the bronchial epithelium after O 3 differs from the response detected after exposure to DE. Since both O 3 and DE are associated with generating airway neutrophilia as well as causing direct oxidative damage, it raises the query of whether daily exposure to these two air pollutants creates a synergistic or additive effect. Induced sputum attained from healthy subjects exposed in sequence to 0. 2 ppm of O 3 five hours following DE at a PM concentration of 300 µg/m 3, demonstrated significantly increased neutrophils, and elevated MPO levels, as compared to the sequential DE and filtered air exposure. O 3 and DE interactions were further investigated by analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial wash. It was demonstrated that pre-exposure to DE, as compared to filtered air, enhances the O 3 -induced airway inflammation, in terms of an increase in neutrophil and macrophage numbers in BW and higher EPX expression in BAL. In conclusion, this thesis has aspired to expand the knowledge of O 3 -induced inflammatory pathways in humans, observing a divergence to the previously described DE initiated responses. Moreover, a potentially adverse airway inflammation augmentation has been revealed after exposure to a relevant ambient combination of these air pollutants. This provides a foundation towards an understanding of the cumulative airway effects when exposed to a combination of ambient air pollutants and may have implications regarding future regulations of exposure limits...|$|R
