5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Webber's third-place finish <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship. Alonso's victory <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> move up into second place, eleven points behind Webber. Hamilton's retirement meant that he slipped to third place, nine points behind Alonso.

50|$|Ethan Edwards' Skrull {{physiology}} <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> shapeshift into {{virtually any}} form that he chooses. He also has superhuman strength, healing powers, energy projection, flight {{and the ability}} to see every frequency in the light spectrum, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> see Sue Storm when she's invisible. He's also invulnerable, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> withstand physical injuries. However, when battling the Thing, he was knocked unconscious.|$|R
5|$|Granderson was {{recruited}} {{by a number}} of college baseball programs, and he chose the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in part because they <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play basketball in addition to baseball. However, Granderson quit basketball two weeks into his freshman year in order to concentrate on baseball.|$|E
5|$|In the group's early career, Townshend favoured Rickenbacker guitars as they <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fret rhythm guitar chords {{easily and}} move the neck back and {{forwards}} to create vibrato. From 1968 to 1973, he favoured a Gibson SG Special live, and later used customised Les Pauls in different tunings.|$|E
5|$|Since Betances' exile {{depended}} on who was governing Puerto Rico at the time, {{a change in}} government <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to Mayagüez in 1862. However, a few years later, (1868) Luperón and Betances would both end up exiled in Saint Thomas.|$|E
5000|$|Erik now has turbo boots which <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> jump {{much higher}} than before and can smash certain {{overhead}} walls with his turbo jump. The helmet also <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> swim.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{get some}} first-team {{experience}} {{before heading to}} the United States for a scholarship, Lewis Hawke was released <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sign on amateur terms at Annan Athletic.|$|R
5000|$|Membrain - Member of Gene Nation. Composed of mucous membrane, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> liquify {{himself and}} flow at will, mucous has psychic {{properties}} that <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> view distant places and stun his opponents.|$|R
5|$|Symbols {{of death}} {{appeared}} in his other work from this period. Soon after his stroke, the Russian royal family purchased {{a number of his}} earlier works, and the proceeds <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> travel to Teplitz—in today's Czech Republic—to recover.|$|E
5|$|Zappa {{joined his}} first band at Mission Bay High School in San Diego as the drummer. About {{the same time}} his parents bought a phonograph, which <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> develop his {{interest}} in music, and to begin building his record collection.|$|E
5|$|After Alois's {{sudden death}} on 3 January 1903, Hitler's {{performance}} at school deteriorated {{and his mother}} <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved. In 1905, after passing {{a repeat of the}} final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.|$|E
50|$|While {{conceding that}} Marinol can be {{effective}} for treatment of hypertension and would <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have an acceptable quality of life, Kubby said.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Drew {{has limited}} powers of telepathy, which <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sense emotions, read minds (only surface thoughts), and telekinesis, which <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly, {{generate}} force fields, and lift heavy objects through force of mind alone.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries made {{it much more difficult}} to run, cycling has <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape. As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E
5|$|Bagramyan's {{experience}} in military planning as a {{chief of staff}} <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> distinguish himself as a capable commander {{in the early stages}} of the Soviet counter-offensives against Nazi Germany. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commander of the 1st Baltic Front. As commander of the Baltic Front, he participated in the offensives which pushed German forces out of the Baltic republics.|$|E
50|$|Red Nine has no superpowers but wears {{a costume}} that <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly {{and gives him}} superhuman strength. The costume also <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{generate}} a force field that protects him from harm, and shoot energy bolts.|$|R
5000|$|The Nth {{metal in}} Hawkman's wings, belt, harness, and boots is {{controlled}} mentally and <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> defy gravity. His wings <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> control flight, though {{they can be}} [...] "flapped" [...] through use of shoulder motions.|$|R
50|$|Rossano schemes <b>to</b> have Batterson <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go to New York, {{supposedly}} to {{have his}} manager appraise Batterson's sister Brigit's singing voice but in reality <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do a performance. After realizing he's been tricked, the sergeant sets out to make Rossano's military life considerably more difficult.|$|R
5|$|Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Empress Aelia Verina, who was the wife of Emperor Leo I (457–474).

5|$|Bradbury {{was called}} up for service in World War II in early 1941, {{although}} the Navy <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay at Stanford {{until the end}} of the academic year. He was then sent to the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, to work on external ballistics. Already working at Dahlgren were Loeb and Commander Deak Parsons.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{earnings}} from his offices {{had made him}} a wealthy man, even {{by the standards of}} his patrons. This wealth <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, from the Earl of Morton, which brought him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his spacecraft the Pax Romana, Marcus' advanced suit of alien armor <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly, grants <b>him</b> superhuman strength and speed, and <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> generate an energy blade, similar to a lightsaber, and an energy shield.|$|R
5000|$|... : Silver armor on Zero's {{chest and}} {{shoulders}} which functions as solar panels, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{put out of}} exhaustion {{for a longer period}} in combat.

50|$|Pulisic is {{a modern-day}} number 10. His low {{center of gravity}} <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dribble at high speeds. Recently, he has played more of a winger role for Dortmund. His adept weak foot skills <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play {{on either side of}} the field.|$|R
5|$|By 1 March, the {{withdrawal}} was complete. His forces were mostly intact, but the fighting had been fierce: his Shield and Sword counter-attacks alone had cost him some 10,000–12,000 men. These counter-attacks usually failed to recover ground, {{but they kept}} the Red Army off-balance and won Model time to pull his units back. They also <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> say to Hitler that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Les Chants Magnétiques was {{released}} on 20 May 1981, Oxygène and Équinoxe had achieved global sales of about 6million units. In its first two months the new album sold a reported 200,000units in France alone. The album uses sounds from the Fairlight CMI, a new instrument of which Jarre was an early pioneer. Its digital technology <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> continue his earlier sonic experimentation in new ways.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Frank Medina, USAAF, was an {{air crew}} member on a B-24 that was shot down over Italy. He was the only crewmember to evade capture. Medina {{explained}} that his ability to speak Spanish had <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> communicate with friendly Italians who helped him avoid capture for eight months behind enemy lines.|$|E
5000|$|Grey: Grey's passive {{abilities}} <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> walk farther in one turn {{than most}} other characters, and his spear <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> strike two enemies at the same time. Grey is flippant and prone to speaking before he thinks, often leading to bickering with Adara.|$|R

For example, the character Fuuma's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fake a special move; J. Max's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> catch, hold onto, and throw back projectiles; and Kim Dragon's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> perform counters while blocking.|$|R
