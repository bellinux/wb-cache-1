5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people.</b> Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people.</b> By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo Bay {{massacre}} or Elliston massacre {{refers to}} a fatal clash between settlers and Aboriginal Australians in late May 1849 on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay near Elliston, South Australia {{which led to the}} deaths of a number of <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people,</b> and forms part of the Australian frontier wars. The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three white settlers by <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people,</b> and the killing of one Aboriginal person and the death by poisoning of five others by white settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts of the killing of up to 260 <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.|$|E

Endorsing postsecondary education for <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>peoples</b> advocates an invigorating, fortifying future for <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>peoples,</b> their families, and their communities. Additionally, the postsecondary educational achievements of <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>peoples</b> support the health and sustainability of the Canadian nation; spearheaded by Western Canada’s current economic prosperity, human resources supplied by <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>peoples</b> have become increasingly important.

5|$|In March 1839, white {{settlers}} arrived from Adelaide, {{the capital of}} the colony of South Australia, to establish Port Lincoln on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula. There were significant clashes between settlers and <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> in the years that followed, as settlers spread out to establish pastoral runs around the township. In 1842, soldiers were sent to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to help protect the settlers, but the remoteness from Adelaide, and the vaguely defined powers and limited policing resources of the Government Resident, the local representative of the colonial government, meant that there were serious limitations on the rule of law in the region. This was especially true with respect to <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people,</b> who were supposed to be treated as British subjects {{in the same way as}} the settlers. In common with other areas of South Australia, and Australia as a whole, settlers on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes resulted in violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man, the only such sentence in South Australia's pioneer history. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared covert war between settlers and <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1849, {{stores were}} taken from a hut on Thomas Cooper Horn's station and a hutkeeper and {{shepherd}} were threatened by <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people,</b> who left with the goods they had taken. The station owner {{and some of his}} station hands pursued the group, and when they caught up with the fleeing party of <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> shots were fired and spears thrown. The Aboriginal group split in two, and Horn and his men followed one party to the Waterloo Bay cliffs, which the group tried to climb down in order to make their escape. Horn and his men opened fire, and two <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> were killed and one was fatally wounded, with several more being captured. The Government Resident and the police inspector from Port Lincoln both wrote detailed accounts of the incident, neither of which mentioned a large number of casualties. One specified that only two <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>people</b> were killed. In September, a group of Aboriginal men were transported to Adelaide for trial. Two were convicted of the murder of Beevor, and were transported back to the Elliston district where they were hanged outside his hut. Three were charged with the murder of Easton, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. A number of others were charged over the confrontation at the hut on Horn's station. Shortly after this, two more Aboriginal men were arrested in Port Lincoln by the police and charged with the murder of Hamp. Found guilty and sentenced to death, they were later released when doubts were raised about the testimony of Aboriginal witnesses located by the police. In February 1852 another Aboriginal male was arrested as an accomplice in Hamp's murder, but after being transported to Adelaide, he too was released due to lack of evidence. He tried to walk home to his country, and was murdered by four Aboriginal men for trespassing.|$|E
