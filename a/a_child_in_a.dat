5|$|Elaine's role is {{significantly}} reduced for the sequel , though {{the majority of}} the story is conveyed by Guybrush to Elaine {{in the form of a}} flashback. Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor's mansion on Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a map that belonged to Elaine's grandfather, which leads to fabled treasure Big Whoop. After discovering Guybrush's intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him. Guybrush eventually becomes trapped at the site of Big Whoop, with Elaine arriving to rescue him. Guybrush falls into a chasm, where he is confronted by LeChuck, recently resurrected as a zombie.

25|$|Under Kaine, {{participation}} in Virginia {{in early childhood}} education increased by 40.2% due to the Kaine's expansion of the Virginia Preschool Initiative, which makes pre-kindergarten more accessible to four-year-olds from households close to the poverty line.

It is still likely however that following the more recent case of R v Stone & Dobinson, a conviction for manslaughter or murder would arise, where the neglect or lack of care by a parent is either intentional, or grossly negligent.|$|E

25|$|Venus {{revels in}} having the girl under her power, and turns Psyche {{over to her}} two handmaids, Worry and Sadness, to be whipped and tortured. Venus tears her clothes and bashes her head into the ground, and mocks her for conceiving <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sham marriage. The goddess then throws before her a great mass of mixed wheat, barley, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils, and beans, {{demanding}} that she sort them into separate heaps by dawn. But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task. Venus is furious when she returns drunk from the feast, and only tosses Psyche a crust of bread. At {{this point in the}} story, it is revealed that Cupid is also in the house of Venus, languishing from his injury.|$|E
25|$|Coppola's {{next project}} was Jack, which was {{released}} on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so {{at the age of}} ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, Jack also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film Big, in which Tom Hanks also played <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for Jack, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.|$|E

500|$|Streep {{is the one}} who {{suggested}} the editorial meeting scene, which does not advance the plot but shows Miranda at work without Andrea present. It was also her idea that Miranda not wear makeup in the scene where she opens up to Andrea and worries about the effect on her daughters of her divorce becoming public knowledge. Blunt, for her part, contributed the line where she tells Andy [...] "I'm hearing this", while opening and closing her hand, [...] "and I want to hear this" [...] keeping it closed. In 2015 she told Howard Stern that she had overheard a mother saying that to <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supermarket during production.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Wilco albums, Sky Blue Sky {{features more}} songwriting collaboration between Tweedy {{and the other}} members of the band. As a result, a variety of lyrical themes appear on Sky Blue Sky (Tweedy was the only designer of the songs on A Ghost Is Born, using Pro Tools, before presenting them to the band). The title track references the worries Tweedy had as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small town while [...] "On and On and On" [...] is an ode to Tweedy's father's experience after the death of Tweedy's mother. Not every song on the album is as serious—"Hate It Here" [...] somewhat humorously describes a man who tries to fill his free time with chores after breaking up with his lover.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} {{with the}} characters' reaction to Lori opting for an abortion. Halden criticized the character's opposing {{views on the}} matter, and stated that their reasonings were invalid. Halden wrote. [...] "I'm not even sure {{it would be possible}} for her to abort the pregnancy at this point, but the show's working on the assumption that having <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world where death literally lurks around every corner is an unequivocal good. The only person who’s been anti-pregnancy is Lori, and the show hasn't managed to cast her in a very good light, so it’s not like her arguments hold much water—which is also ridiculous, because ultimately, her opinion {{is the only one that}} matters." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and stated that Rick's arguments against Lori's attempts were obsolete.|$|E
500|$|In his {{discussion}} of the film's relation to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved [...] "examination of the process of human interaction and interpersonal communication" [...] and [...] "immediately establishes [...] self-referential stance" [...] that invites the spectator [...] "to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth". For him, Alvy [...] "is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning -- or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' -- and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure." [...] Marcus Geduld cites the flashback to Alvy as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> therapist's office with his mother) as an example of basic problems (poverty, discordant parents) being masked by a supposed existential crisis.|$|E
500|$|John Howard becomes {{leader of}} the Opposition, {{presenting}} a new threat to Keating. [...] Howard describes his intense desire for power and his thirst for revenge against the petty humiliations put on him as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> menacing minor-key march ("Power"). [...] However, in the media he presents himself as [...] "a normal bloke and nothing more" [...] ("The Mateship"). [...] Through various costume changes, he attempts to cast himself as a sports fan, {{a friend of the}} Australian soldier and a farmer, though the song implies that these are only costumes. [...] The song also refers to the [...] "children overboard" [...] affair, his criticism of political correctness, and his use of immigration as a political issue, some of which occurred after the actual Howard's subsequent election to Prime Minister. [...] In a slow rock duet, Keating and Howard both beseech voters to [...] "Choose Me". [...] However, as the 1996 electoral polls close, Keating concludes that he is doomed electorally. [...] He sings of his unachieved dreams and with some bitterness at what he sees as the backward-looking message of his opponent in a country-influenced ballad referring to former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley's description of Labor's overarching goals ("The Light On The Hill").|$|E
