40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology to jointly minimise the operating cost, the carbon footprint and the delivery {{time in the}} design of multi-modal fresh food distribution networks. A tri-objective linear programming model optimises such criteria overcoming the widely adopted methodologies focused on the network cost minimisation, only. A practical selection rule supports the final network structure definition, leading to an effective trade-off among the three objective functions. The market demand supply, the producer capacity limits and the food quality decrease during shipment, i. e., perishability, limit the feasibility region. The paper applies the proposed model to an industrial case study dealing with the distribution of fruits and vegetables from a set of Italian producers to multiple European retailers through a multi-modal (truck, train and <b>air)</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>network.</b> The case study key results suggest the possibility to reduce the CO 2 emissions without relevant cost increase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn large {{commercial}} buildings facing high cooling loads, conventional heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are typically {{based on the}} use of one, or few, large-capacity air handling units (AHUs) to supply conditioned air throughout a centrally-managed <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>network.</b> The alternative concept of ‘decentralized’ HVAC typically entails the deployment of multiple, small capacity fan coil units (FCUs) operating as dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) and located closest to the individual thermal zones they must condition. For this study, the authors commissioned the development of a small capacity, packaged cooling coil with built-in enthalpy recovery devices. This customised unit, intended for use in a cooling-only, decentralized DOAS configuration, includes: two rotary wheels for sensible and latent energy recovery, a single cooling coil, and both supply and exhaust fans. The unit has been intended for building air conditioning use in the Singaporean climate. This paper provides energy performance data based on laboratory testing of the unit with independent control of the following variables: outdoor air conditions, return air conditions, and chilled water flow rate. It is intended that empirical data offered by this study can be adapted for use in future building energy models of decentralized HVAC systems...|$|E
40|$|Mining {{progress}} in underground mines cause the ongoing movement of working areas. Consequently, it becomes neces-sary {{to adapt the}} ventilation network of a mine to direct airflow into newly-opened districts. For economic reasons, opening new fields is often achieved via underground workings. Length of primary intake and return routes increases and also increases the total resistance of a complex ventilation network. The development of a subsurface structure can make it necessary to change the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> in a ventilation network. Increasing airflow into newly-opened districts is necessary. In mines where extraction does not entail gas-related hazards, there is possibility of implementing a push-pull ventilation system in order to supplement airflows to newly developed mining fields. This is achieved by installing sub-surface fan stations with forcing fans {{at the bottom of}} downcast shaft. In push-pull systems with multiple main fans, it is vital to select forcing fans with characteristic curves matching those of the existing exhaust fans to prevent undesirable mutual interaction. In complex ventilation networks it is necessary to calculate distribution of airflow (especially in net-works with a large number of installed fans). In the article the influence of applying additional forcing fans for the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> in ventilation <b>network</b> for underground mine were considered. There are also analysed the extent of over-pressure caused by the additional forcing fan in branches of the ventilation network (the operating range of additional forcing fan). Possibilities of increasing airflow rate in working areas were conducted...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the chilled beam system is its lower operating cost. For example, because the temperature of cooled water {{is higher than the}} temperature of cooled air, but it delivers the same cooling ability, the costs of the cooled water system are lower. Because cooling and heating of air are no longer linked to the delivery of air, buildings also save money by being able to run fewer air circulation fans and at lower speeds. One estimate places the amount of air handled at 25 to 50 percent less using chilled beam systems. By being able to target the delivery of clean outdoor air where it is needed (rather than injecting it into the entire system and heating or cooling it), there is a reduced need to treat large amounts of outdoor air (also saving money). In one case, the Genomic Science Building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lowered its HVAC costs by 20 percent with an active chilled beam system. This is a typical energy cost savings. Chilled beam systems also have some advantages in that they are almost noiseless, require little maintenance, and are highly efficient. Traditional fan-driven HVAC systems create somewhat higher air velocities, which some people find uncomfortable. Chilled beam HVAC systems also require less ceiling space than forced-air HVAC systems, which can lead to lower building heights and higher ceilings. Since they do not require high forced air flows, chilled beam systems also require reduced <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> duct <b>networks</b> (which also helps to lower cost).|$|R

The main objective of the proposed work is to allocate losses of the unbalanced <b>distribution</b> <b>network</b> by the firefly algorithm in regulated and deregulated environments before and after loss minimization. Reconfiguration is one of the methods for loss reduction of unbalanced <b>distribution</b> <b>network.</b> Further, optimal placement of distributed generation and capacitor in the reconfigured unbalanced <b>distribution</b> <b>network</b> can further reduce the loss. The results of reconfigured unbalanced <b>distribution</b> <b>network</b> in regulated environment have already been reported.
