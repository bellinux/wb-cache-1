5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was Paramount's fourth highest-grossing film of 2013, {{following}} new graphic {{novel and}} franchise entries: World War Z, Star Trek Into Darkness, and , respectively. It is estimated that, following published production costs, marketing and advertising fees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of overseas revenue that was lost by the domestic studio, similar fantasy reboots such as Snow White and the Huntsman, Mirror, Mirror, Jack the Giant Slayer, , and I, Frankenstein fail {{to match the}} total studio winnings for Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which makes {{it one of the}} most financially successful films of the fantasy-reboot genre, despite having the smallest estimated budget and lowest Metascore of the recent entries.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Sélestat is relatively young, 39.7% {{of the population}} were under 30 in 2009 (France: 37.2%) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of people over 60 years old (19%) was lower than the national (21.8%) figure. Sélestat has {{a significant proportion of}} people between 15 and 44 (42.7%, compared to 38.9% for all of France) because it attracts a large number of young actives and couples starting a family. As other towns in the region, such as Saverne, Haguenau and Molsheim, it welcomes young adults and encourages them to settle in the surrounding villages.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E

However the identity of the dominant species differs between sites.

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E

5|$|The Turks {{began to}} apply {{restrictions}} on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, {{in response to}} the start of the First Aliyah earlier that year.

At the same time, with growing distrust of the Young Turks – Turkish nationalists who had taken control of the Empire in 1908 – and the Second Aliyah, Arab nationalism was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic.
