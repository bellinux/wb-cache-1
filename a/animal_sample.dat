25|$|One of the {{frequent}} {{uses of the}} technique is to date organic remains from archaeological sites. Plants fix atmospheric carbon during photosynthesis, so the level of 14C in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of 14C in the atmosphere at that time. However, it decreases thereafter from radioactive decay, allowing the date of death or fixation to be estimated. The initial 14C level for the calculation can either be estimated, or else directly compared with known year-by-year data from tree-ring data (dendrochronology) up to 10,000 years ago (using overlapping data from live and dead trees in a given area), or else from cave deposits (speleothems), back to about 45,000 years before the present. A calculation or (more accurately) a direct comparison of carbon-14 levels in a sample, with tree ring or cave-deposit carbon-14 levels of a known age, then gives the wood or <b>animal</b> <b>sample</b> age-since-formation.|$|E

A theory has circulated that blood doping {{could account for the}} minute traces if the clenbuterol was introduced through a transfusion, re-introducing contaminated blood that had been extracted {{at a time when he}} had been taking Clenbuterol. It was supposed that this caused the presence of it in his system and the subsequent failed test, rather than the direct ingestion or injection of the drug at the time. This theory also recognises that Clenbuterol is not very effective at all as a performance enhancing drug, but it is effective if used to strip fat and hence reduce a rider's weight pre-season, and it is theorized that this is when the blood was taken which was later re-introduced by transfusion.|$|E

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) of {{ventricular}} myocytes (VMs) is {{an emerging}} technology in adult cardiac research that is {{challenged by the}} wide variety of VM shapes and sizes. Cellular variability and cytometer flow cell size can affect cytometer performance. These two factors of variance limit assay validity and reproducibility across laboratories. Washing and filtering of ventricular cells in suspension are routinely done to prevent cell clumping and minimize data variability without the appropriate standardization. We hypothesize that washing and filtering arbitrarily biases towards sampling smaller VMs than what actually exist in the adult heart. To determine the impact of washing and filtering on adult ventricular cells for cell sizing and FCM. Left ventricular cardiac cells in single-cell suspension were harvested from New Zealand White rabbits and fixed prior to analysis. Each ventricular sample was aliquoted before washing or filtering through a 40, 70, 100 or 200 μm mesh. The outcomes of the study are VM volume by Coulter Multisizer and light-scatter signatures by FCM. Data are presented as mean±SD. Myocyte volumes without washing or filtering (NF) served as the "gold standard" within the sample and ranged from 11, 017 to 46, 926 μm 3. Filtering each <b>animal</b> <b>sample</b> through a 200 μm mesh caused no variation in the post-filtration volume (1. 01 + 0. 01 fold vs. NF, n = 4 rabbits, p = 0. 999) with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (%CV) of < 5 % for all 4 samples. Filtering each sample through a 40, 70 or 100 μm mesh invariably reduced the post-filtration volume by 41 ± 10 %, 9. 0 ± 0. 8 % and 8. 8 ± 0. 8 % respectively (n = 4 rabbits, p< 0. 0001), and increased the %CV (18 % to 1. 3 %). The high light-scatter signature by FCM, a simple parameter for the identification of ventricular myocytes, was measured after washing and filtering. Washing discarded VMs and filtering cells through a 40 or 100 μm mesh reduced larger VM by 46 % or 11 % respectively (n = 6 from 2 rabbits, p< 0. 001). Washing and filtering VM suspensions through meshes 100 μm or less biases myocyte volumes to smaller sizes, excludes larger cells, and increases VM variability. These findings indicate that validity and reproducibility across laboratories can be compromised unless cell preparation is standardized. We propose no wash prior to fixation and a 200 μm mesh for filtrations to provide a reproducible standard for VM studies using FCM...|$|E
40|$|This work {{represents}} {{the most recent}} development of Zn isotopic measurements, and the first identification of Zn isotopic fractionation in natural materials using Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (TIMS). The procedures developed in this research systematically evaluates and solves several critical analytical issues involved in TIMS Zn isotopic measurements such as, reducing the size of sample needed to perform an accurate and precise measurement, minimizing the effect of interferences on the Zn fractionation, reducing the blank associated with the analyses, dissolution and purification of different natural samples, and the generally ignored issue {{of the effect of}} the ion exchange chemistry (Zn separation) to the fractionation of Zn. These procedures have allowed sub-permil fractionations in the isotopic composition of Zn to be revealed in small Zn sample (1 µg), and the determination of low level (ng) elemental abundance of Zn in samples to be measured accurately by the means of isotope dilution mass spectrometry IDMS. This thesis uses the rigorous double spike technique to measure fractionation, relative to the internationally proposed absolute Zn isotopic reference material (δ zero), based on a high purity Alfa Aesar 10759, now available to the international isotope community. All the isotopic measurements in natural materials were performed on bulk samples purified by ion exchange chemistry. The isotopic composition of the Zn minerals and igneous rocks agreed with that of the absolute reference material, which makes it possible to consider this reference material as being representative of “bulk Earth” Zn. Significant and consistent fractionation of ~+ 0. 3 ‰ per amu were found in 5 sediments from a range of localities. The consistency of this is attributed to conveyor type oceanic circulations effects. The results from the two metamorphic samples indicate that the fractionation of Zn in these rocks is the same as found in igneous rocks but are different from the Zn found in sedimentary rocks. This supports the widely held assumption that high temperature and pressure processes do not fractionate the isotopic composition of chalcophile elements, such as has been found for Cd. Clay sample TILL- 3 appears to exhibit a consistently slightly positive Zn fractionation of + 0. 12 ± 0. 10 ‰ amu- 1, although inside the uncertainties of both igneous and sedimentary rocks, which is not surprising since Till is thought to be a formed from a range of mixed glacial sediments The isotopic composition of Zn was measured in two plants and one <b>animal</b> <b>sample.</b> The fractionation of (- 0. 088 ± 0. 070 ‰ amu- 1) of Zn in the Rice (a C 3 type plant material) sample suggested that Zn may be used to study Zn systematics in plants. The result obtained for MURST-Iss-A 2 (Antarctic Krill) was + 0. 21 ± 0. 11 ‰ amu- 1 relative to the laboratory standard which is similar to the average Zn fractionation results of + 0. 281 ± 0. 083 ‰ amu- 1 obtained for marine sediments. In this work, the isotopic composition of Zn was measured in five stone and two iron meteorites. The range of Zn fractionation in stone meteorites was between - 0. 287 ± 0. 098 and + 0. 38 ± 0. 16 ‰ amu- 1, and was consistent with previous work, although more measurements would be needed to generalize this to all stone meteorites. In iron meteorites; Canyon Diablo was found to have the greatest fractionation of + 1. 11 ± 0. 11 ‰ amu- 1 relative to the laboratory standard. Of all the meteorites studied, Redfields clearly showed an anomalous isotopic composition indicating that this meteorite possesses a significantly different Zn isotopic composition compared to all of the other natural materials measured. Using 64 Zn as a reference isotope, significant differences relative to the laboratory standard were found of + 5. 6 ± 0. 4 ‰, + 4. 4 ± 3. 6 ‰, and + 21. 0 ± 0. 9 ‰ and + 27. 4 ± 18. 8 ‰ on 66 Zn and 67 Zn, 68 Zn and 70 Zn respectively. These significant “Redfields anomalies” can be interpreted {{in a number of ways}} in relation to their nucleosynthetic production. Whether Redfields is a primitive type of iron meteorite or not, the Redfields anomaly strongly suggests wide spread isotopic heterogeneity of at least one part of the Solar System and does not support the suggestion that “Zn was derived from an initially single homogeneous reservoir in the early Solar System”. A pilot study to determine the concentration and the isotopic composition of Zn in River and tap water was performed. The concentration of Zn in River water averaged 6. 9 ± 0. 8 ngg- 1, while for tap water it ranged from 13. 1 ngg- 1 to 5. 2 μgg- 1. River water was fractionated by - 1. 09 ± 0. 70 ‰ amu- 1, while restrained tap water yielded the maximum fractionation of - 6. 39 ± 0. 62 ‰ amu- 1 relative to the laboratory standard. The Zn fractionation of tap water is much larger than all other natural samples, although the uncertainty is also significantly greater due to the use of the less precise Daly detector used for these preliminary experimental measurements. The fractionation of Zn in seven ultra pure Zn standard materials was measured relative to the laboratory standard and found to range from - 5. 11 ± 0. 36 ‰ amu- 1 for AE 10760 to + 0. 12 ± 0. 16 ‰ amu- 1 for Zn IRMM 10440. There appears to be some evidence for a relationship between Zn fractionation and its purity. As well as natural materials, the fractionation of Zn was measured in a number of processed materials. None of these results or those obtained for natural materials impact on the currently IUPAC accepted value for the atomic weight of Zn. Along with fractionation determinations, the concentration of Zn was also measured by Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry in all of the samples. The concentration of Zn in five stony meteorites ranged from 26 ± 13 to 302 ± 14 μgg- 1 for Plainview and Orgueil respectively. For ordinary Chondrites, the concentration of Zn in the three samples analysed ranged from 26 ± 13 to 64 ± 34 μgg- 1 for Plainview and Brownfield 1937 respectively. The concentration of Zn was measured in two metamorphic rocks standard materials; the maximum concentration was 101. 5 ± 1. 7 µgg- 1 in SDC- 1. The concentration of Zn present in plant samples studied in this research was 22. 15 ± 0. 42, 14. 62 ± 0. 27 µgg- 1 for Rice IMEP- 19 and Sargasso NIES-Number 9 respectively which is within the normal range of Zn concentrations. Except for meteorites, the final uncertainties consistently cover the ranges of individual concentration measurements and indicate the homogeneity of the samples, including samples from different bottles where available. The final fractional uncertainties obtained for SRMs were all less than 2. 8 %, demonstrating the high level of precision possible using IDMS...|$|E
40|$|Because {{antimicrobial}} resistance in food-producing animals {{is a major}} public health concern, many countries have implemented antimicrobial monitoring systems at a national level. When designing a sampling scheme for {{antimicrobial resistance}} monitoring, {{it is necessary to}} consider both cost effectiveness and statistical plausibility. In this study, we examined how sampling scheme precision and sensitivity can vary with the number of <b>animals</b> <b>sampled</b> from each farm, while keeping the overall sample size constant to avoid additional sampling costs. Five sampling strategies were investigated. These employed 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 <b>animal</b> <b>samples</b> per farm, with a total of 12 <b>animals</b> <b>sampled</b> in each strategy. A total of 1, 500 Escherichia coli isolates from 300 fattening pigs on 30 farms were tested for resistance against 12 antimicrobials. The performance of each sampling strategy was evaluated by bootstrap resampling from the observational data. In the bootstrapping procedure, farms, animals, and isolates were selected randomly with replacement, and a total of 10, 000 replications were conducted. For each antimicrobial, we observed that the standard deviation and 2. 5 – 97. 5 percentile interval of resistance prevalence were smallest in the sampling strategy that employed 1 animal per farm. The proportion of bootstrap samples that included at least 1 isolate with resistance was also evaluated as an indicator of the sensitivity of the sampling strategy to previously unidentified antimicrobial resistance. The proportion was greatest with 1 sample per farm and decreased with larger samples per farm. We concluded that when the total number of samples is pre...|$|R
40|$|Giardia duodenalis (syn. Giardia lamblia, Giardia intestinalis) is a {{protozoan}} organism {{that can}} infect the intestinal tract of many animal species including mammals. Genetic heterogeneity of G. duodenalis is well described but the zoonotic potential {{is still not}} clear. In this study, we analysed 100 Giardia DNA samples directly isolated from human stool specimens, to get more insight in the different G. duodenalis assemblages present in the Dutch human population. Results showed that these human isolates could {{be divided into two}} main Assemblages A and B within the G. duodenalis group on the basis of PCR assays specific for the Assemblages A and B and the DNA sequences of 18 S ribosomal RNA and the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes. Genotyping results showed that G. duodenalis isolates originating from Dutch human patients belonged in 35 % of the cases to Assemblage A (34 / 98) and in 65 % of the cases to Assemblage B (64 / 98) whereas two human cases remained negative in all assays tested. In addition, we compared these human <b>samples</b> with <b>animal</b> <b>samples</b> from the Netherlands and human and <b>animal</b> <b>samples</b> from other countries. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the DNA sequences obtained from these Giardia and those available in GenBank. Using gdh DNA sequence analysis, human and animal Assemblage A and B Giardia isolates could be identified. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed different sub-clustering for human and animal isolates where host-species-specific assemblages (C, D, E, F and G) could be identified. The geographic origin of the human and <b>animal</b> <b>samples</b> was not a discriminating factor...|$|R
