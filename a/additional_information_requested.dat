40|$|BACKGROUND: Verification of {{surgical}} staging has received little attention in clinical oncology trials. Central surgical review was undertaken during {{a study of}} malignant pediatric germ cell tumors. METHODS: Children's Oncology Group study AGCT 0132 included central surgical review during the study. Completeness of submitted data and confirmation of assigned stage were assessed. Review responses were: assigned status confirmed, assignment withheld pending review of <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> <b>requested,</b> or institutional assignment of stage disputed with explanation given. Changes in stage assignment were {{at the discretion of}} the enrolling institution. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients underwent central review. Failure to submit required data elements or need for clarification was noted in 40 %. Disagreement with stage assignment occurred in 10 % with 17 / 21 discordant patients reassigned to stage recommended by central review. Four ovarian tumor patients not meeting review criteria for Stage I remained in that stratum by institutional decision. Two-year event free survival in Stage I ovarian patients was 25 % for discordant patients compared to 57 % for those meeting Stage I criteria by central review. CONCLUSIONS: Central review of stage assignment improved complete data collection and assignment of correct tumor stage at study entry, and allowed for prompt initiation of chemotherapy in patients determined not to have Stage I disease...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Prior {{research}} has shown that Dutch general practitioners (GPs) do not always offer HIV testing and the number of undiagnosed HIV patients remains high. We aimed to further investigate the frequency and reasons for (not) testing for HIV and the contribution of GPs to the diagnosis of HIV infections in the Netherlands. Design: Observational study. Setting (1) : Dutch primary care network of 42 – 45 sentinel practices where report forms during sexually transmitted infection (STI) -related consultations were routinely collected, 2008 – 2013. (2) Dutch observational cohort with medical data of HIV-positive patients in HIV care, 2008 – 2013. Outcome measures: The proportion of STI-related consultations in patients from high-risk groups tested for HIV, with <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> from GPs on HIV testing preconsultation or postconsultation for whom HIV testing was indicated, but not performed. Next, information was collected on the profile of HIV-positive patients entering specialised HIV care following diagnosis by GPs. Results: Initially, an HIV test was reported (360 / 907) in 40 % of STI-related consultations in high-risk groups. Additionally, in 26 % of consultations an HIV test had been performed in previous or follow-up consultations or at different STI-care facilities. The main reasons for not testing were perceived insignificant risk; ‘too’ recent risk according to GPs or the reluctance of patients. The initiative of the patient was a strong determinant for HIV testing. GPs diagnosed about one third of all newly found cases of HIV. Compared with STI clinics, HIV-positive patients diagnosed in general practice {{were more likely to be}} older, female, heterosexual male or sub-Saharan African. Conclusions: In one-third of the STI-related consultations of persons from high-risk groups, no HIV test was performed in primary care, which is lower than previously reported. Risk-based testing has intrinsic limitations and implementation of new additional strategies in primary care is warranted. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
