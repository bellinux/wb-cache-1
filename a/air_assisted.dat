40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} laser {{machining}} of silicon wafer at various process parameters. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to investigate the effect of laser machining parameters on the cut surface quality and determine the feasible laser machining parameters that can machine silicon wafer. The thesis describes how machining parameters and <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> gas affects cut surface quality. The silicon wafer was machined by laser with and without <b>air</b> <b>assists.</b> Principally, two experimental sets with different cutting speed and laser power were designed in statistical software. The kerf widths and quality were observed under microscopes. The results then were analyzed using statistica software. The analysis indicated that cutting speed has significant effect to the kerf width and laser cutting with <b>air</b> <b>assists</b> produced wider kerf. Result obtained also showed that laser cutting without <b>air</b> <b>assists</b> produced better cut surface quality. The feasible machining parameter of silicon is estimated at 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 94 watt for laser power in laser cutting without <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> and 1. 0 - 4. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 90 watt for laser power in laser cutting with <b>air</b> <b>assist...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reduction of {{environmental}} contamination and improvement of biological efficacy {{are the two}} main targets in the optimization of orchard sprayers. There are {{a wide variety of}} <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> orchard sprayer designs and plant training systems that are currently in use around the world. Both the environmental and biological efficacy of any spray application process are the result of the complex interaction between these various spray flow patterns and tree architectures besides the environmental condition.

To this end, three different designs of <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> orchard sprayers are compared in this work for the apple classical training system using computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|AbstractAir curtain {{assisted}} range hoods {{are very}} customary in large industrial kitchens.

40|$|Apples at 24 ± 2 °C were heated in a {{pilot scale}} hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> (40 °C) {{continuous}} pentagonal microwave system, {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of this treatment on insect mortality (variety Mutsu) and fruit quality (variety Granny Smith). An average temperature of 53. 4 ± 1. 3 °C at core, bottom and flesh of the apple was recorded at the end of the treatment. One hundred percent mortality of the most tolerant stage of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni, Froggatt) and Jarvis's fruit fly (Bactrocera jarvisi, Tryon), were observed when the Mortality value (M 52, equivalent time of isothermal treatment at 52 °C) at the slowest heating point applicable for each experiment was ≥ 50 min and ≥ 37 min, respectively. Results showed that microwave heat treatment is effective for insect disinfestation without any adverse impact on total soluble solids, flesh or peel firmness of the treated apples. The treated apples recorded a significantly higher pH and lower ion leakage than the untreated apples after 3 or 4 weeks. Therefore, the microwave heat treatment has the potential to be developed as an alternative chemical free quarantine treatment against economically significant insect pests. Industrial relevance Hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> microwave heating of fruits and vegetables, is more cost effective compared to vapour heat treatment and ionising radiation for disinfestation of insects. Microwave treatment is environmentally friendly compared to fumigation and chemical treatments. Hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> microwave disinfestation can be performed at farms or centralised pack houses since the capital cost would be comparatively lower than vapour heat or ionising radiation treatments...|$|E
40|$|In pressure-swirl atomizer, a {{swirling}} motion is imparted to the fuel, leading {{it under the}} action of the centrifugal force to spread out {{in the form of a}} hollow cone as soon as it leaves the exit orifice. This kind of atomizer finds its use in gas turbines and liquid propellant rockets. The combustion usually starts at the periphery of spray and the flame front travels towards the center of the spray. The availability of air for combustion therefore decreases as the flame travels towards the center of the spray from pressure swirl atomizer. The newer approach is to develop {{a swirling}} air core in the center of the spray. This approach led to the development of <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> pressure swirl atomizer. This paper presents the experimental investigations of <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> pressure swirl atomizer for spray cone angle and penetration length at different injection pressure differential ranging from 3 bar to 18 bar in an increment of 3 bar.

40|$|The CAI/HCCI {{combustion}} {{was achieved}} through residual gas trapping using the negative valve overlap method {{in a direct}} injection single cylinder gasoline engine with optical access. Effects of injection timing and spark discharge on the engines performance and emission were investigated by means of simultaneous in-cylinder heat release analysis and the high-speed chemiluminescence imaging technique. The presence and magnitude of fuel reformation and heat release associated with the fuel injection into lean-burn residual gases were identified. Furthermore, the effect of quantity of directly injected air from an <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> injector into stoichiometric burned residual gas was studied. The in-cylinder heat release and imaging showed that spark discharge had much less effect on the heat release process in the lean-burn CAI operation than that in the stoichiometric operation because of the less ignitability of the leaner mixture. Direct injection into the hot residual gas was found to produce minor heat release and lead to chemiluminescence. This process resulted in higher charge temperature and earlier autoignition followed. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} small quantity of air injection included in the <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> injection process during the negative valve overlap period could be used to promote the fuel reforming and minor heat release reactions in order to control the main combustion phasing. ...|$|E

METHODS: Sixty ODE patients were recruited, and these patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group received artificial tear treatment, and the other group received a new eyelid warm moist air device combined with eyelid massage treatment. Subjects completed the ocular surface disease index(OSDI), which was followed by fluorescein tear breakup time(BUT), corneal fluorescein staining(CFS), Schirmer I test(SⅠt) and meibomian gland secretion function evaluation at baseline, and 2 and 4 wk after treatment. RESULTS: In these 60 patients, 48 patients(23 in artificial tear treated group and 25 in the new warm moist <b>air</b> device <b>assisted</b> with eyelid massage treated group) were positive for meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD). Compared to artificial tear treatment, the new warm moist <b>air</b> device <b>assisted</b> with eyelid massage treatment showed favorable therapeutic effect on OSDI(F Group = 41. 63, P F Group = 60. 47, P F Group = 12. 12, P F Group = 0. 17, P > 0. 05), CFS(F Group = 1. 79, P > 0. 05) and meibomian gland expressibility(F Group = 0. 68, P > 0. 05) between the two groups during 4 wk treatment.
