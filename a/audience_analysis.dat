50|$|The {{constitutive}} model of rhetoric {{dates back to}} the ancient Greek Sophists, with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge. Kenneth Burke contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.” Edwin Black's theory of the second persona also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and <b>audience</b> through textual <b>analysis.</b> <b>Audience</b> must adopt a particular ethos prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.|$|R
40|$|This paper focusses on stylistic {{analysis}} of one selected speech of Obafemi Awolowo; a Nigerian, lawyer, philosopher and statesman. Awolowo occupied a significant position in Nigeria politics. Rhetorical communication {{has a special}} relationship with leadership and society and Nigerian leaders have adopted the medium as an effective way of making {{direct contact with the}} people. Political speeches are made by leaders to persuade, inform, correct and manipulate the audience. The text for this study is drawn from a collection of Awolowo‟s speeches as contained in Voice of Courage 1981 a titled “It is not life that matters but the courage you bring into it”. The speech is purposively sampled to demonstrate Awolowo‟s language use as a weapon of influencing his <b>audience.</b> The <b>analysis</b> is done within the framework of Halliday‟s Systemic Functional Grammar and New Rhetoric Approaches which concentrate on the examination of language forms and evaluate the ideas put forward in speech. Findings from the study show that Awolowo employed the use of the English language as a strategy of persuasion to gain the support of his <b>audience.</b> The <b>analysis</b> reveals the effectiveness of Awolowo‟s language use...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} design for {{this paper is}} based on the critical need for greater emphasis by Australian arts organizations on relationship marketing as a means of achieving sustainability. Recent injections of government funds into the performing arts in Australia, to meet a "crisis" in financial viability and audience development, highlighted the dependence of arts organizations on government funds in building audiences. A hypothesis was developed through an analysis of the literature on relationship marketing, cultural economics and value measurement, and an analysis of the long-term outcomes of government strategies for the funding of arts marketing. The hypothesis is that while social intervention is acceptable (even desirable and necessary), and achieves the social goals of governments, market intervention reduces the benefits of relationship-building and the exchange of values between arts organizations and their <b>audiences.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of government documents and primary research in audience development proved the hypothesis. Empirical research resulted {{in the development of a}} theory and model that describe the limits of market intervention and in the development of a definition of values in the continuum of government activity from social to market intervention. The model could be useful for governments in developing arts policy with regard to audiencebuilding. It could also be useful in demonstrating to arts managers that sustainability results not from government funding but rather from relationship-marketing strategies. <br /...|$|R
