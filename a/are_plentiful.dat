5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources <b>are</b> <b>plentiful.</b> Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

Papulae <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud.

Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel <b>are</b> <b>plentiful.</b> Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits <b>are</b> <b>plentiful.</b> Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
5|$|Fish <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> in {{the waters}} {{surrounding}} the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E
5|$|Low-powered motorboats {{are allowed}} in the park; the {{majority}} of salt water areas are no-wake zones to protect manatees and other marine animals from harm. Jet skis, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing. Fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, but a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), alligators and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, and sharp dangerous coral <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> in salt water. Visibility is low in both kinds.|$|E

5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii {{produces}} a white spore print. Individual spores are ellipsoid {{with a small}} germ pore, smooth, thick-walled, and measure 13.4–24.8 by 9.6–16.0µm. They have a dextrinoid staining reaction (reddish-brown) with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, measuring 38.0–50 by 10.2–13.6µm. They are two-, three-, or four-spored, with sterigmata up to 8.0µm long. Collections with predominantly four-spored basidia will generally have smaller spores than those with two-spored basidia. Two-spored basidia produce spores with four nuclei. Cheilocystidia <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> {{on the edge of}} the gill. They have dimensions of 24.8–42.4 by 7.2–10.4µm, with a cylindrical to club shape. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Mammals <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> in the Hell Creek Formation. Groups {{represented}} include multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians. The multituberculates represented include Paracimexomys, the cimolomyids Paressonodon, Meniscoessus, Essonodon, Cimolomys, Cimolodon, and Cimexomys; and the neoplagiaulacids Mesodma, and Neoplagiaulax. The alphadontids Alphadon, Protalphodon, and Turgidodon, pediomyids Pediomys, Protolambda, and Leptalestes, the stagodontid Didelphodon, the deltatheridiid Nanocuris, the herpetotheriid Nortedelphys, and the glasbiid Glasbius all represent metatherians of the Hell Creek Formation. A few eutherians are known, being {{represented by}} Alostera, Protungulatum, the cimolestids Cimolestes and Batodon, the gypsonictopsid Gypsonictops, {{and the possible}} nyctitheriid Paranyctoides.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed.|$|E

5|$|The spores are ellipsoid, have {{a central}} germ pore, and measure 10–14 by 5.75–8μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{club-shaped}} and four-spored. The colorless pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) measure 70–140 by 20–45μm, and are roughly elliptical to flask-shaped, while the similarly shaped cheilocystidia (found on the gill edge) measure 50–95 by 15–25μm. Clamp connections {{are present in}} the hyphae of all tissues of P.auricoma. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of club-shaped, thin-walled cells measuring 25–40 by 10–30μm interspersed with long, dark, thick-walled setae. Yellowish-brown setae <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> on the cap surface, and consist of an elongated, hair-like segment up to 315μm long, attached to the surface by a bulbous base that is 3–9μm wide.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to elliptical, have {{a smooth}} surface, and dimensions of 8–11 to 3–4µm. There are both two- and four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), {{and they are}} club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 28–36 by 10–12µm. Cystidia <b>are</b> <b>plentiful,</b> and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly {{along the sides of}} the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48–60 by 7–9µm. The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages <b>are</b> <b>plentiful</b> in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E
