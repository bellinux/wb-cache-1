5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require {{wide receivers}} to wear jersey {{numbers in the}} 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their previous number, {{as long as it}} is not within the 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E

Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the dormitories.|$|E

She defended the port of Wilhelmshaven until the closing days of the war, when she was scuttled by her crew. The wreck was ultimately broken up for scrap in 19481950.|$|E

Even years later, they were often discriminated against in Romania under the communist government.|$|E
