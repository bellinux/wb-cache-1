For instance, each seat won in the 2011 parliamentary election brought a party 180,000kuna (euros).

5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E

5|$|The Curia of Other Municipalities {{consisted}} of 8764 electors from amongst small-scale rural landowners. There were {{two stages of}} voting for this curia.

These voters elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> equivalent to a rural district.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of {{constituencies}} (electoral divisions) in Singapore: Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). In SMCs candidates vie individually for parliamentary seats, whereas in GRCs the contest is between teams of candidates. Under the GRC scheme, which came into effect on 1 June 1988, the Government may, having regard to the number of voters in a particular constituency, advise the President to declare it to be a GRC and designate it as <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> in which {{at least one of the}} candidates is from the Malay community, or from the Indian or some other minority community in Singapore. Each team in a GRC may have between three and six candidates.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 general election, {{the party}} contested five constituencies, despite {{previously}} indicating it would vie for ten. These were the Lincolnshire seats of Boston and Skegness and Brigg and Goole alongside the West Midlands seats of Meriden and Solihull; additionally contested was Cheadle, <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> in Greater Manchester. Nattrass once again appeared on Daily Politics, interviewed by Jo Coburn on 1 April. No candidates were elected {{and the party}} accumulated a negligible vote share. Local elections {{in the same year}} saw the party unsuccessfully contest eight wards on East Lindsey District Council, with an additional candidate failing in his bid for election to Leicester City Council. The following year's local elections saw the party field a candidate for Exeter City Council, who was comfortably defeated. A day later, the party contested a local by-election for Croydon London Borough Council triggered by the resignation of Emily Benn; the party finished second last, above Winston McKenzie of the English Democrats. Independence from Europe failed to field any candidates in the 2017 local elections; incumbent Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver did not seek re-election and Chris Pain defected to the Lincolnshire Independents, leaving the party with no official political representation.|$|E
5|$|Born into an {{expatriate}} Ceylon Tamil {{family in}} Malaya, Chelvanayakam moved to Ceylon while still young.

As a young lawyer Chelvanayakam was not involved in politics but when the British established the Soulbury Commission to look into constitutional reform in Ceylon he and other Tamil people formed the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests. He was elected to Parliament in 1947 to represent Kankesanthurai, <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> he would represent until his death, except for a period between 1952 and 1956.

5|$|Mason faced {{difficulties}} in being {{elected to the}} ratifying convention from Fairfax County, since most freeholders there were Federalist, and he was at odds with many in Alexandria over local politics. The statute governing elections to the convention in Richmond allowed him to seek election elsewhere, and he campaigned for a seat from Stafford County, assuring electors {{that he did not}} seek disunion, but rather reform. He spoke against the unamended constitution in strong terms; George Nicholas, a Federalist friend of Mason, believed that Mason felt he could lead Virginia to gain concessions from the other states, and that he was embittered by the continuing attacks on him. On March 10, 1788, Mason finished first in the polls in Stafford County, winning one of its two seats; he apparently was the only person elected for <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> in which he did not live. Voter turnout was low, as many in remote areas without newspapers knew little about the constitution. The Federalists were believed to have a slight advantage in elected delegates; Mason thought that the convention would be unlikely to ratify the document without demanding amendments.|$|E
5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no need to live in <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> in order to vote there.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} to vote at a contested election in any constituency, a voter's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency. The name of the voter {{will be included in}} the register of electors for <b>a</b> <b>constituency</b> if on the cut-off date for the production of the register of electors the voter is a citizen of Singapore, at least 21 years old, and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency. For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors, information stated on a voter's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements, unless the facts are shown to be otherwise.|$|E
