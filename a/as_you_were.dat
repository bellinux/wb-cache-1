500|$|Obama was a {{participant}} in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's {{to such an extent that}} it was theorized that she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, [...] "the first lady is very popular". In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%. In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be [...] "hungry <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> back in 2008 and 2012". Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections. Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity. Obama raised her profile in October, touring three states in four days. Obama called the elections her husband's [...] "last campaign".|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{compared}} the song {{to the music}} of the band Blondie, and said: [...] "The rapid movement through the various sections, can't save the song from being fairly ordinary, but it passes quick enough. Bit like 24-hour flu, really." [...] Alex Henderson from Allmusic called the song [...] "an ultra-infectious gem that, unfortunately, isn't on any of the Material Girl's [...] CDs" [...] and felt that [...] "'Gambler' is one of those songs that should have been a major hit but wasn't, whereas 'Crazy for You' soared {{to the top of the}} pop charts." [...] > Overview |last=Henderson|first=Alex|date=September 8, 1985|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=March 5, 2010}} Alfred Soto of Stylus Magazine, described [...] "Gambler" [...] as a [...] "disco-punk, Flashdance edition" [...] and called it [...] "the most aggressive track of Madonna's career." [...] Soto added, [...] "'Gambler' is the only possible response to a slow dance in which you were left as unfulfilled <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> five minutes earlier. It deserves immortality beside 'Into the Groove' [...] The music is keyed to her vocals—insistent, strident, hip-thrusting; she slurs the line [...] "You're just jealous 'cuz you can't be me" [...] like it's a shot of Rumplemints; meanwhile Animotion synths blow up her skirt. Robert Christgau gave a mixed review of the song. R. Serge Denisoff and William D. Romanowski, authors of Risky business: rock in film, felt that the song seemed [...] "jammed into the movie with a plunger and little thought to appropriateness." [...] The Motion Picture Guide of 1986 included the song as one of the soundtrack's standouts.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the run of}} Carminetta, Delysia {{returned}} to revue in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Were,</b> by Herman Darewski and Arthur Wimperis, adapted from a French revue, Plus ça change. It opened in August 1918 at the London Pavilion, newly refurbished by Cochran ("transformed almost beyond recognition", according to The Observer). The show was structured around Delysia, giving her the chance to shine in a succession of roles including Ninon de l'Enclos, Helen of Troy, Elizabeth I, and Cleopatra. She also appeared as Lucifer, once again coming {{to the attention of}} the Lord Chamberlain for the skin-tight black costume in which she appeared. The Morning Post commented, [...] "Never can an actress have worn so negligible a dress".|$|E
2500|$|Within {{months of}} its debut, the record found a {{following}} among many of popular music's inner circle.

John Mayer later described the album in his Esquire magazine article: [...] "it {{may be one}} of the best albums to come around in the last five years...Music like this is jet fuel on the fire of a broken heart. Even if you think the flame has died, there's at least one lyric that'll hit that last hot spot, and then you'll find yourself as fucked <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the day you lied and said you never wanted to see her again.

2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? And how did you get over the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods...

2500|$|The {{group were}} {{supposed}} to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield {{the day after the}} departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: [...] "None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process." [...] Two tracks of the album were composed in that session: [...] "Love Thing" [...] and [...] "Say You'll Be There". In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, east London.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
