5000|$|<b>Acetamiprid</b> is {{classified}} as unlikely {{to be a human}} carcinogen. <b>Acetamiprid</b> has a low acute and chronic toxicity in mammals with no evidence of carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity or mutagenicity. It {{is classified}} as toxicity category rating II in acute oral studies with rats, toxicity category III in acute dermal and inhalation studies with rats, and toxicity category IV in primary eye and skin irritation studies with rabbits. It is mobile in soil, but degrades rapidly via aerobic soil metabolism, with studies showing its half life between <1 and 8.2 days. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not consider it to be environmentally persistent. The EPA considers it [...] "only moderately toxic" [...] to bees; however, some media sources and the recent documentary Vanishing of the Bees have blamed neonicotinoids like <b>acetamiprid</b> for colony collapse disorder.|$|E

40|$|<b>Acetamiprid</b> and {{thiamethoxam}} are insecticides introduced for pest control, {{but they}} can also affect non-target insects such as honeybees. In insects, these neonicotinoid insecticides are known to act on acetylcholine nicotinic receptors but the behavioral effects of low doses are not yet fully understood. The effects of <b>acetamiprid</b> and thiamethoxam were studied after acute sublethal treatment on the behavior of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) under controlled laboratory conditions.

Lead and cadmium treatments caused high percent mortalities 55. 6 % and 66. 7 % respectively, while <b>acetamiprid</b> at 67. 9 mg/kg/day caused 11. 1 % only. The mixtures of <b>acetamiprid</b> with lead and cadmium decreased the percent mortalities of lead and cadmium, {{this means that}} <b>acetamiprid</b> (cyanoimin group) had an antagonistic effect to heavy metals. Furthermore, we studied the effect of lead and cadmium treatments on activity of -ALAD, AChE and GST enzymes.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) from {{farms in}} the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, indicated resistance to <b>acetamiprid,</b> deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and esfenvalerate. At G 3, the field-derived population was divided into two subpopulations, one subpopuplation was selected (G 3 to Go 10) with <b>acetamiprid</b> (aceta-SEL), whereas the second subpopulation was left unselected (UNSEL). A significant reduction in the resistance ratio for each compound was observed in UNSEL at G, 1, indicating that the observed resistance to each insecticide was unstable. For aceta-SEL, bioassays at G,, found that selection with <b>acetamiprid</b> gave a resistance ratio of 409 compared with UNSEL. The LC 50 values for deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and esfenvalerate to aceta-SEL were similar at both G 11 and G 2. This suggests that <b>acetamiprid</b> selection maintained the otherwise unstable resistance to these compounds in the aceta-SEL population. Logit regression analysis of F 1 reciprocal crosses between aceta-SEL and the susceptible Lab-UK indicated that resistance to <b>acetamiprid</b> was inherited as an autosomal, incompletely recessive (DLC = 0. 26) trait.

40|$|The {{integrated}} control concept {{emphasizes the}} importance of both chemical and biological control for pest suppression in an agricultural system. A two-year field study was conducted to evaluate the selectivity of <b>acetamiprid</b> for controlling sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton compared with a proven selective regime based on insect growth regulators (IGRs) of pyriproxyfen and buprofezin. <b>Acetamiprid</b> was highly effective in controlling all stages of B. tabaci compared to our untreated control and generally produced lower pest densities than the IGR regime. However, six of 14 taxa of arthropod predator were significantly depressed with the use of <b>acetamiprid</b> compared to our untreated control, including common species such as Geocoris punctipes, Orius tristicolor, Chrysoperla carnea, Collops vittatus, Hippodamia convergens, and Drapetis nr. divergens. Compared to other independent and concurrent studies using mixtures of broad-spectrum insecticides at the same research site, <b>acetamiprid</b> depressed fewer populations of predator taxa in our study, but for those taxa affected, reductions from <b>acetamiprid</b> were larger in many cases. In contrast, only one species was significantly reduced in the IGR regime compared with the untreated control.

The interaction between EPS and organic pollutants is still little known. In the present study, the interaction of soluble/bound EPS with <b>acetamiprid,</b> a neonicotinoid insecticide, was investigated using the three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence spectra of EPS revealed that there were two classes of protein-like fluorophores in soluble/bound EPS and one class of fulvic acid-like fluorophore, in addition, in bound EPS. The quenching of protein-like fluorescence by <b>acetamiprid</b> indicated that static quenching (at peak B) and combined quenching (at peak A) occurred simultaneously. The interaction of <b>acetamiprid</b> with EPS was observed to have resulted in the formation of acetamiprid-EPS complexes.

40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeNeonicotinoid {{insecticides}} {{are described}} as poor agonists of mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In this paper, we provide evidence that they diffenrently act on mammalian nicotinic receptors. Experimental approachTwo-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to characterized the pharmacology of neonicotinoid insecticides on α 7 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Single and combined application of clothianidin, <b>acetamiprid</b> and thiamethoxam were tested. ResultsThe neonicotinoid insecticides, clothianidin and <b>acetamiprid</b> were partial agonists of mammalian neuronal α 7 nicotinic receptors and thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide, which is converted to clothianidin in insect and plant tissues had no effect.

Similarly, between the adsorbents used for clean up purpose activated charcoal and florisil in tandem (first from charcoal and then through florisil) yielded recoveries 82 - 90 % whereas adsorbents used alone in form of activated florisil and charcoal recovered only 70 to 78 % and 71 to 73 % <b>acetamiprid</b> residues, respectively in all vegetables and fruits. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of commonly used pesticides carbofuran and <b>acetamiprid</b> on protease enzyme activity in soils. Two types of soils with previous pesticide history, were amended with low to high concentrations (1. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 kg ha- 1) of pesticides and incubated in the laboratory at 37 oC for 40 days. Protease activity was measured during the incubation at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days interval. <b>Acetamiprid</b> and carbofuran stimulated the protease activity at lower concentrations at 10 -days interval. Striking stimulation in soil enzyme activities was noticed at 2. 5 to 5. 0 kg ha 1, persists for 20 -days in both soils. Overall, higher concentrations (7. 5 - 10. 0 kg ha- 1) of <b>acetamiprid</b> and carbofuran were toxic or innocuous to protease activity. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} neonicotinyl {{insecticides}} on integrated mite control in Washington apple was examined from 0 In {{a series of}} 20 field trials (54 treatments) designed primarily to look at efficacy against the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, {{nearly half of the}} treatments using four or more applications of <b>acetamiprid</b> had peak mite densities exceeding the economic threshold of 5 mites per leaf. Overall, <b>acetamiprid</b> treatments had 4. 6 -fold higher mite densities than the standard organophosphate insecticide treatment. Of the treatments with high mite populations, Panonychus ulmi, the European red mite, and Tetranychus urticae, the twospotted spider mite, were the dominant species in roughly equal numbers of cases. Only 11. 1 % of the thiacloprid treatments exceeded 5 mites per leaf; these experimental treatments included eight applications, whereas the current label restricts the number of applications at the rate for C. pomonella to two applications. One out of six clothianidin treatments caused a significantly higher mite density than the standard treatment; however, this material appeared to suppress predatory mites. Neonicotinyl insecticides did not eliminate predatory mites, but they inhibited their ability to respond normally to increasing prey populations. In field trials designed specifically to examine mite population densities where neonicotinyl insecticides were used, significantly higher levels of tetranychid mites occurred in one or more <b>acetamiprid</b> treatments (one, two or four applications) in five out of six trials. In the sixth trial (in a commercial orchard), only two <b>acetamiprid</b> applications were made, and mite populations were low in all treatments. While elevated mite densities were more likely to occur with four applications, in one case it occurred following a single application. The predominant tetranychid mite species (either P. ulmi or T. urticae) varied from trial to trial; however, there was no apparent bias regarding stimulation of the two species. Horticultural mineral oil was used with <b>acetamiprid</b> in some trials in an attempt to mitigate mite outbreaks. However, the addition of oil did not counteract the tendency of <b>acetamiprid</b> to increase tetranychid mite populations, and in one trial, had a negative effect on predatory mite densities. Seasonal tetranychid mite density was positively related to the total grams AI (or number of applications) of <b>acetamiprid,</b> thus reducing the number of applications per season should lower the probability of mite outbreaks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Secondary kill of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L)., by baits was {{reported}} to increase the overall control efficacy of bait products. However, most studies {{have been based on}} laboratory strains and small nymphs. We compared the secondary kill of four cockroach gel baits against various developmental stages of a laboratory (Jwax) and a field (Dorie) strain B. germanica. The four baits were: 0. 35 % <b>acetamiprid</b> (Transport), 0. 01 % fipronil (Maxforce FC), 2. 15 % hydramethylnon (Maxforce), and 0. 6 % indoxacarb (Advion). In addition, the secondary kill by <b>acetamiprid,</b> hydramethylnon, and indoxacarb was evaluated against mixed-stage cockroach populations. All baits exhibited secondary kill against various developmental stages of B. germanica. The levels of secondary mortality decreased from 100 % in the first instars to as low as 12. 1 % in adult males. The field strain was much less susceptible than the laboratory strain, with only 9. 2 - 16. 6 % secondary mortality among the 3 rd- 4 th instars. <b>Acetamiprid</b> caused significantly lower secondary mortality of the laboratory strain first instars than fipronil, hydramethylnon, and indoxacarb. In an experiment evaluating direct and secondary kill against mixed-stage populations (100 total per experimental arena), the direct kill by <b>acetamiprid,</b> hydramethylnon, and indoxacarb was 40. 0, 74. 0, and 98. 5 %, respectively. Only indoxacarb caused significant secondary kill at 0. 985 donor/recipient ratio. <b>Acetamiprid</b> and hydramethylnon did not cause detectable secondary kill at donor/recipient ratios of 0. 40 and 0. 74, respectively. We conclude the level of secondary kill by baits was highly influenced by cockroach developmental stage, strain, and donor/recipient ratio.
