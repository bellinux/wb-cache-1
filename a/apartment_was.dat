5|$|The {{footage of}} Don {{returning}} to bed after kicking Andrea {{out of the}} <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> actually reverse footage of Don {{getting out of bed}} only minutes before, which led some to believe that this was a directorial touch by Shakman to help the viewer discern the dream sequence by including unreal footage.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} {{on the second floor}} consisted of six residential rooms in addition to a foyer, kitchen, buffet, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. There were also four wine cellars on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two toilets. This <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from the front entrance.|$|E

The Chatsworth Annex <b>apartments</b> <b>were</b> demolished and replaced with greenspace and volleyball courts after the 2004-05 school year.|$|R
50|$|The Northside <b>Apartments</b> <b>are</b> an <b>apartment</b> {{complex in}} Berkeley, California, which {{are part of}} the BSC co-op system. All the <b>apartments</b> <b>are</b> studios or one-bedroom <b>apartments,</b> and <b>are</b> highly prized in BSC. Due to BSC's {{seniority}} system for allocating apartments, most of the inhabitants of the Northside <b>Apartments</b> <b>are</b> graduate students or long-term (more than 4-year) undergrads who've been members of BSC for most of their time at Berkeley.|$|R

5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} almost entirely in London. The {{directors}} somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri, {{the director of}} the first two episodes of series one and two, who used London and the River Thames as characters in themselves. The exterior and interior of Freemasons' Hall continued to be a stand-in for Thames House, the headquarters of MI5. However, the Grid, the base of operations of Section D, was a set constructed at the fifth floor in another building. Danny's <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> also filmed in the same building. Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans, which was housed near the Grid set.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the school was shot using the left wing of the then-abandoned Church of Saint Mary the Virgin building almost directly opposite the real school on West 46th Street in Times Square. The Rocky Horror Picture Show midnight screening sequence was filmed at the 8th Playhouse located on 52 West 8th Street, New York. Sal Piro, president of The Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan Club, appears as an emcee at the screening. Parker later hired Steadicam inventor and operator Garrett Brown to film Doris and Ralph's dialogue scene in a New York City Subway station. Montgomery MacNeil's <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> located on 1564 Broadway and West 46th Street, Manhattan.|$|E

50|$|The Student Apartments lie to {{the east}} of the college's {{athletic}} facilities and to the west of Claremont Boulevard. Each <b>apartment</b> <b>is</b> divided into four bedrooms and two bathrooms. Until recently, half the <b>apartments</b> <b>were</b> reserved for men and half for women, and <b>apartments</b> <b>were</b> allotted based on credits. In any given year, most of CMC's 260-300 seniors can live in the apartments.|$|R
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|Until 1902 the Portland Public Library, {{which started}} as a reading room for sailors {{and then as a}} {{subscription}} library, was housed in the building. In 1928, the city began {{one of a series of}} renovations on the building to increase floor space. That year one of the two light wells were filled in, blocking off natural light to the lower floors. The city added a new elevator in 1931. The next remodel started in 1933, and lasted through 1937. During this construction the second light well was filled in for more space, and a penthouse <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> built on top of the roof.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
50|$|The Dimmick <b>apartments</b> <b>are</b> two flats adjoined to {{the back}} of the Dimmick Dining Hall above the kitchens, and were opened in 1998. The <b>Apartments</b> <b>are</b> used for senior students.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title is}} a pun: Char Khooneh means [...] "plaid" [...] {{as well as}} [...] "four houses." [...] In the first episode, Mrs. Shokouh Jamali and her {{daughter}} Parastoo live in one <b>apartment,</b> one <b>apartment</b> <b>is</b> for Mr. Mansour Jamali when he's in the doghouse with his wife, one <b>apartment</b> <b>is</b> for the Jamalis' daughter Rana and her husband Hamed, and one <b>apartment</b> <b>is</b> vacant. It is later revealed that the apartment Mr. Jamali stays in really belongs to his son Vahid who is at university abroad in Germany. Later the vacant <b>apartment</b> <b>is</b> occupied by Farzad Paknejad and his father Farokh.|$|R

5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
25|$|After the {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia in 1968, pressure on Russia's intellectuals was stepped up by the authorities. Amalrik's <b>apartment</b> <b>was</b> twice searched, in May 1969 and February 1970.|$|E
