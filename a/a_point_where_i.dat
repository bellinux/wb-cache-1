In December 1982, Smith remarked to Melody Maker, [...] "Do the Cure really exist any more?

During a trip to Las Vegas, he {{claims to have}} won $700,000 from playing blackjack and betting on the Indianapolis Colts to defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. He went on to state, however, [...] "No matter how much I win, it ain't a lot. It's only a lot when I lose. And you always lose. I think it's fun, I think it's exciting.

[...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later.

As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes.

500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... there was <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> made the decision, and told Joe, that I {{was going to take}} my name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and I have a lot of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky first {{conducted}} {{the work in}} 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he {{brought it to the}} Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that [...] "thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras... I had reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as [...] "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} in Faith No More, Patton {{continued}} to work with Mr. Bungle. His success in mainstream rock and metal ultimately helped secure Mr. Bungle a record deal with Warner Bros. The band released a self-titled album (produced by John Zorn) in 1991, and the experimental Disco Volante in 1995. Their final album, California, was released in 1999. The band ceased being active following the 1999-2000 tour {{in support of the}} California record, although their disbandment was only officially confirmed in November of 2004. Patton explained to Rolling Stone [...] "I'm at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> now <b>where</b> <b>I</b> crave healthy musical environments, where there is a genuine exchange of ideas without repressed envy or resentment, and where people in the band want to be there regardless of what public accolades may come their way. Unfortunately, Mr. Bungle was not one of those places." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{about two}} weeks the band had around 65 pieces of music. With {{engineer}} Andy Jackson back on the team, and Bob Ezrin as co-producer, production moved to Gilmour's houseboat and recording studio, Astoria. The band listened to and voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27 pieces of music. Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they arrived at about eleven songs. Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song, a system skewed somewhat by Wright's decision to award his songs ten points each, and the other songs no points. Wright was not contractually a full member of the band, a situation which upset him. Wright reflected: [...] "It {{came very close to}} <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going to do the album, because I didn't feel that what we'd agreed was fair." [...] Wright received his first songwriting credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here.|$|E
500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt I had come to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E
500|$|Contractually, Wright was not {{a member}} of the band, and said [...] "It came close to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going to do the album." [...] However, he earned five co-writing credits on the album, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. Another {{songwriter}} credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson. She helped him write several tracks, including, [...] "High Hopes", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, [...] "pulled the whole album together," [...] according to Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: [...] "the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger". Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse, Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The album reached number 1 in both the UK and the US. It spent 51 weeks on the UK chart.|$|E

5000|$|It {{had been}} reported, {{particularly}} in the British press, that Tavener left Orthodox Christianity to explore {{a number of other}} different religious traditions, including Hinduism and Islam, and became a follower of the Traditionalist philosopher Frithjof Schuon. In an interview with The New York Times, conducted by British music journalist Michael White, Tavener said: [...] "I reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> everything <b>I</b> wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the Orthodox Church, and I felt the need, in my music at least, to become more universalist: to take in other colors, other languages." [...] The interviewer also reported {{at the time that he}} [...] "hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian." [...] Speaking on the BBC Four television programme Sacred Music in 2010, Tavener described himself as [...] "essentially Orthodox". He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on Start the Week, recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11 November 2013.|$|R
500|$|Tweedy {{felt the}} new members {{gave him a}} new {{opportunity}} {{to contribute to the}} band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: [...] "It just seemed like it reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> Jeff and <b>I</b> really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record." ...|$|R
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

5000|$|B.o.B {{said his}} {{decision}} to include guest appearances came from the previous installments in his Elements series not having any at all: [...] "For this Ether project I kinda opened the doorway for more outside influences, because the Elements project I put out, it was all me, I didn't want nobody touching it, because {{it had to be}} that way. But to finish it off with the fifth element, I just felt like I wanted to really make it more of a grandiose grand finale". In an interview with Complex, B.o.B said: [...] "All the features is just really people who I fuck with. I don’t collaborate with everybody, man, and I’m at <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> … <b>I</b> just want to work with people who I gel with and vibe with. Even if I collaborate with the same artist six times, I’m still going to keep doing it." [...] It was revealed in an interview that the album's fourth track [...] "Peace Piece", featuring vocals and production from Big K.R.I.T., was originally given to T.I. for his Us or Else: Letter to the System project. In an interview with Fuse, B.o.B said he produced about half of the album, adding [...] "Jacque Beatz and 30 Roc did a lot of production." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite the label's aspirations, Jay Farrar {{announced}} {{his intention to}} leave Uncle Tupelo in January 1994. Farrar kept his reasoning secret until fall 1995, when he claimed {{in an interview that}} [...] "it reached <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> Jeff and <b>I</b> really weren't compatible." [...] As a sign of loyalty to band manager Tony Margherita, who had acquired a $3000 debt on behalf of the band, Farrar agreed to do another promotional tour. Physical altercations between Tweedy and Farrar began two weeks into the tour and continued throughout—many were due to Farrar's refusal to play on Tweedy's songs. Despite Farrar's reservations, Uncle Tupelo performed Tweedy's [...] "The Long Cut" [...] on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, the band's only network television appearance. The band played their final concert on May 1, 1994 at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, Missouri. The remaining members of the Anodyne sessions formed Wilco a few weeks later.|$|R

At his father's encouragement, Foster moved in with his uncle in Sylmar, Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music. Foster worked various jobs and at night, he attended parties in Hollywood to expand his social network. He said, [...] "I felt like an 18-year-old Hunter S. Thompson. I was just diving into this Hollywood Hills subculture and taking it all in. I wasn't shy about taking my guitar out at a party. I wanted {{to be the center of}} attention." [...] At one time, he roomed with actor Brad Renfro. Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, [...] "It got pretty dark.

We saw where beavers had gnawed down aspens, and we just escaped miring our horses in marshes, where the grass grew, rich and golden, hiding the treacherous mire.

I judged that Mr. Parable had come from the Houses of Parliament, and the next morning my suspicions were confirmed by reading that he had been present at a tea-party given on the terrace by Mr. Will Crooks. Mr. Parable conveyed to me the suggestion of a man absorbed in thought, and not quite aware of what he was doing; but in this, of course, I may have been mistaken.
