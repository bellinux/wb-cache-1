5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E

50|$|The German 8×68mm S {{cartridge}} {{introduced in}} 1939 {{is probably the}} closest ballistic twin of the 8mm Remington Magnum. The 8×68mm S is however <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim cartridge.|$|R
2500|$|The [...]41 AE {{was doomed}} by {{circumstance}} to obscurity, {{but the concept}} of using <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim to allow easy cartridge interchangeability was not lost. [...] The [...]50 Action Express, developed by Magnum Research for the Desert Eagle pistol, uses <b>a</b> similar <b>rebated</b> rim {{that is the same}} diameter as the [...]44 Magnum. This allows a caliber change with replacement of just the barrel and magazine.|$|R

25|$|Most recently, in August 2009, Fairfield University {{became the}} first {{university}} in the United States to install Tomra UNO reverse vending machines (RVM), an all-in-one recycling machine, allowing students to deposit plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers for <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> of a nickel.|$|E
25|$|The {{funding of}} {{healthcare}} in Australia by Medicare {{is referred to}} as <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> or benefit. The difference between the cost of healthcare and the rebate is called an out-of-pocket cost. The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{sale was}} later {{the cause of}} a lawsuit in 1886 against the Maillers and McGregor when Mr Edwarde and Mr Bell {{attempted}} to recover A£78,582 for a short delivery on the delivery of stock from the station. The plaintiffs complained that there were only 9,000 cattle and 400 sheep instead of 12,000 cattle and 2,000 sheep as a minimum as promised. The defendants offered <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> of A£7,752. The court found in favour of the plaintiffs, but charges of fraud against the defendants were dropped.|$|E
5000|$|The American [...]300 Dakota {{proprietary}} cartridge, {{based on}} the [...]404 Jeffery case, is probably the closest currently (2008) commercially available ballistic twin of the 7.62mm UKM. The [...]300 Dakota is however <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim cartridge.|$|R

However, in the 2008 budget, the clean-car rebate will be scrapped in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate {{program is}} {{provided}} for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; {{and people with}} disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for <b>a</b> <b>rebate.</b> Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.|$|E
25|$|Both {{major parties}} had their {{official}} campaign launches in Brisbane, Queensland; the Liberal Party on Monday 12 November and Labor on Wednesday 14 November. At their launch, the Coalition pledged <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> for education costs, including private school fees, of all Australian children, totalling $9.4billion. Under the plan, primary school students {{would have been}} eligible for $400, while secondary-school students would have been eligible for $800. Tax cuts worth $1.6billion over four years were proposed {{to encourage people to}} save for first homes, and extra funding of $652million for child care and $158million to support carers was promised.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]50 Beowulf uses <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim design. This round {{is used in}} {{specialized}} AR-15 upper receivers, and the rim {{matches the}} size of the rim of the 7.62×39mm, allowing those parts {{to be used in the}} custom-built upper receivers.|$|R

25|$|The first weather {{derivative}} deal was in July 1996 when Aquila Energy structured a dual-commodity hedge for Consolidated Edison (ConEd). The transaction involved ConEd's purchase of electric power from Aquila {{for the month}} of August. The price of the power was agreed, and a weather clause was embedded into the contract. This clause stipulated that Aquila would pay ConEd <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> if August turned out to be cooler than expected. The measurement of this was referenced to Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) measured at New York City's Central Park weather station. If total CDDs were from 0 to 10% below the expected 320, the company received no discount to the power price, but if total CDDs were 11 to 20% below normal, ConEd would receive a $16,000 discount. Other discounted levels were worked in for even greater departures from normal.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011 Massow set up Pay Me My, {{a trading}} name of Massows Limited, which offered {{customers}} <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> of 80% of the 'trail' commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies {{to the agency}} of Pay Me My, who would take 20% as their fee. Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions {{that it would not}} be viable following changes to financial regulation in the UK due to start on 1 January 2013; however, it ceased trading in August 2013 after it announced that its business model was loss making and could not be sustained. The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated. This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission.|$|E
25|$|Benton Area School District {{residents}} {{may also}} {{qualify for the}} Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. It is provided for several groups of school district residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 still qualify for <b>a</b> <b>rebate.</b> Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.|$|E

5000|$|One {{example of}} <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim {{cartridge}} is the [...]50 Action Express (or [...]50 AE), commonly chambered in the Desert Eagle pistol. In order to simplify production, and {{to decrease the}} cost of ownership, the [...]50 AE was designed with <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim which matched {{the diameter of the}} rim of the [...]44 Magnum, which was the most common caliber used in the Desert Eagle. By using the same rim dimensions as the [...]44 Magnum, a Desert Eagle could be converted from [...]44 Magnum to [...]50 AE by merely changing the barrel and magazine. Other convertible cartridges, such as the short-lived [...]41 Action Express (with the same rim diameter as 9×19mm Parabellum) used in the Jericho 941 convertible pistol and Uzi submachine gun and carbine, would function in the same magazine, and thus required only a barrel change to change caliber.|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} effects of rebate rules on {{voluntary}} contributions to a threshold public good. Rebate rules specify how excess contributions, over the threshold amount are distributed. We examine three <b>rebate</b> rules experimentally: <b>a</b> no <b>rebate</b> policy where excess contributions are discarded, <b>a</b> proportional <b>rebate</b> policy where excess contributions are <b>rebated</b> proportionally to <b>an</b> individual 2 ̆ 7 s contribution, and <b>a</b> utilization <b>rebate</b> policy where excess contributions provide some continuous public good. Significantly more Nash equilibrium outcomes are observed under the no rebate treatment than under either of the other two. Interestingly, the variance of contributions differs significantly between rebate treatments...|$|R
25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a repair done on the {{portside}} hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was manufactured with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block and fastened by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore caulked, a section of wood around the transom removed, and the repair block inserted and the transom finished.|$|E

25|$|Flue-cured Virginia tobacco {{became the}} favoured crop of many European {{planters}} in the Shire Highlands {{in the second}} decade of the 20th century. The areas farmed rose from 4,507 acres in 1911 to 10,489 acres in 1913 and 14,218 acres in 1920, yielding an average tobacco crop of 407 pounds an acre. Before 1920, only about 5% of the crop marketed was dark-fired tobacco produced by African farmers, but this rose to about 1 million pounds or 14% by 1923. The First World War boosted the production of European-farmed, flue-cured Virginia leaf, but post-war competition from the United States Virginia prompted <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> one-sixth of import duties to assist Empire growers. Much of the tobacco produced by Nyasaland’s European estates, particularly by smaller growers, was of low-grade and often unsaleable. In 1921, only 1,500 tons of a 3,500 ton crop could be sold immediately: {{the cost of the}} relatively expensive flue-curing process (when overproduction was leading to reduced sale prices) made low-grade tobacco unprofitable, and put the smaller European growers out of business. Europeans produced 86% of Nyasaland’s tobacco in 1924, but only 57% in 1927 and 28% in 1933.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the Jericho 941 also introduced a new caliber to the market, the [...]41 Action Express (or [...]41 AE), which was developed in 1986. [...] The [...]41 AE was <b>a</b> unique <b>rebated</b> rim cartridge designed to use [...]410-inch (10.25 mm) bullets and duplicate a reduced power police loading of the [...]41 Magnum. [...] The Jericho originally shipped with two barrels, one for 9×19mm Parabellum {{and the other for}} [...]41 AE. Since the [...]41 AE was designed with <b>a</b> <b>rebated</b> rim the same dimensions as that of the 9 mm, the extractor and ejector worked equally well for either cartridge.|$|R

25|$|The {{competitive}} market {{did not actually}} open until May 2002. Participation in the retail market was voluntary, with customers having the option of entering into contracts or rates being set in the five-minute spot market. Retail consumers were also free to enter fixed-rate contracts. For those that opted out of the contract option, electricity rates passed through a smoothed spot market price. When the market opened in May, wholesale prices averaged 3.01 cents per kWh. For a number of reasons, however, including an especially hot summer, a reduction in domestic generating capacity, and an increasing reliance on a limited import capacity, prices began to rise sharply. In July, average wholesale price was 6.2 cents per kWh. Under surmounting pressure from consumers, the government adopted the Electricity Pricing, Conservation and Supply (EPCS) Act in December 2002. The legislation capped retail prices at 4.3 cents per kWh and Ontario Power Generation (the successor of Ontario Hydro's electricity generation division) was to provide customers with <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> for 100% of all electricity charges above that mark, retroactive to the market opening and continuing until 1 May 2006. Transmission and distribution rates were also frozen at their existing levels and would remain unchanged until 1 May 2006. The net result was a complete cessation of new investment in generation capacity and a significant cutback in new investment in transmission and distribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the FairTax on the {{distribution}} of the tax burden is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that it would decrease tax burdens, broaden the tax base, be progressive, increase purchasing power, and tax wealth, while opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. Sales taxes are normally considered regressive; however, the FairTax provides <b>a</b> <b>rebate</b> that supporters argue would create a progressive effective rate on consumption. Under the FairTax, a low-income family may spend $25,000 on goods and services consuming 100% of their income. A higher income family making $100,000 may spend $80,000 on goods and services and save $20,000. The higher income family is consuming only 80% of their income on taxable goods and services. According to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive (using a cross-section time frame). However, when presented with an estimated effective tax rate, the low-income family above would pay a tax rate of 0% on the 100% of consumption and the higher income family would pay a tax rate of 15% on the 80% of consumption. The effective tax rate is progressive on consumption. Using a larger time frame, the other 20% would be consumed and taxed {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E
