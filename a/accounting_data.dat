50|$|A {{theoretical}} SAM always balances, but empirically estimated SAM’s {{never do}} in the first collation. This {{is due to the}} problem of converting national <b>accounting</b> <b>data</b> into money flows and the introduction of non-SNA data, compounded by issues of inconsistent national <b>accounting</b> <b>data</b> (which is prevalent for many developing nations, while developed nations tend to include a SAM version of the national account, generally precise to within 1% of GDP). This was noted as early as 1984 by Mansur and Whalley, and numerous techniques have been devised to ‘adjust’ SAMs, as “inconsistent data estimated with error, is a common experience in many countries”.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of player account-based gambling {{is a result}} of escalating technological sophistication and the incorporation of these developments into gambling. This term refers to gambling from a centralized account that is linked to an identified individual. Player account-based gambling is increasingly being utilized for multiple forms of Internet, mobile and land-based gambling through player cards and user-names. Player accounts track and store a wealth of data on gambling behaviour and related activities. Gambling research has been justifiably criticized for its reliance on self-report rather than behavioural measures. Research analysing player <b>account</b> <b>data</b> may advance conceptual models, identify behavioural risk factors for problem gambling and evaluate and guide effective policy and responsible gambling programmes. Although research utilizing player <b>account</b> <b>data</b> has unique limitations, it offers considerable benefits for researchers, operators and regulators.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a switch from fixed-weighted national <b>accounts</b> <b>data</b> to chain-type {{data in the}} quarterly macroeconometric model Mona. As in other countries {{the idea behind this}} change in the national <b>accounts</b> <b>data</b> has been to reduce the substitution bias, which has grown with the amount of high-technology goods with a weak price development deviating from the average. In line with Lasky (1998) we demonstrate that the use of the chain index can also reduce some of the typical aggregation problems in macro econometric models based on traditional fixed-weight relations. Chain-type national <b>accounts</b> <b>data</b> are not perfect as e. g. their lack of additivity makes them more complex to work with. We demonstrate that also the lack of reversibility in the chain index may complicate some model results by leading to permanent effects from temporary chocks. It is not clear a priori if a switch to chain weights in the definitional relations on balance improve the model...|$|R

Specifying utility as a nonhomothetic function of both luxury and basic consumption goods, we derive pricing equations and evaluate the risk of holding equity. Household survey and national <b>accounts</b> <b>data</b> mostly reflect basic consumption, and therefore overstate the risk aversion necessary to match the observed equity premium. The risk aversion implied by the consumption of luxury goods {{is more than an}} order of magnitude less than that implied by national <b>accounts</b> <b>data.</b> For the very rich, the equity premium is much less of a puzzle...|$|R
