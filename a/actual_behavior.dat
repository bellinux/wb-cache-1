Volition {{is seen as a}} process that leads from intention to <b>actual</b> <b>behavior.</b> In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in orchestration to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.|$|E

In 1954, Edward Teller held a gathering of fusion researchers at the Princeton Gun Club, near the Project Matterhorn (now known as Project Sherwood) grounds. Teller started by pointing out the problems that everyone was having, and suggested that any system where the plasma was confined within concave fields was doomed to fail. Attendees remember him saying something to the effect that the fields were like rubber bands, and they would attempt to snap back to a straight configuration whenever the power was increased, ejecting the plasma. He went on to say that it appeared the only way to confine the plasma in a stable configuration would be to use convex fields, a [...] "cusp" [...] configuration.|$|E

2500|$|Behavioral Checklists and Scales: {{behaviors}} are more definite than traits. [...] The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns [...] "specific behaviors indicative of {{good or bad}} job performance". [...] Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors. [...] A discussion on performance may then follow. [...] The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. [...] Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated {{in the terms of}} critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed {{in the same way as}} for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts.
