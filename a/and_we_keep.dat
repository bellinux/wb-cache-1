2500|$|Rabbi Itzikl's son by {{his third}} wife Chana Sima, Reb Dovidl, succeeded his father as Skverer Rebbe. He {{was known to be}} ascetic and {{exceedingly}} reticent. He once said, [...] "Men shvagt un men shvagt, dernoch riet men abisl un men shvagt vater" [...] ("We keep silent <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> silent; then we rest a bit, and go on keeping silent").|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, former RCMP {{commissioner}} Giuliano Zaccardelli, {{now with}} Interpol, {{said that the}} White House [...] "threw away the rule book" [...] after 9/11 and that the RCMP was {{led to believe that}} Arar would be sent back to Canada from New York. Zaccardelli told the CBC that US authorities said that they didn't have enough evidence to lay charges against Arar and wanted to know whether Arar would be arrested if he returned to Canada. [...] "The discussion was: 'If we let him go and he comes to Canada, can you arrest him or detain him?' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> reaffirming, 'No we can't'," [...] Zaccardelli said.|$|E
2500|$|Yorke {{wrote of}} meeting Donwood at university: [...] "He {{had a better}} hat and suit on than me. That pissed me off. So I figured I'd either end up really not liking this person at all, or working {{with him for the}} rest of my life." [...] Donwood said his first {{impression}} of Yorke was that he was [...] "mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with." [...] Whereas Donwood, in his own words, has a [...] "tendency towards Virgo-like detailing and perfectionism", Yorke is [...] "completely opposed, fucking everything up ... I do something, then he fucks it up, then I fuck up what he’s done … <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> doing that until we’re happy with the result. It’s a competition to see who 'wins' the painting, which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way." [...] Yorke is credited for Radiohead artwork alongside Donwood under the monikers [...] "The White Chocolate Farm", [...] "Tchock", [...] "Dr. Tchock" [...] or similar abbreviations.|$|E

60|$|We have {{in such a}} {{difficulty}} as that of fitting a standing army to the state, he conceived, done much better. We have not distracted our army by divided principles of obedience. We have put them under a single authority, with a simple (our common) oath of fidelity; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> the whole under our annual inspection. This was doing all that could be safely done.|$|E
60|$|There are eighty-two {{millions}} of us people that use this orthography, and {{it ought to be}} simplified in our behalf, but it is kept in its present condition to satisfy one million people who like to have their literature in the old form. That looks to me to be rather selfish, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> the forms as they are while we have got one million people coming in here from foreign countries every year and they have got to struggle with this orthography of ours, and it keeps them back and damages their citizenship for years until they learn to spell the language, if they ever do learn. This is merely sentimental argument.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{well as your}} gamekeepers in England {{know which}} covert may be drawn for foxes. Yes; 'tis a royal sport, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> it for Maharajahs. I myself never hunt a tiger till some European visitor of {{distinction}} comes to Moozuffernuggar, that I may show him good sport. This tiger we shall hunt to-morrow, for example, he is a bad old hand. He has carried off the buffaloes of my villagers over yonder for years and years, and of late he has also become a man-eater. He once ate a whole family at a meal--a man, his wife, and his three children. The people at Janwargurh have been pestering me for weeks to come and shoot him; and each week he has eaten somebody--a child or a woman; the last was yesterday--but I waited till you came, because I {{thought it would be}} something to show you that you would not be likely to see elsewhere.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{answered}} Superstition, [...] "Cruelty works cunningest {{when he is}} afraid; and Liveloose never {{talks about}} himself. None the less there's not a tree but casts a shadow. I met once an earnest yet very popular young gentleman {{of the name of}} Science, who explained almost everything on earth to me so clearly, and patiently, and fatherly, I thought I should evermore sleep in peace. But we met at noon. Believe me, sir, I would have followed Christian and his friend Hopeful very willingly long since; for as for Cruelty and Obstinate and all that clumsy rabble, I heed them not. Indeed my cousin Mistrust did go, and as you see returned with a caution; and a poor young school-fellow of mine, Jack Ignorance, came to an awful end. But it is because I owe partly to Christian and not all to myself this horrible solitude in which I walk that I dare not risk a deeper. It would be, I feel sure. And so I very willingly beheld Faithful burned; it restored my confidence. And here, sir," [...] he added, almost with gaiety, [...] "lives my friend Mrs. Simple, a widow. She enjoys my company and my old fables, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> the blinds down against these mountains, and candles burning against the brighter lightnings." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{it often}} is with us, we take a course, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> to it, {{as if we were}} infallible, and we allow nothing to alter our convictions. We persuade {{ourselves}} that we are right, and we hold on our course unmoved. Death steps in: and now, when the past is irrevocable, the scales that have so long darkened our eyes, fall at once to the ground, and we see that we were wrong after all. How much cruel conduct, how many harsh words, how many little unkindnesses do we wish unspoken and undone when we look upon a dead face we have loved, or stand by the side of a new-made grave! how we wish--how we wish that we could but have the time over again! Perhaps in past times we were quite content with our own conduct; we had no doubts in our mind but that we always did what was right and kind, and that we were in every way doing our duty. But now in what a different light do right and duty appear! how we regret that we ever caused tears to flow from those dear eyes, now never to open again! why could we not have made those small concessions which would have cost us so little, why were we so hard upon that trifling fault, why so impatient with that little failing? Ah me! ah me! if we could but live our lives over again, how different, oh, how different it should be! And yet while we say this, we do not think that there are others yet alive upon whose faults we are just as hard, with whose failings we bear just as little, and that these, too, may some day go down into the quiet grave, and that we may again have to stand beside and cry [...] "peccavi." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{did not go}} to Rome last winter, {{in spite}} of the spirits of the sun who {{declared}} from Lord Stanhope's crystal ball, you remember, that we should. And we don't go to England till next summer, because we must see Rome next winter, and must lie perdus in Italy meantime. I have had a happy winter in Florence, recovered my lost advantages in point of health, been busy and tranquil, had plenty of books and talk, and seen my child grow rosier and prettier (said aside) every day. Robert and I are talking of going up to the monasteries beyond Vallombrosa for a day or two, on mule-back through forests and mountains. We have had an excursion to Prato (less difficult) already, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> various dreams in our heads to be acted out on occasion. Our favorite friend here is a brother of Alfred Tennyson's, himself a poet, but most admirable to me for his simplicity and truth. Robert is very fond of him. Then we like Powers--of the 'Greek Slave'--Swedenborgian and spiritualist; and Mr. Lytton, Sir Edward's son, who is with us often, and always a welcome visitor. All these confederate friends are ranged with me on the believing side with regard to the phenomena, and Robert has to keep us at bay as he best can. Oh, do tell me what you can. Your account deeply interested me. We have heard many more intimate personal relations from Americans who brush us with their garments as they pass through Florence, and I should like to talk these things over with you. Paid mediums, as paid clairvoyants in general, excite a prejudice; yet, perhaps, not reasonably. The curious fact in this movement is, however, the degree in which it works within private families in America. Has anything of the kind appeared in England? And has the motion of the tables ever taken the form of alphabetical expression, which has been the case in America? I had a letter from Athens the other day, mentioning that 'nothing was talked of there except moving tables and spiritual manifestations.' (The writer was not a believer.) Even here, from the priest to the Mazzinian, they are making circles. An engraving of a spinning table at a shop window bears this motto: 'E pur si muove!' That's adroit for Galileo's land, isn't it? Now mind you tell me whatever you hear and see. How does Mrs. Crowe decide? By the way, I was glad to observe by the papers that she has had a dramatic success.|$|E
