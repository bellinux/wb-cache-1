25|$|H. G. Wells was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story In the Abyss. The idea for The Abyss came to James Cameron when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture <b>about</b> <b>deep</b> sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who {{was the first}} human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Dr. Johannes A. Kylstra. He subsequently wrote a short story that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory {{at the bottom of the}} ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details evolved over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers. While making Aliens, Cameron saw a National Geographic film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story. He and producer Gale Anne Hurd decided that The Abyss would be their next film. Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987. Cameron and Hurd were married before The Abyss, separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.|$|E

500|$|Sperm whales usually dive between , and {{sometimes}} , {{in search of}} food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the giant squid, but also the colossal squid, octopuses, and fish like demersal rays, but their diet is mainly medium-sized squid. Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items. Most {{of what is known}} <b>about</b> <b>deep</b> sea squid has been learned from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs, although more recent studies analysed feces. One study, carried out around the Galápagos, found that squid from the genera Histioteuthis (62%), Ancistrocheirus (16%), and Octopoteuthis (7%) weighing between [...] were the most commonly taken. Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid. Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside down at the bottom of their deep dives. It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light.|$|E

He could feel for these poor wild foresters and {{mountain}} shepherds; he could understand what was in their hearts; for he knew the heart of man; and, therefore, he could make them understand him. And it was for this very reason, one might suppose, that our Lord was willing to be brought up at Nazareth, that he might learn the country speech, and country ways, and that the people might grow to look on {{him as one of}} themselves. Those Scribes and Pharisees, one may suppose, were just the people whom they could not understand; fine, rich scholars, proud people talking very learnedly <b>about</b> <b>deep</b> doctrines. The country folk must have looked at them as if they belonged to some other world, and said,--Those Pharisees cannot understand us, any more than we can them, with their hard rules about this and that.

6000|$|Her {{treatment}} of Mrs. Bunting would be incredible {{if we did}} not know that, in spite of many disadvantages, the Sea Lady was an extremely well read person.

For a time there was a friendly intimacy--so Melville always preferred to present it--between these two, and my cousin, who has a fairly considerable amount of curiosity, learnt many very interesting details about the life [...] "out there" [...] or [...] "down there"--for the Sea Lady used either expression. At first the Sea Lady was exceedingly reticent under the gentle insistence of his curiosity, but after a time, I gather, she gave way to bursts of cheerful confidence. [...] "It is clear," [...] says my cousin, [...] "that the old ideas of the submarine life as a sort of perpetual game of 'who-hoop' through groves of coral, diversified by moonlight hair-combings on rocky strands, need very extensive modification." [...] In this matter of literature, for example, they have practically all that we have, and unlimited leisure to read it in. Melville is very insistent upon and rather envious of that unlimited leisure. A picture of a mermaid swinging in a hammock of woven seaweed, with what bishops call a [...] "latter-day" [...] novel {{in one hand and a}} sixteen candle-power phosphorescent fish in the other, may jar upon one's preconceptions, but it is certainly far more in accordance with the picture of the abyss she printed on his mind. Everywhere Change works her will on things. Everywhere, and even among the immortals, Modernity spreads. Even on Olympus I suppose there is a Progressive party and a new Phaeton agitating to supersede the horses of his father by some solar motor of his own. I suggested as much to Melville and he said [...] "Horrible! Horrible!" [...] and stared hard at my study fire. Dear old Melville!
