5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case is <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners.

Radical militant groups in Somalia have banned the watching of televised World Cup matches, and had initially threatened to punish with public floggings, declaring the World Cup <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> resources and un-Islamic. There were reports that groups had arrested people for watching the World Cup. The group denied reports of arresting people, but said that they were chasing people out of video halls.|$|E
25|$|Loerzer was out {{of contact}} with Reichenau's command post for three days, while Richthofen was soon {{complaining}} to Löhr about the former's ignorance. Because he was impetuous {{and wanted to be}} in the thick of the action, Richthofen began flying around over the frontline in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, as air-ground liaison collapsed. His claims were not always believed, and these personal operations were <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> needlessly exposed him to danger. Indeed, Major Spielvogel was shot down over Warsaw in his Storch on 9 September, and killed. While the operational situation was not good, Löhr took command of Fliegerführer z.b.V., giving the unit virtual autonomy and allowing Richthofen to build a personal empire of six Gruppen (Groups).|$|E
25|$|By 21 May the Allied armies were encircled and counterattacks {{had been}} repulsed at Arras. The Allies were {{evacuating}} the ports of Dunkirk and Calais. During the Battle of Dunkirk and Siege of Calais (1940), Richthofen supported {{the advance of}} Army Groups A and B in these operations. His command were frequently meeting Royal Air Force (RAF) fighters, flying across the Channel. Richthofen noted RAF Fighter Command and its No. 11 Group RAF were responsible for 25 per cent of German losses. Richthofen helped capture Calais and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 23 May. Richthofen was ordered to support the German Fourth Army, though he showed {{little interest in the}} Dunkirk battles. He regarded them as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> they disrupted preparations against southern France (Case Red). He believed the attempt to destroy Allied forces, or prevent the evacuation with the Luftwaffe was unrealistic. Over Dunkirk, losses were heavy and progress slow. On 26 May, Richthofen made a special effort to gain and hold air superiority. Overall, German air power failed to prevent the evacuation.|$|E

500|$|Each episode took {{approximately}} {{two months to}} edit, and editing usually began as the episodes were still being shot. The editors would work on two episodes simultaneously. Following {{the completion of the}} episodes, Muskett added the score for them. The episodes include split screen sequences. Although the sequences were presented in a similar vein to the American action series 24, the split screen idea did not come from the show itself; Nalluri thought of it independently after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up. The series also introduced the premise of not including any production credits. The producers agreed that adding credits would be <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> that the viewers would pay no attention to them. However, they also saw this as an opportunity; as Spooks is a spy show, Wolstencroft had the idea that it would be [...] "cool" [...] to have a show that was anonymous, and it would fit the spirit of the series.|$|E

500|$|During {{the voyage}} Morrell {{experienced}} several {{encounters with the}} slave trade, first at the Cape Verde Islands, then a centre for the trade because of its geographical position {{in relation to the}} Americas, Europe and Africa. He found the slaves' conditions wretched, but was impressed by their passion for music which, he thought, [...] "can alleviate even the pangs caused by the galling fetters of slavery". Later in the voyage he witnessed what he describes as [...] "horrid barbarity", including the spectacle of two women slaves in their death agonies as a result of floggings. A lengthy soliloquy in his journal on the evils of slavery concludes: [...] "he root, the source, the foundation of the evil is the ignorance and superstition of the poor negroes themselves". On June 8, 1829, Morrell wrote in his journal: [...] "The voyage had been prosperous beyond our expectations, and any further stay on the African coast would have been <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money".

He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings, and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up. He disliked eloquence, writing that [...] "If the judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> loss of words, and if they are weak, and easily wrought upon, it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and biassing their affections."
