500|$|Since it {{was first}} {{described}} in 1905, Tyrannosaurus rex {{has become the most}} widely recognized dinosaur species in popular culture. It is the only dinosaur that is commonly known to the general public by its full scientific name (binomial name) (Tyrannosaurus rex), and the scientific abbreviation T.rex has also come into wide usage. Robert T. Bakker notes this in The Dinosaur Heresies and explains that <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Tyrannosaurus rex is just irresistible to the tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Did I Stutter?" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer and Brent Forrester. Although the two writers {{initially}} planned to write separate episodes, the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike forced the two to share an episode. Forrester and Spitzer initially disagreed about what the episode's title should be. Forrester wanted to name it [...] "Did I Stutter?"—a phrase popularized by Judd Nelson's character Bender in the 1985 film The Breakfast Club—while Spitzer wanted <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> [...] "The Reprimand" [...] or [...] "Insubordination". Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg wrote the scenes featuring Andy and Angela playing Mad Libs. Justin Spitzer called the sequence [...] "amazing".|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>names</b> <b>like</b> [...] "bearded tit" [...] imply, {{their general}} habitus and acrobatic habits {{resemble}} birds like the long-tailed tits. Together with these and others {{they were at}} some time placed in the titmouse family Paridae. Later studies found no justification to presume a close relationship between all these birds, and consequently the parrotbills and bearded reedling {{were removed from the}} tits and chickadees and placed into a distinct family, Paradoxornithidae. <b>As</b> <b>names</b> <b>like</b> Paradoxornis paradoxus - [...] "puzzling, paradox bird" [...] - suggest, their true relationships were very unclear, although by the latter 20th century they were generally seen as close to Timaliidae ("Old World babblers") and Sylviidae ("Old World warblers").|$|R

2500|$|As a critic, Ford {{is known}} for {{remarking}} [...] "Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, {{and the quality of}} the whole will be revealed to you." [...] George Seldes, in his book Witness to a Century, describes Ford ("probably in 1932") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co-author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: [...] "'and he disowns me now that he has become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes." [...] Ford says, [...] "I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> Hemingway." [...] Seldes observes, [...] "At this climax Ford began to sob. Then he began to cry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Babylonian Talmud {{mentions}} Metatron in {{two other}} places: Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zarah 3b. In Sanhedrin 38b a Minim tells Rabbi Idith that Metatron should be worshiped because he has <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> his master. Rabbi Idith uses the same passage Exodus 23:21 to show that Metatron was an angel and not a deity and thus should not be worshiped. Furthermore, as an angel Metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor was he to be received even as a messenger of forgiveness. Avodah Zarah 3b: In the fourth quarter God sits and instructs the school children. In the preceding three quarters Metatron may take God's place or God may do this among other tasks. B Yevamot 16b records an utterance attributed to the Prince of the World. [...] "I have been young and now I am old." [...] In rabbinic tradition this utterance is attributed to Metatron.|$|E
2500|$|Frank Mahan, one of {{the players}} from the {{original}} first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. [...] Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started. [...] Mahan suggested that it be called [...] "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> that would kill any game. [...] Mahan then said, [...] "Why not call it basketball?" [...] Naismith replied, [...] "We have a basket and a ball, {{and it seems to me}} that would be a good name for it." [...] The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from , on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.|$|E
