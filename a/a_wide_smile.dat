25|$|At Woo-jin's penthouse, Woo-jin {{reveals the}} truth, that Mi-do is Dae-su's daughter. Woo-jin had {{arranged}} their meeting by using hypnosis to guide Dae-su into the sushi restaurant, {{hoping that they}} would fall in love, so that Dae-su might experience the same pain which Woo-jin had. Dae-su attempts to attack Woo-jin but is beaten badly, until Woo-jin intervenes, killing his own bodyguard. Woo-jin proceeds to threaten {{to tell the truth}} to Mi-do, who is being held by Mr. Park in his new prison. Dae-su apologizes for driving Woo-jin's sister to suicide and begs him not to tell Mi-do. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a symbol of penance. Woo-jin accepts Dae-su's pleading, and tells Mr Park to keep the truth from Mi-do. Woo-jin then boards the elevator, recalls the events of his sister's suicide, and shoots himself {{in the head with a}} Derringer pistol. In the aftermath of the event, Dae-su finds the hypnotist from the prison to erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter, so that they can stay together and have a nice relationship. Mi-do then finds Dae-su and embraces him. Dae-su breaks into <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>smile,</b> which is then slowly replaced by a look of pain, bringing into question whether the hypnosis worked.|$|E

For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'"

I'll ask a question or two of his parents as I ride home this afternoon--respectable people--to confirm some particulars in his own account of himself; and that done, Mr Gills, I'll send him round to you to-morrow morning. Goodbye!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{wish you}} might know John A. Pescud. He is {{of the stuff that}} heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of. He is a small man with <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>smile,</b> and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose. I never saw him wear but one kind of necktie, and he {{believes}} in cuff-holders and button-shoes. He is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the Cambria Steel Works; and he believes that as soon as Pittsburgh makes smoke-consumers compulsory, St. Peter will come down and sit at the foot of Smithfield Street, and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven. He believes that [...] "our" [...] plate-glass is the most important commodity in the world, and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and law-abiding.|$|E

60|$|Then {{there was}} a {{welcoming}} of Captain Bob by pulling out his arms like drawers and shutting them again, smacking {{him on the back}} as if he were choking, holding him at arm's length as if he were of too large type to read close.

50|$|These {{were the}} shortest-serving mascots of the show, {{appearing}} {{only in the}} sixth season. Boom was an orange, pink-haired, frog-like creature which wore a brown tuxedo, boater hat and a cane. It always sported <b>a</b> <b>wide,</b> happy <b>smile,</b> and moved vigorously and cheerfully. For its part, Crack reminded of a green lizard, with barely four locks of hair. It wore a torn tuxedo and hat, always looked sad, and showed a great clumsiness. Their function in the auction was identical to Chollo and Antichollo before them: Boom gave the contestants the possibility of winning whichever prize they chose, while Crack meant leaving empty-handed.|$|R
6000|$|When old Mr. Scott was {{informed}} what had happened, {{he put down}} his newspaper, took off his spectacles, and <b>smiled</b> <b>a</b> strange, <b>wide</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I have been reading," [...] he said, [...] "about a little machine, or box, that you can talk into and then cork up and send by mail across the ocean to anybody you know there. And then he can uncork it, and out will come all you have said in your very words and voice, with the sniffles and sneezes that might have got in accidental. So that {{if one of the}} Old Testament Egyptians that they've been diggin' up lately had had one of these boxes with him it might have been uncorked and people could have heard in his own voice just who he was and what was his personal opinion of Moses and his brother Aaron. Now, when an old man like me has just come to know of a thing of this kind, it isn't for him to have a word to say when he is told that Lilian Budworth is to be his step-grandmother; he must take it in along with the other wonders." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{precursor}} to Kool-Aid Man, the Pitcher Man, was created on July 10, 1954 by Marvin Potts, an art director for a New York advertising agency hired by General Foods {{to create an}} image that would accompany the slogan [...] "A 5-cent package makes two quarts." [...] Inspired by watching his young son draw smiley faces on a frosted window, Potts created the Pitcher Man, a glass pitcher with <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>smile</b> emblazoned on its side and filled with Kool-Aid. It {{was one of several}} designs Potts created but the only one that stuck, and General Foods began to use the Pitcher Man in all of its advertisements.|$|E

[...] before Nardwuar freezes with <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>smile</b> until the camera cuts off. When asked to explain his name, Nardwuar has said it is “a dumb, stupid name like Sting or Sinbad;” and that “Human” came from the song [...] "Human Fly" [...] by The Cramps; and “Serviette” came {{from the fact that}} “in the U.S.A. they don’t have serviettes, they have napkins”.|$|E

40|$|In 1985 the Paris metro ran an {{advertising}} campaign using {{an image of}} a young black woman dressed only in a skirt made of a fringe of yellow metro tickets. From a distance the tickets resemble bananas. The woman's hair is plastered down in a brilliantined Eton crop and her face is distorted by <b>an</b> exaggerated <b>wide</b> <b>smile.</b> The metro advertisement, framed by the caption 'Tickets Folies 2 ème Voiture le Plus Célèbre Spectacle de Paris', recalls a time in the inter-war years in Paris when Josephine Baker {{was one of the most}} celebrated 'exotic' spectacles, both on and off the music hall stage. Although Baker subsequently went on to appear in a large number of shows, re-inventing herself as a 'grande chanteuse' and although her wartime work in France's Resistance earned her the prestigious Croix de Guerre, it is this image of Baker, half-naked, dancing frenetically in a suggestively phallic girdle of bananas, which has persisted in popular cultural memory. Baker was variously figured as the modern incarnation of Baudelaire's Jeanne Duval, the 'danseuse de bananes' who brought Le Charleston and the Blackbottom to France, the 'Petite Tonkinoise', Princess Tam Tam, and theatrical grande vedette, all performed against inter-war modernism and a spectacular mise en scène of the Second French Empire which had just entered its colonial âge d'or...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Tank Ride" [...] ad from 1988 was {{an attack}} on Dukakis by the GOP. Though the ad was inaccurate, it created a lasting {{negative}} impression and helped guarantee Dukakis's defeat. The ad suggested that Bush was more supportive of military spending and weapons programs than Dukakis. The footage, pulled from the news media, showed Dukakis riding a tank {{in his attempt to}} counter the claim that he was weak on defense. He wore a large, oversized helmet and <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>smile,</b> which was used by the GOP to insinuate that he was a fool. The GOP also added gear sounds from an 18-wheeler truck to imply that Dukakis could not run the tank smoothly - although tanks do not have gears that grind.|$|E

This album shows conclusively that Slade {{are still}} capable of rocking harder and catchier than most bands half their age. They sound so lively and confident you can forgive them the rock 'n' roll clichés they occasionally slip into. As always it's the hell-raisin' metal-boogie stomps that really shake the timbers, and there's enough big stampers here to keep Quiet Riot in hits till 1987!" [...] Record Mirror said: [...] "This album is Slade's ultimate celebration, now that they've won through the bad times and apathy to be chart contenders all over again. Most of this album isn't exactly {{going to make you}} think deeply or alter the course of world history.

He would also often refer to the [...] "small, windowless booth" [...] from which he announced. Through the years, Late Nights writers gave Godard a number of bizarre backstories; for example, one typical skit involved the announcer referring to having had multiple [...] "loveless" [...] marriages and [...] "a botched mid-life circumcision," [...] as well as his [...] "ultimate sexual fantasy": a man dressed as Abraham Lincoln wearing BDSM leathers and a ball gag.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the characteristics of}} facial soft tissues at rest and <b>wide</b> <b>smile,</b> and their possible relation to the facial type. METHODS: We analyzed a sample of forty-eight young female adults, aged between 10, 19 and 40 years old, {{with a mean age}} of 30. 9 years, who had balanced profile and passive lip seal. Cone beam computed tomographies were performed at rest and <b>wide</b> <b>smile</b> postures on the entire sample which was divided into three groups according to individual facial types. Soft tissue features analysis of the lips, nose, zygoma and chin were done in sagittal, axial and frontal axis tomographic views. RESULTS: No differences were observed in any of the facial type variables for the static analysis of facial structures at both rest and <b>wide</b> <b>smile</b> postures. Dynamic analysis showed that brachifacial types are more sensitive to movement, presenting greater sagittal lip contraction. However, the lip movement produced by this type of face results in a narrow smile, with smaller tooth exposure area when compared with other facial types. CONCLUSION: Findings pointed out that the position of the upper lip should be ahead of the lower lip, and the latter, ahead of the pogonion. It was also found that the facial type does not impact the positioning of these structures. Additionally, the use of cone beam computed tomography may be a valuable method to study craniofacial features...|$|R
