25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.|$|E

In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage.

I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that.
