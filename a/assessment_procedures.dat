The procedure of LOOP delivers a 3 D-model generated from the data of a commercial in-line inspection tools (ultrasonic, magnetic flux). This {{makes it possible to}} use the full functionalities of the relevant finite element software like evaluation of wall-thinning (LOOP 1) and fracture mechanics analysis to evaluate cracks in the wall (LOOP 2). In this paper is given the basic ideas of the LOOP concept, where the main focus is directed to the LOOP 1 <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Based on a real example of a corroded pipeline is demonstrated the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is based on an elastic-plastic analysis of a real inner contour of the corroded surface transferred in the finite element geometry model. The unique element is that the surface data of the UT-pigging is used directly to generate the geometry model in the FE-software ANSYS. The <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is validated by a burst pressure test of a corroded pipeline. The result of the burst pressure test is compared with the calculated limit load from an elastic-plastic analysis based on measured material properties. Additionally, the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with the results of a limit load analysis based on DIN EN 13445 - 3 and with the results of the standard <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> At the end the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with the procedure given in API 579 - 1 standard...|$|R

40|$|Façade {{elements}} are themost vulnerable parts of buildings {{with respect to}} wind loading. In this paper it is assessed to what extent wind-loaded façade elements fulfill the minimum reliability requirements as set in the Eurocodes. The reliability analysis needed for this assessment should account for the uncertainties {{in each of the}} parameters relevant for design; both in the structural resistance part and in the wind-loading part. Additionally, the analysis needs to account for the uncertainties in the physical models as such. Until now, no generally applicable <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> exists for this purpose. By combining the knowledge of existing literature, this paper provides a generally applicable <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> that is able to determine the structural reliability of wind loaded façade elements in terms of the failure probability. The <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> uses in-situ wind speed measurements obtained from meteorological stations and location-specific pressure coefficient measurements obtained from boundary-layer wind-tunnels. Wind-directionality effects are taken into account explicitly. In order to show its potential, the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is applied on a case-study. The results show that, due to wind-directionality effects, the failure probability of the façade elements is highly dependent on the orientation of the building. Furthermore the results show that the failure probability is almost fully determined by the governing incident wind-directions only...|$|R
2500|$|Most {{aircraft}} used as air ambulances, {{with the}} exception of charter aircraft and some military aircraft, are equipped for advanced life support and have interiors that reflect this. [...] The challenges in most air ambulance operations, particularly those involving helicopters, are the high ambient noise levels and limited amounts of working space, both of which create significant issues for the provision of ongoing care. [...] While equipment tends to be high-level and very conveniently grouped, it may not be possible perform some <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as chest auscultation, while in flight.

2500|$|The {{rapid growth}} in {{diversity}} of {{school districts in the}} United States has proven that there is an increasing need for new guidelines and standards to be put into practice in able to provide nondiscriminatory <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> to students. [...] Although there is no clear-cut way to appropriately evaluate bias in the assessment of students who are culturally and linguistically diverse, the examiner must carefully consider each situation individually in order to develop an appropriate hypothesis {{that can be used in}} the testing procedure. [...] In developing a hypothesis the school psychologist must eliminate any personal or professional bias that may affect their ability to make informative decisions based on the psychometric data obtained during the assessment process. [...] Best practices prove that school psychologists who are culturally and linguistic competent are more effective in communicating to the individual or student in their native language and thus, eliminating the need for an interpreter. [...] The use of standardized testing also must be taken into account when assessing those who are of minority and lower socioeconomic status since they are so culturally loaded. [...] One must be able to recognize that the difference between the scores is not actually related to the ability or aptitude of the child, but to the incorrect interpretations that have been made based on the result of the scores and the significantly different standardized sample. [...] Another important factor in nondiscriminatory assessment is the ability for a school psychologist to recognize the difference in a bilingual assessment and how to assess bilingual individuals. [...] The apparent preference lies in using well-constructed, theoretically comprehensive, native language tests to non-native test takers rather than using limited and poor tests that are available in the test taker's native language.|$|E

40|$|The off-set <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> {{potentially}} {{contributes to}} the FIMCAR objectives to maintain the compartment strength and to assess load spreading in frontal collisions. Furthermore it provides the opportunity to assess the restraint system performance with different pulses if combined with a full-width <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> in the frontal assessment approach. Originally {{it was expected that}} the PDB <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> would be selected for the FIMCAR assessment approach. However, {{it was not possible to}} deliver a compatibility metric in time so that the current off-set procedure (ODB as used in UNECE R 94) with some minor modifications was proposed for the FIMCAR Assessment Approach. Nevertheless the potential to assess load spreading, which appears not to be possible with any other assessed frontal impact <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> was considered to be still high. Therefore the development work for the PDB <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> did not stop with the decision not to select the PDB procedure. As a result of the decisions to use the current ODB and to further develop the PDB procedure, both are covered within this deliverable. The deliverable describes the off-set test procedure that will be recommended by FIMCAR consortium, this corresponds to the ODB test as it is specified in UN-ECE Regulation 94 (R 94), i. e. EEVC deformable element with 40 % overlap at a test speed of 56 km/h. In addition to the current R 94 requirements, FIMCAR will recommend to introduce some structural requirements which will guarantee sufficiently strong occupant compartments by enforcing the stability of the forward occupant cell. With respect to the PDB <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> a new metric, Digital Derivative in Y direction - DDY, was developed, described, analysed, and compared with other metrics. The DDY metric analyses the deformation gradients laterally across the PDB face. The more even the deformation, the lower the DDY values and the better the metric’s result. In order analyse the different metrics, analysis of the existing PDB test results and the results of the performed simulation studies was performed. In addition, an assessment of artificial deformation profiles with the metrics took place. This analysis shows that there are still issues with the DDY metric but it appears that it is possible to solve them with future optimisations. For example the current metric assesses only the area within 60 % of the half vehicle width. For vehicles that have the longitudinals further outboard, the metric is not effective. In addition to the metric development, practical issues of the PDB tests such as the definition of a scan procedure for the analysis of the deformation pattern including the validation of the scanning procedure by the analysis of 3 different scans at different locations of the same barrier were addressed. Furthermore the repeatability and reproducibility of the PDB was analysed. The barrier deformation readings seem to be sensitive with respect to the impact accuracy. In total, the deliverable is meant to define the FIMCAR off-set <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> and to be a starting point for further development of the PDB <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R
