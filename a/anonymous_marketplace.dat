5000|$|Some {{internet}} forums {{such as the}} defunct Tor Carding Forum and the Russian <b>Anonymous</b> <b>Marketplace</b> {{function as}} markets with trusted members providing escrow services and users engaging in off-forum messaging. In May 2014 the [...] "Deepify" [...] service attempted to automate the process of setting up markets with a SAAS solution; however, this closed a short time later.|$|E
50|$|Some governments do not {{tolerate}} smart shops {{in any form}} {{as a part of}} their crime prevention. For example, the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden with its zero tolerance drug policy, does not accept physical smart shops and has shut down every known Swedish online smart shop that have been selling pure research chemicals on the visible Web. To circumvent this the usage of <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplaces</b> through the Tor network have taken over since the establishment of Silk Road, which in contrast took the FBI {{two and a half years}} to take down for one month.|$|R
50|$|Since most darknet markets {{run through}} Tor, {{they can be}} found with {{relative}} ease on public domains. This means that their addresses can be found, as well as customer reviews and open forums pertaining to the drugs being sold on the market, all without incriminating any form of user. This kind of anonymity enables users {{on both sides of}} dark markets to escape the reaches of law enforcement. The result is that law enforcement adheres to a campaign of singling out individual markets and drug dealers to cut down supply. However, dealers and suppliers are able to stay one step ahead of law enforcement, who cannot keep up with the rapidly expanding and <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplaces</b> of dark markets.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{to which}} degree one could trace Bitcoin transactions and characterize purchasing behavior of online <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplaces</b> by exploiting side channels. Using {{a list of}} addresses found by the FBI on Silk Road servers, and information on the marketplace 2 ̆ 7 s official guides, we infer {{the role played by}} each address in the list and classify them based on heuristics. We then attempt to trace Bitcoin transactions and show that the anonymity set size is greatly reduced using product review data and the address classification performed on the previous step. Finally, using clustering techniques based on transaction graph analysis, we assign addresses into user wallets, then group these wallets together based on spending patterns, to be able to characterize purchasing behavior...|$|R
50|$|Sheep Marketplace was an <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> {{set up as}} a Tor hidden service. It {{launched}} in March 2013 {{and was one of}} the lesser known sites to gain popularity with the well publicized closure of the Silk Road marketplace later that year. It ceased operation in December 2013, when it announced it was shutting down after a vendor stole $6 million worth of users' bitcoins.|$|E
40|$|February 2011 saw the {{emergence}} of Silk Road, the first successful online <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace,</b> in which buy-ers and sellers could transact with anonymity properties far superior to those available in alternative online or of-fline means of commerce. Business on Silk Road, pri-marily involving narcotics trafficking, rapidly boomed, and competitors emerged. At the same time, law enforce-ment did not sit idle, and eventually managed to shut down Silk Road in October 2013 and arrest its operator. Far from causing the demise of this novel form of com-merce, the Silk Road take-down spawned an entire, dy-namic, online <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> ecosystem, which has continued to evolve to this day. This paper presents a long-term measurement analysis of {{a large portion of}} this online <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> ecosystem, including 16 different marketplaces, over more than two years (2013 – 2015). By using long-term measurements, and combin-ing our own data collection with publicly available pre-vious efforts, we offer a detailed understanding of the growth of the online <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> ecosystem. We are able to document the evolution of the types of goods being sold, and assess the effect (or lack thereof) of adversarial events, such as law enforcement operations or large-scale frauds, on the overall size of the economy. We also provide insights into how vendors are diversi-fying and replicating across marketplaces, and how ven-dor security practices (e. g., PGP adoption) are evolving. These different aspects help us understand how tradi-tional, physical-world criminal activities are developing an online presence, in the same manner traditional com-merce diversified online in the 1990 s. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{economics}} of buying and selling audiences in the television advertising market by examining selected characteristics of the market information system. Neoclassical economic theory often assumes an <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> in which information is perfect and readily available to all trading partners. Based on interviews with market participants, I argue that these assumptions do not hold in the real world. Buyers and sellers of advertising are aware that their identities influence trade opportunities: Dishonest business dealings today will affect tomorrow's prospects. They develop personal networks that ensure access to credible information. ...|$|E
40|$|Cryptomarkets – online, <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplaces</b> for illicit {{goods and}} {{services}} that mostly specialise in drugs – account for a small but rapidly growing share of the illicit drug market in many countries. Policy responses so far are generally {{based on the assumption}} that their rise will only increase drug harms. In this contribution for debate, we question this assumption. We use existing theory on the effects of drug markets on various forms of harm, alongside emerging evidence on the operation of cryptomarkets, to assess anticipated harms and benefits. We suggest it is likely that cryptomarkets will increase both the amount and the range of substances that are sold. But we argue that the effects on harms will depend on whether cryptomarkets also increase the quality and safety of products that are sold, provide information to consumers that they can use to reduce the level of harm for each unit of consumption, and reduce transactional conflict involved in drug purchasing...|$|R
40|$|The Australia 21 report argues the “war on drugs” {{has failed}} {{and we should}} {{consider}} other options for controlling drugs, such as decriminalisation or regulation. In addition to these arguments, an important challenge for drug prohibition has been overlooked in the drugs debate so far: the internet. While the internet has opened up new opportunities to buy drugs, it has also accelerated new drug trends. In the past year, we’ve seen the emergence of two key trends: synthetic cannabinoids (sold as Kronic, K 2, Spice, among other names) and the <b>anonymous</b> online <b>marketplace</b> Silk Road...|$|R
40|$|Cryptomarkets are online marketplaces {{that are}} part of the Dark Web and mainly devoted to the sale of illicit drugs. They combine tools to ensure {{anonymity}} of participants with the delivery of products by mail to enable the development of illicit drug trafficking. Using data collected on eight cryptomarkets, this study provides an overview of the Canadian illicit drug market. It seeks to inform about the most prevalent illicit drugs vendors offer for sale and preferred destination countries. Moreover, the research gives an insight into the structure and organisation of distribution networks existing online. In particular, we provide information about how vendors are diversifying and replicating across marketplaces. We inform on the number of listings each vendor manages, the number of cryptomarkets they are active on and the products they offer. This research demonstrates the importance of online marketplaces in the context of illicit drug trafficking. It shows how the analysis of data available online may elicit knowledge on criminal activities. Such knowledge is mandatory to design efficient policy for monitoring or repressive purposes against <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> Nevertheless, trafficking on Dark Net markets is difficult to analyse based only on digital data. A more holistic approach for investigating this crime problem should be developed. This should rely on a combined use and interpretation of digital and physical data within a single collaborative intelligence model...|$|R
40|$|The author {{declares}} {{there is}} no conflict of interest. Author’s preprint. Not for redistribution. Barratt et al. ’s article presents the first large survey to characterize buyers on the online <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> Silk Road. At the time the survey was conducted, Silk Road was the most successful online drug marketplace. While people had been exchanging drugs online through forums, bulletin boards, and even dedicated websites for years, thanks to an ingenious combination of cryptographic tools, Silk Road offered stronger anonymity to its sellers and buyers, and facilitated the online trade of drugs on an unprecedented scale. A {{few months after the}} study was completed, Silk Road was taken down following a lengthy FBI operation. The billion-dollar amounts alleged in the criminal complaint (1) (and unfortunately echoed in Barratt et al. ’s paper) are highly inflated due to erroneous conversion rates between “bitcoins ” and US dollars, but it remains true that Silk Road was a thriving marketplace (2). More interestingly, the criminal complaint suggests that most of the operation revolved around traditional police techniques, such as infiltratio...|$|E
40|$|This work {{introduces}} a decentralized <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace.</b> We study {{the nature of}} such marketplaces, and we present our implementation of a practical such marketplace which we call OpenBazaar. We then focus our study on the security and trust aspect of such a marketplace. We explore the security implications of decentralization and anonymity, and propose several mechanisms to achieve trust. Our proposals include traditional secure software development mechanisms, which we have applied in practice in our implementation. We also propose {{the use of an}} anonymity-preserving transport layer. More importantly, we explore how cryptocurrency mechanisms can be used to achieve trust without the need of central third parties, through the particular mechanisms of arbitration, multisigs, and mutually assured destruction. The cryptographic and game theoretic properties of such schemes are explored, and an implementation using bitcoin is studied. We also propose novel attacks on these schemes. Our contribution includes several mechanisms of achieving trust. We introduce a new form of web-of-trust in which multiplicative rules are used for trust transitivity, while decentralization, security, and anonymity are preserved. We explore the anonymity and security properties of such webs-of-trust and discuss separation attacks. Our contribution also includes the use of proof-of-burn mechanisms to build identities, for which we provide an implementation. Finally, we also contribute with anonymous decentralized naming of stores, for which we also provide an implementation using Namecoin...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Internet has been {{established}} as a place for drug markets to expand into a new reality and develop according to new business opportunities. Silk Road {{is one of many}} cryptomarkets that have succeeded online, offering a wide selection of drugs on global level. This thesis deals with the structural aspect of Silk Road and how it is organized, with theories of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari as a theoretical perspective to catch the complexity. Data has been collected through observations of Silk Road 2. 0, the second edition of the Silk Road market concept. More than a thousand screen shots have been captured and hundreds of pages with forum conversations printed to give a complete understanding of the market structure. The online environment has made huge changes in the structure of drug markets, where new opportunities have been offered and restrictions created. As a facilitator of communication without hardly any spatial or timely limits, the Internet has become a place to establish connections around the world. Cryptomarkets are deriving advantages from this new context and have established themselves as a meeting point for entrepreneurs, consumers, and other people wanting drug related information. Markets such as Silk Road are offering an <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplace</b> and forum where people can stay without being connected to their physical self. This might lead to a more socially equal market, but one cannot ignore existence of online restrictions and risks. The lack of face-to-face contact challenges Silk Road when it comes to trust and security – how can anything be secure when the participants are unidentifiable? Silk Road solves this insecurity by introducing a feedback system and encouraging social interaction to increase the trust level. Leaving feedback has left the consumers with a major power to affect the market; bad comments and rumors are hurtful for the vendors, who in return offer the buyers great customer service to avoid negative feedback. Silk Road s forum is also important because of how the vivid interaction leads to a closer community bond that heightens the level of trust. The closeness among the participants is also increased by similar motivations and goals, which steers the market in a specific direction following the participants lead. But it is still the administrator that enforces rules and delegates roles. Silk Road might seem as a free market, but after a closer look one discovers restrictions and formal boundaries. The restrictions, though, are not involuntarily enforced, but rather desired by the participants {{in order to keep the}} market more stable. Morally decisions such as banning the sale of weapons are taken collectively and forum hierarchies are revealing the level of experience – all to induce trust into the market. Additionally, formal rules are an attempt of creating order, which does increase the trust, but it also seems to leave the participants with a false security. Role divisions are not as formal as they might seem, especially since all the participants can interact in multiple activities crisscrossing their appointed tasks. This is where Deleuze and Guattari s rhizome theory becomes particularly useful. According to their theory, social structures are based on a multitude of connecting nodes and other unnatural attempts to create order. Silk Road s rules and role divisions are accepted as organizing elements in the market, but it is also important to look beyond them to see the chaos that really exists. Nothing is as simple as ordering structures such as binary opposites and hierarchical structures; they need to be placed in a larger rhizomatic structure to see the many connections. Also, this opens up for acceptance of elements from the general society as important influences on Silk Road s structure. Cryptomarkets would not exist without the development of networked technologies and constraints set by law enforcement agencies. Media also has an impact on creating the cryptomarket reality adding to the participants experience and influence on the market structure. Silk Road is also tightly connected to the physical world through drug supplies and postal services. The structure of Silk Road is a complex rhizome, where elements of hierarchical settings and role divisions are important for its totality. But so is also the interplay between different connections both inside and outside the online market. Silk Road is a place for entrepreneurs to enter a structured environment and act as a collective group, while still keeping their individuality. Therefore, the complex structure of Silk Road resembles a controlled entrepreneurial market, where chaos and multiplicity lingers under the seemingly formal structure...|$|E
40|$|Presented on August 26, 2016 at 12 : 00 p. m. in the Klaus Computing Building, Room 1116 W. Nicolas Christin is an Associate Research Professor in the School of Computer Science and in Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. He is {{affiliated}} with the Institute for Software Research, and is a core faculty member of CyLab, the university-wide security institute. His research interests are in computer and information systems networks; most of his work is at the boundary of systems and policy research, with a slant toward security aspects. He has most recently focused on online crime, security economics, and psychological aspects of computer security. Runtime: 55 : 26 minutesIn this talk, I will argue that understanding incentives of both attackers and targets has become critical to strengthening online security. I will advocate {{the need for an}} interdisciplinary research agenda, ranging from network measurements and large-scale data analysis to human factor modeling. Using case studies (online sale of unlicensed pharmaceutical drugs, and <b>anonymous</b> <b>marketplaces),</b> I will first describe how longitudinal, large-scale measurements and data analysis reveal important economic and structural properties of a priori complex criminal ecosystems. I will then discuss how these structural properties can be used to design successful interventions, both from a policy and from a technical angle. On the policy side, I will show that our criminal ecosystem analysis evidences "concentration points," whose disruption could effectively hamper illicit operations. On the technical side, I will demonstrate how we can use adversaries' incentives to design and build systems that can proactively identify future attack targets. I will conclude by outlining a roadmap for security research combining measurements, mathematical modeling and behavioral aspects...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, online person-to-person lending, also called {{peer-to-peer}} or P 2 P lending, {{emerged as an}} alternative form of consumer borrowing and investing. It grew throughout the recession, even as consumer credit markets faltered, {{and it continues to}} grow today. P 2 P lending platforms match individuals looking to borrow with individuals looking to lend in <b>anonymous</b> online <b>marketplaces.</b> They offer attractive interest rates, debt consolidation, access to liquidity, and inexpensive diversification. Despite its growth, however, the P 2 P lending market faces significant challenges. In 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) declared that notes issued by P 2 P lending platforms to be unregistered securities. This forced the platforms-as web startups-to register for initial public offerings. SEC regulation now creates substantial compliance costs, barriers to entry, and risks to consumers in the P 2 P lending market. P 2 P lending should therefore be exempted from SEC regulation and placed under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2 ̆ 2 CFPB 2 ̆ 7) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comprehensive}} measurement analysis of Silk Road, an <b>anonymous,</b> international online <b>marketplace</b> that {{operates as a}} Tor hidden service and uses Bitcoin as its exchange currency. We gather and analyze data over eight months {{between the end of}} 2011 and 2012, including daily crawls of the marketplace for nearly six months in 2012. We obtain a detailed picture of the type of goods being sold on Silk Road, and of the revenues made both by sellers and Silk Road operators. Through examining over 24, 400 separate items sold on the site, we show that Silk Road is overwhelmingly used as a market for controlled substances and narcotics, and that most items sold are available for less than three weeks. The majority of sellers disappears within roughly three months of their arrival, but a core of 112 sellers has been present throughout our measurement interval. We evaluate the total revenue made by all sellers, from public listings, to slightly over USD 1. 2 million per month; this corresponds to about USD 92, 000 per month in commissions for the Silk Road operators. We further show that the marketplace has been operating steadily, with daily sales and number of sellers overall increasing over our measurement interval. We discuss economic and policy implications of our analysis and results, including ethical considerations for future research in this area.
