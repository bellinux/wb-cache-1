40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} post-op cone beam CT (CBCT) of 8 adult patients and 14 fresh temporal bones that underwent cochlear implantation with straight flexible electrodes array {{was performed to}} determine if the position of a long and flexible electrodes array within the cochlear scalae could be reliably assessed with CBCT. An oto-radiologist and two otologists examined the images and assessed the electrodes position. The temporal bone specimens underwent histological analysis for confirm the exact position. The position of the electrodes was rated as scala tympani, scala vestibule, or intermediate position for the electrodes at 180 °, 360 ° and for the <b>apical</b> <b>electrode.</b> In the patient group, for the electrodes at 180 ° all observers agreed for scala tympani position except for 1 evaluation, while a discrepancy in 3 patients both for the 360 ° and for the <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> assessment were found. In five temporal bones the evaluations were in discrepancy for the 180 ° electrode, while at 360 ° a disagreement between raters on the scalar positioning was seen in six temporal bones. A higher discrepancy between was found in assessment of the scalar position of the <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> (average pairwise agreement 45. 4 %, Fleiss k = 0. 13). A good concordance was found between the histological results and the consensus between raters for the electrodes in the basal turn, while low agreement (Cohen's k 0. 31, pairwise agreement 50 %) was found in the identification of the <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> position confirming the difficulty to correct identify the electrode position in the second cochlear turn in temporal bones. In conclusion, CBCT is a reliable radiologic exam to correctly evaluate the position of a lateral wall flexible array in implanted patients using the proposed imaging reconstruction method, while some artefacts impede exact evaluation of the position of the <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> in temporal bone and other radiological techniques should be preferred in ex vivo studies...|$|E

40|$|Neurophysiological {{studies in}} {{animals and humans}} suggest that severe hearing loss during early {{development}} impairs the maturation of the auditory brainstem. To date, studies in humans have mainly focused on the neural activation of the auditory brainstem in children treated with a cochlear implant (CI), but {{little is known about}} the pattern of activation in adult CI users with early onset of deafness (prelingual, before the age of 2 years). In this study, we compare auditory brainstem activation in prelingually deaf and late-implanted adult CI users to that in postlingually deaf CI users. Electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (eABRs) were recorded by monopolar stimulation, separately using a middle and an <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> of the CI. Comparison of the eABR latencies revealed that wave V was significantly delayed in the prelingually deaf CI users on both electrode locations. Accordingly, when the <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> was stimulated, the III-V interwave interval was significantly longer in the prelingually deaf group. These findings suggest a slower neural conduction in the auditory brainstem, probably caused by impairment of maturation during the long duration of severe hearing loss in infancy. Shorter wave V latencies, reflecting a more mature brainstem, appeared to be a predictor for better speech perception...|$|E
40|$|Using long Med-El Combi 40 + {{electrode}} arrays, it is {{now possible}} to cover the whole range of the cochlea, up to about two turns. Such insertion depths have received little attention. To evaluate the contribution of deeply inserted electrodes, five Med-El cochlear implant users were tested on vowel and consonant identification tests with fittings with first one, two, and up to five <b>apical</b> <b>electrodes</b> being deactivated. In addition, subjects performed pitch-ranking experiments, using loudness-balanced stimuli, to identify electrodes creating pitch confusions. Radiographs were taken to measure each electrode insertion depth. All subjects used each modified fitting for two periods of about 3  weeks. During the experiment, the same stimulation rate and frequency range were maintained across all the fittings used for each individual subject. After each trial period the subject had to perform three consonant and three vowel identification tests. All subjects showed deep electrode insertions ranging from 605 ° to 720 °. The two subjects with the deepest electrode insertions showed significantly increased vowel- and consonant-identification performances with fittings with the two or three most <b>apical</b> <b>electrodes</b> deactivated compared to their standard fitting with all available electrodes activated.

Four out of five subjects preferred to continue use of a fitting with one or more <b>apical</b> <b>electrodes</b> deactivated. The two subjects with the deepest insertions also showed pitch confusions between their most <b>apical</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Two possible reasons for these results are discussed.

Each stimulus was a pulse train delivered on either a single electrode or multiple electrodes sequentially. Four spatial stimulation patterns were used: a single <b>apical</b> <b>electrode,</b> a single mid electrode, a pair of electrodes (apical and mid), and 11 electrodes (from apical to mid). Within one block of trials, all stimuli had the same spatial stimulation pattern, with pulse rate varying from 131 to 262 [*]pps.

To improve binaural hearing in bilaterally implanted cochlear implant (BiCI) users, a coding strategy providing the best possible access to IPDs is highly desirable. Outcomes of a previous study (Zirn, Arndt et al. 2016) revealed that a subset of BiCI users showed improved IPD detection thresholds with the fine structure processing strategy FS 4 compared to the constant rate strategy HDCIS using narrowband stimuli. In contrast, little differences between the coding strategies were found for broadband stimuli with regard to binaural speech intelligibility level differences (BILD) as an estimate of binaural unmasking. Compared to normalhearing listeners (7. 5 ± 1. 2 dB) BILD were small in BiCI users (around 0. 5 dB with both coding strategies). In the present work, we investigated the influence of binaural fitting parameters on BILD. In our cohort of BiCI users many were implanted with electrode arrays differing in length left versus right.

Objective. To test the effect of modiolar placement of a cochlear implant on stimulation thresholds, and to confirm whether peri-modiolar electrode placement resulted in the hypothesized reduced spread of excitation.

40|$|Current {{cochlear}} implant stimulation strategies are widely {{based on the}} continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) paradigm.

However, fine structure information is a crucial ingredient for the perception of music and of tonal languages, as demonstrated in studies with normal hearing subjects. In the fine structure strategy presented, “channel specific sampling sequences” (CSSS) or pulse-packages are applied to the <b>apical</b> <b>electrodes,</b> while the remaining basal electrodes carry CIS-like stimuli. The pulse sequences are triggered by the zero-crossings of the corresponding filter channel outputs and scaled with the channel envelopes.

For the Advanced Bionics and MedEl users the pulses were triphasic {{and consisted of}} a 32 -μs central phase flanked by two 32 -μs phases of opposite polarity and half the amplitude. The central phase was either anodic (TP-A) or cathodic (TP-C). For the Cochlear Corp. users, pulses consisted of two 32 -μs phases of the same polarity separated by an 8 -μs gap, flanked by two 32 -μs phases of the opposite polarity, each of which was separated from the central portion by a 58 -μs gap. The central portion of these quadraphasic pulses was either anodic (QP-A) or cathodic (QP-C), and all phases had the same amplitude.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Chronic {{stimulation}} of the right ventricle with pacemaker is associated with ventricular dyssynchrony and loss of contractility, even in subjects without previous dysfunction. In these patients, there is a debate of which pacing site is less associated with loss of ventricular function. Objective: To compare pacemaker-induced dyssynchrony among different pacing sites in right ventricular stimulation. Methods: Cross-sectional study of outpatients with right ventricle stimulation higher than 80 % and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Pacing lead position (apical, medial septum or free wall) was assessed through chest X-rays. Every patient underwent echocardiogram to evaluate for dyssynchrony according to CARE-HF criteria: aortic pre-ejection time, interventricular delay and septum/posterior wall delay on M mode. Results: Forty patients were included. Fifty-two percent had <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> position, 42 % mid septum and 6 % free wall. Mean QRS time 148. 97 ± 15. 52 milliseconds. A weak correlation between the mean QRS width and pre-aortic ejection time (r= 0. 32; P= 0. 04) was found. No difference in QRS width among the positions could be noted. Intraventricular delay was lower in apical patients against mid septal (34. 4 ± 17. 2 vs. 54. 3 ± 19. 1 P< 0. 05) - no difference with those electrode on the free wall. No difference was noted in the pre-aortic ejection time (P= 0. 9). Conclusion: Apical pacing showed a lower interventricular conduction delay when compared to medial septum site. Our findings suggest that apical pacing dyssynchrony is not ubiquitous, as previously thought, and that it should remain an option for lead placement...|$|E

There was no difference found between strategies across research subjects for consonant, vowel, CVC words and sentences-in-noise tests. However, there were significant individual subject differences confirming that there is still a case for considering low-rate stimulation when Mapping patients. The DRSP strategy demonstrated a compromise between the fixed low-rate and high-rate strategies that can perform equal to or better than either of these strategies for most subjects. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) can be used to predict psychophysical electrical-field interaction patterns obtained with simultaneous stimulation of intracochlear electrodes. The second goal was to determine whether ECAP patterns are affected by recording location because differences might influence the relation between ECAP and psychophysical measures. The third goal was to investigate whether symmetrical threshold shifts are produced with phase inversion of the interaction stimulus. Nine adults with Advanced Bionics cochlear implants participated. ECAP and psychophysical thresholds were obtained for basal, middle, and <b>apical</b> probe <b>electrodes</b> in the presence of a subthreshold interaction stimulus delivered simultaneously to each of seven to eight interaction electrodes per probe. The results showed highly significant correlations between ECAP and psychophysical threshold shifts for all nine subjects, which suggests that the ECAP can adequately predict psychophysical electrical-field interaction patterns for subthreshold stimuli. ECAP thresholds were significantly higher for recordings from the basal (versus apical) side of the probe, which suggests that recording location may affect relations between ECAP and psychophysical measures. Interaction stimulus phase inversion generally produced symmetrical threshold shifts for psychophysical measures but not for half of ECAP measures...|$|R
40|$|Electrode-pitch rankings and {{monaural}} and binau-ral speech perception {{scores were}} obtained from two patients fit with a Med El CIS-Link processor and Ineraid electrode array in one ear and a Clarion processor and Hi-Focus electrode array in the other ear. The results of the electrode-ranking task indi-cated that current from the Hi-Focus electrodes extended more apically than current from the In-eraid array, i. e., the two most apical Hi-Focus elec-trodes were ranked lower in pitch than the most <b>apical</b> Ineraid <b>electrode.</b> Because of this and be-cause of the different number of active electrodes in the two arrays, {{it is likely that}} the two cochleae presented different representations of the same sig-nal to more central stages of information process-ing. In spite of this, both patients achieved better scores when both implants were activated than when the implants were activated one at a time. (Ear & Hearing 2004; 25; 191 – 194) Binaural cochlear implants are likely to provide better speech understanding than a monaural im-plant in two conditions: (i) when the electrodes in the two ears are inserted to the same depth and, as a consequence, the outputs of the two auditory peripheries are frequency matched, or (ii) when the electrodes in the two ears are inserted to different depths and the information from the two electrode arrays is complementary (Lawson, Wolford, Brill...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} investigated the effects of asymmetric current waveforms on the perception of place and temporal pitch cues. The asymmetric waveforms were trains of pseudomonophasic (PS) pulses consisting of a short, high-amplitude phase followed by a longer (and lower amplitude) opposite-polarity phase. When such pulses were presented in a narrow bipolar (“BP+ 1 ”) mode and with the first phase anodic relative to the most <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> (so-called PSA pulses), pitch was lower than when the first phase was anodic re the more basal electrode. For a pulse rate of 12 pulses per second (pps), pitch was also lower than with standard symmetric biphasic pulses in either monopolar or bipolar mode. This suggests that PSA pulses can extend the range of place-pitch percepts available to cochlear implant listeners by focusing the spread of excitation in a more apical region than common stimulation techniques. Temporal pitch was studied by requiring subjects to pitch-rank single-channel pulse trains with rates ranging from 105 to 1, 156  pps; this task was repeated at several intra-cochlear stimulation sites and using both symmetric and pseudomonophasic pulses. For PSA pulses presented to apical electrodes, the upper limit of temporal pitch {{was significantly higher than}} that for all the other conditions, averaging 713  pps. Measures of discriminability obtained using the method of constant stimuli indicated that this pitch percept was probably weak. However, a multidimensional scaling study showed that the percept associated with a rate change, even at high rates, was orthogonal to that of a place change and therefore reflected a genuine change in the temporal pattern of neural activity...|$|E

Any queries to umer-enquiries@unimelb. edu. auThe {{study has}} aimed at determining whether {{the ability to}} use place coded vowel formant information could be enhanced with analytical vowel training in a group of -congenitally deafened patients, who showed limited speech perception skills after cochlear implant experience ranging from 1 y 8 m to 6 y 11 m. It has investigated whether improvements in vowel perception after training can carry over to word recognition. A further objective was to see whether poorer vowel perception was associated with poorer electrode position difference limens. Three children, one adolescent and one young adult were assessed with synthesized versions of the words /hid, head, had, hud, hod, hood/ and a natural version of these words as well as with a closed-set monosyllabic word task. The change in performance after 10 training sessions was compared to the change in performance during a non-training period. Four of the five patients showed a significant gain in synthetic vowel perception post-training on at least one assessment, but only two patients showed gains across a number of tests post-training. For one of these 2 children improvements in vowel perception generalized to word perception. Patients’ electrode limens ranged from 1 to 3 electrodes except for 1 adolescent whose minimal progress post-training could be partly explained by poorer <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> discrimination. The findings are discussed with reference to a number of factors, including the notion of a "critical period" for neural plasticity. 2 - 7 MarchRestricted Access: This resource is not available from the Digital Repository for permission reasons.

40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Ear and Hearing 1997. This version is reproduced with permission of Lippincott Wilkins & Williams. Objective: The aim was to determine whether the ability to use place-coded vowel formant information could be improved after training in a group of congenitally deafened patients, who showed limited speech perception ability after cochlear implant use ranging from 1 yr 8 mo to 6 yr 11 mo. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between electrode position difference limens and vowel recognition. Design: Three children, one adolescent, and one young adult were assessed with synthesized versions of the words /hid, head, had, hud, hod, hood/ containing three formants and with a natural version of these words as well as with a 12 -alternative, closed-set task containing monosyllabic words. The change in performance during a nontraining period was compared to the change in performance after 10 training sessions. Results: After training, two children showed significant gains on a number of tests and improvements were consistent with their electrode discrimination ability. Difference limens ranged from one to three electrodes for these patients as well as for two other patients who showed minimal to no improvements. The minimal gains shown by the final patient could be partly explained by poorer <b>apical</b> <b>electrode</b> position difference limen. Conclusions: Significant gains in vowel perception occurred post-training on several assessments for two of the children. This suggests the need for children to continue to have aural rehabilitation for a substantial period after implantation. Minimal improvements, however, occurred for the remaining patients. With the exception of one patient, their poorer performance was not associated with poorer electrode discrimination. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{residual}} acoustic hearing supplements cochlear implant function to improve speech recognition in noise as well as perception of music. The current study had two primary objectives. First, we sought to determine how cochlear implantation and electrical stimulation over a time period of 14 to 21  months influence cochlear structures such as hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Second, we sought to investigate whether the structures that provide acoustic hearing also affect the perception of electrical stimulation. We compared psychophysical responses to cochlear implant stimulation in two groups of adult guinea pigs. Group I (11 animals) received a cochlear implant in a previously untreated ear, while group II (ten animals) received a cochlear implant in an ear that had been previously infused with neomycin to destroy hearing. Psychophysical thresholds were measured in response to pulse-train and sinusoidal stimuli. Histological analysis of all group I animals and a subset of group II animals was performed. Nine of the 11 group I animals showed survival of the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion neurons adjacent to the electrode array. All group I animals showed survival of these elements in regions <b>apical</b> to the <b>electrode</b> array. Group II animals that were examined histologically showed complete loss of the organ of Corti in regions adjacent and <b>apical</b> to the <b>electrode</b> array and severe spiral ganglion neuron loss, consistent with previous reports for neomycin-treated ears. Behaviorally, group II animals had significantly lower thresholds than group I animals in response to 100  Hz sinusoidal stimuli. However, group I animals had significantly lower thresholds than group II animals in response to pulse-train stimuli (0. 02  ms/phase; 156 to 5, 000  pps). Additionally, the two groups showed distinct threshold versus pulse rate functions. We hypothesize that the differences in detection thresholds between groups are caused by the electrical activation of the hair cells in group I animals and/or differences between groups in the condition of the spiral ganglion neurons...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that a main {{limitation}} of the cochlear implant is the spread of current induced by each electrode, which activates an inappropriately large range of sensory neurons. To reduce this spread, an alternative stimulation mode, the all-polar mode, was tested with five participants. It was designed to activate all the electrodes simultaneously with appropriate current levels and polarities to recruit narrower regions of auditory nerves at specific intracochlear electrode positions (denoted all-polar electrodes). In this study, the all-polar mode was compared with the current commercial stimulation mode: the monopolar mode. The participants were asked to judge the sound dissimilarity between pairs of two-electrode pulse-train stimuli that differed in the electrode positions and were presented in either monopolar or all-polar mode with pulses on the two electrodes presented either sequentially or simultaneously. The dissimilarity ratings were analyzed using a multidimensional scaling technique and three-dimensional stimulus perceptual spaces were produced. For all the conditions (mode and simultaneity), the first perceptual dimension was highly correlated with the position of the most <b>apical</b> activated <b>electrode</b> of the electrical stimulation and the second dimension with the position of the most basal electrode. In both sequential and simultaneous conditions, the monopolar and all-polar stimuli were significantly separated by a third dimension, which may indicate that all-polar stimuli have a perceptual quality that differs from monopolar stimuli. Overall, the results suggest that both modes might successfully represent spectral information in a sound processing strategy...|$|R
