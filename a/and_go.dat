5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog could escape from a ship <b>and</b> <b>go</b> on a killing spree.

Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system <b>and</b> <b>go</b> on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
