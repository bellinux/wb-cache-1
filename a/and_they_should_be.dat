Normally, three gyroscopes are required for operation; observations are still possible with two, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult. There are further contingency plans for observations with just one gyro, but if all gyros fail, continued scientific observations will not be possible. In 2005, {{it was decided to}} switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable. One more gyro failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyros were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three gyros were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> much more reliable.|$|E

An inscription of the Nagarakhanda Kadambas, a later descendent dynasty, gives a legendary account and traces their lineage back to the Nandas.

The U.S. Congress meanwhile passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the United Province of Canada), which, {{as part of the}} British Empire, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.|$|E

By March 2009, Tribune was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and lawyers for the company began to declare their ownership of television and film rights to Dick Tracy.

Former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington was appointed as his successor two days later, with Fred Barber joining from Bury as his assistant. Mills' remaining coaching staff of Darron Gee, Des Lyttle and Paul Musselwhite left the club. Following his appointment, Worthington indicated the players out on loan would return to the club, saying, [...] "It's only right that contracted players should be in and around the club over the next 10 matches as York City are paying their salaries <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> part of anything that is going on in the next two months".

500|$|Antibiotics {{tend to be}} {{extensively}} {{used for}} emergency dental problems. As samples for microbiologic culture and sensitivity are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin are typically used for a short course of about three to seven days. Antibiotics {{are seen as a}} [...] "quick fix" [...] by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies, and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments (such as tooth extraction) which are perceived negatively. However, antibiotics typically only temporarily suppress an infection, and the need for definitive treatment is only postponed for an unpredictable length of time. An estimated 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, a major factor in antibiotic resistance. They are often used inappropriately, in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis, apical abscess, dry socket, or mild pericoronitis. However, the reality is that antibiotics are rarely needed, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used restrictively in dentistry. Local measures such as incision and drainage, and removal of the cause of the infection (such as a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important. If abscess drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} of Homicide drew several {{comparisons}} to NYPD Blue, an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received {{a large amount}} of publicity and better ratings than Homicide, which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like Homicide, NYPD Blue featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support Homicide. Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to NYPD Blue because Homicide debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described NYPD Blue as [...] "the television version of Homicide". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: [...] "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [...] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, NYPD Blue, because it's the knockoff of Homicide." [...] NYPD Blue co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish Homicide the best [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> so lucky as to do as well as we're doing right now." ...|$|E
