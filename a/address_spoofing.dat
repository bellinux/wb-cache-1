25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them. The incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively {{makes it impossible to}} stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP <b>address</b> <b>spoofing)</b> also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.|$|E

2500|$|As stated above, the ETSI {{architecture}} is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI (or CD) {{is dependent on}} parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. [...] For example, {{in the case of}} email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message). [...] Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email <b>address</b> <b>spoofing</b> that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address). [...] Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.|$|E
25|$|NTP {{has been}} used in {{distributed}} denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A small query is sent to an NTP server with the return <b>address</b> <b>spoofed</b> to be the target address. Similar to the DNS amplification attack, the server responds with a much larger reply that allows an attacker to substantially increase the amount of data being sent to the target. To avoid participating in an attack, servers can be configured to ignore external queries, or they can be upgraded to version 4.2.7p26 or later.|$|R

2500|$|In March 2013, CyberBunker, an {{internet}} provider named after its former headquarters in a surplus NATO bunker in the Netherlands that [...] "offers anonymous hosting of anything except child porn and anything related to terrorism" [...] {{was added to}} the Spamhaus blacklist used by email providers to weed out spam. Shortly afterwards, beginning on March 18, Spamhaus was the target of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack exploiting a long-known vulnerability in the Domain Name System (DNS) which permits origination of massive quantities of messages at devices owned by others using IP <b>address</b> <b>spoofing.</b> Devices exploited in the attack may be as simple as a cable converter box connected to the internet. The attack was of a previously unreported scale (peaking at 300 gigabits per second; an average large-scale attack might reach 50 Gbit/s, and the largest previous publicly reported attack was 100 Gbit/s) was launched against Spamhaus's DNS servers; [...] the effects of the attack had lasted for over a week. Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, said that they had withstood the attack, using the assistance of other internet companies such as Google to absorb the excess traffic. Linford also claimed that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world, who had chosen to remain anonymous to avoid similar attacks on their own infrastructure. Spamhaus also hired Cloudflare, a DDoS mitigation company, to assist them by distributing their internet services across Cloudflare's worldwide network, after which the focus of the attack was redirected to the companies that provide Cloudflare's network connections.|$|E

25|$|Clone {{phishing}} {{is a type}} of {{phishing attack}} whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email.

It may claim to be a resend of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.|$|R

Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicates an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs), sent with forged IP source <b>addresses</b> (<b>spoofing).</b> TCP has always been susceptible to such RST spoofing attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via the obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers.

40|$|Abstract. Forging IP source <b>addresses</b> (<b>spoofing)</b> is {{a common}} {{technique}} to conceal the origin of a network level attack in todayâ€™s best effort IP networks. In the future, IP spoofing may also directly interfere with service agreements used in quality of service (QoS) enabled IP networks because policing mechanisms located in the core cannot distinguish between malicious and benevolent packets. This reduces the reliability of real-time data delivery services offered by future multiservice networks. However, without true origin authentication at the network layer, usually access networks only can detect IP spoofing reliably, by using additional trust-by-wire information. We extend this concept to the core network by proposing a mechanism that prevents packets that have been spoofed from entering reserved paths. This reduces the probability of successful DoS attacks on guaranteed QoS in IP networks, and is a good protective measure applicable for critical IP network infrastructures...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for biometric systems to be manipulated through {{some form of}} subversion is well acknowledged. One such ap-proach known as spoofing relates to the provocation of false accepts in authentication applications. Another approach re-ferred to as obfuscation relates to the provocation of missed detections in surveillance applications. While the automatic speaker verification research community is now <b>addressing</b> <b>spoofing</b> and countermeasures, vulnerabilities to obfuscation remain largely unknown. This paper reports the first study. Our work with standard NIST datasets and protocols shows that the equal error rate of a standard GMM-UBM system is increased from 9 % to 48 % through obfuscation, whereas that of a state-of-the-art i-vector system increases from 3 % to 20 %. We also present a generalised approach to obfuscation detection which succeeds in detecting almost all attempts to evade detection.
