50|$|Normally, {{under the}} <b>equalization</b> scheme, <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> go down {{for every dollar}} {{increase}} in a province's ability to raise taxes. So, for example, if a province's economy booms and the provincial government's potential income tax revenues increase, <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> decrease. Economist Michael Smart has argued that this gives have-not provinces an incentive to raise taxes, because any harm higher taxes do to the economy is off-set by higher <b>equalization</b> <b>payments.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, {{the federal}} {{government}} makes <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> to less wealthy Canadian provinces to equalize the provinces' [...] "fiscal capacity" [...] - their ability to generate tax revenues. A province that does not receive <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "have province", while one that does is called a [...] "have not province".

5000|$|Economic factors, {{including}} <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> {{and other}} transfer payments, have caused great discontent, especially in Alberta.

Unlike social and health transfers, there are no restrictions over how this money is spent at the provincial level. In 2009-2010, Quebec received $8.552 billion, making it the single largest beneficiary, as it has been throughout the program's history.

50|$|<b>Equalization</b> <b>payments</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known system for the redistribution of revenue in Germany and is an important tool for the financing of regional development. Levels of awareness are raised thanks to public disagreements between the states; legal actions over the allocation of payments have been taken by various states in the Federal Constitutional Court on many occasions including 1952, 1986, 1992, 1999 and 2006. A legal action by the states of Bavaria and Baden Würtemberg is pending in 2016. For many years the <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> have accounted for 2% to 3% of state income; in 2015 <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> amounted to €9.6bn compared {{to state and local}} tax revenues of €306bn. The aim, as laid out in the German constitution, is to balance the differing financial strengths of the federal states. In this way all states are in the position to be able to comply with the responsibilities assigned to them by the constitution. Through this process the funding requirements of the federation and states are coordinated with the aim of agreeing <b>equalization</b> <b>payments,</b> this ensures that tax payers are not overburdened and maintains consistency in the standard of living across Germany.|$|R
40|$|The work of Boadway and Hayashi (2001) and Smart (2007) {{tends to}} confirm the {{hypothesis}} that provinces who are the beneficiaries of <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> adopt strategic behaviours that reduce their tax capacity and thus increase these payments. In this study, we analyze the impact that a new hydroelectricity royalty paid by Hydro-Quebec to the Quebec Treasury has on total <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> received by the province; to do this, we consider the equalization formulas used before 2004 and after 2007. This royalty, which generates approximately $ 600 million each year, reduces Quebec's <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> by just over $ 100 million, using either formula. Under {{the terms of the}} current equalization formula, Quebec loses 38 cents in equalization rights for each additional dollar of income received from natural resources. The new hydroelectricity royalty and the increase in the dividend rates applied to this government-owned corporation have made it possible for the Quebec government to benefit from a transfer of $ 1. 15 billion; on the other hand it loses $ 437 million in <b>equalization</b> <b>payments.</b> In this study, we provide and describe an important counter example to the hypothesis concerning the strategic behaviour of provinces that benefit from an equalization scheme. ...|$|R

Entitlement to <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> would depend on provincial income rather than upon a tax-by-tax comparison of the provinces’ many tax bases. For this comparison, provincial income would include revenue accruing directly to the provincial governments as well as private income of the residents of the province. Compensation would be made for the exemption of provincial resource revenue from Federal income tax.

5000|$|... see: <b>Equalization</b> <b>Payments</b> in GermanyAccording to Section 8 of the Weimar Constitution, {{taxation}} {{became a}} matter of the federal government in 1919 and the states lost their ability to generate income. Thus, the state tax law of 1920 supplied for <b>equalization</b> <b>payments</b> among the states which ensured that no state would have less than 80% of the average state tax revenue.Sections 106 and 107 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany supply for the distribution of tax revenues (horizontal and vertical equalization). This includes reducing the revenues of richer states in favour of the poorer ones. In 1915 this amounted to the re-distribution of 9.594 billion Euros from the states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and Hamburg to all the other states.|$|R
