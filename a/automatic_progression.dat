40|$|A {{long-term}} goal of game design {{research is to}} achieve end-to-end automation {{of much of the}} design process, one aspect of which is creating effective level progressions. A key diffi-culty is getting the player to practice with interesting combi-nations of learned skills while maintaining their engagement. Although recent work in task generation and sequencing has reduced this effort, we still lack end-to-end automation of the entire content design process. We approach this goal by incorporating ideas from intelligent tutoring systems and proposing progression strategies that seek to achieve mastery of not only base concepts but arbitrary combinations of these concepts. The input to our system is a model of what the player needs to do to complete each level, expressed as either an imperative procedure for producing solutions or a repre-sentation of features common to all solutions. The output is a progression of levels that can be adjusted by changing high-level parameters. We apply our framework to a popular math puzzle game and present results from 2, 377 players showing that our <b>automatic</b> level <b>progression</b> is comparable to expert-crafted progression after a few design iterations based on a key engagement metric...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{significant}} age difference between a probe and gallery face image can decrease the matching accuracy. If the face images can be normalized in age, there can be a huge impact on the face verification accuracy and thus many novel applications such as matching driver's license, passport and visa images with the real person's images can be effectively implemented. Face progression can address this issue by generating a face image for a specific age. Many researchers have attempted to address this problem focusing on predicting older faces from a younger face. In this paper, we propose a novel method for robust and <b>automatic</b> face <b>progression</b> in totally unconstrained conditions. Our method takes into account that faces belonging to the same age-groups share age patterns such as wrinkles while faces across different age-groups share some common patterns such as expressions and skin colors. Given training images of K different age-groups the proposed method learns to recover K low-rank age and one low-rank common components. These extracted components from the learning phase are used to progress an input face to younger as well as older ages in bidirectional fashion. Using standard datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed progression method outperforms state-of-the-art age progression methods and also improves matching accuracy in a face verification protocol that includes age progression...|$|R
40|$|Model {{transformation}} {{is a basic}} insight of OMG 2 ̆ 7 s Model Driven Architecture. Activity Diagram (AD) {{is one of the}} behavioral diagrams in UML and used for capturing dynamic aspects of the system. In UML 2, Activity Diagram has gone through major changes and introduced a Petri Nets like token flow semantic. AD provides comprehensive notations for process modeling and potentially suitable for wide range of application areas like service-oriented applications, workflows and other function oriented applications. A methodology for automatic transformation of UML 2 -AD into colored Petri Nets is described in this paper. The proposed approach is significant as it provides an <b>automatic</b> and seamless <b>progression</b> from the design artifacts to a formal representation. The rational of AD to CPN transformation {{based on the fact that}} the derived formal model can potentially be exploit for formal verification and validation using tools and techniques available for Colored Petri Nets...|$|R

40|$|Since hippocampal volume {{measurement}} {{is often used}} in studying Alzheimer’s disease to assess disease <b>progression,</b> <b>automatic</b> hippocampus segmentation is an important task in clinical applications. However, it is a challenging task due to its small size, complex shape, fuzzy boundaries, partial volume effects, and anatomical variability. In this {{paper we propose a}} new registration method to segment the hippocampus from brain MRI images automatically. It uses a combination of local affine transformation and optical flow based non-rigid registration, which has the advantages of modifying the larger geometric deformation and intensity differences simultaneously. Meanwhile the residual subtle differences decrease due to the high degree of freedom. Quantitative evaluation with respect to manual segmentation is performed on 10 subjects with the spatial overlap (KI value) as the evaluation criterion. The average KI with the proposed method is 0. 7749, while it is 0. 5811 with another semi-automatic method, ITK-SNAP. It is indicated that the proposed method is more accurate and will be a good choice for hippocampus segmentation...|$|R
50|$|Community of Christ has {{a largely}} {{volunteer}} priesthood, and {{all members of}} the priesthood are free to marry (as traditionally defined by the Christian community). The priesthood is divided into two orders, the Aaronic priesthood and the Melchisedec priesthood. The Aaronic order consists of the offices of deacon, teacher and priest. The Melchisedec Order consists of the offices of elder (including the specialized office of seventy) and high priest (including the specialized offices of evangelist, bishop, apostle, & prophet). Paid ministers include “appointees” and the general officers of the church, which include some specialized priesthood offices (such as the office of president, reserved for the three top members of the church leadership team). As of 1984, women have been eligible for priesthood, which is conferred through the sacrament of ordination by the laying-on-of-hands. While there is technically no age requirement for any office of priesthood, there is no <b>automatic</b> ordination or <b>progression</b> as in the LDS Church. Young people are occasionally ordained as deacon, and sometimes teacher or priest, but generally most priesthood members are called following completion of post secondary school education. In March 2007 a woman was ordained {{for the first time to}} the office of president.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Cancer Hallmark Automata, a formalism {{to model}} the progression of cancers through discrete phenotypes (so-called hallmarks). The classification of various cancers using stages and hallmarks has become common in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and not as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here aims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through <b>automatic</b> verification of <b>progression</b> models (e. g., consistency, causal connections, etc.), classification of unreachable or unstable states (e. g., “anti-hallmarks”) and computer-generated (individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a phenomenological approach, and as such does not need {{to model the}} biochemistry underlying the progression. Rather, it abstractly models transition timings between hallmarks as well as the effects of drugs and clinical tests, and thus allows formalization of temporal statements about the progression as well as notions of timed therapies. The model proposed here is ultimately based on hybrid automata (with multiple clocks), for which relevant verification and planning algorithms exist in the literature. By establishing a suitably expressive formalism, this paper also prepares the readers for its sequels, which plan to explore deeper algorithmic connections, model building techniques and realistic clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{new data}} source to {{investigate}} whether wages rise more with seniority in unionized or nonunionized workplaces. The data distinguish establishments that have incremental wage scales with <b>automatic</b> <b>progression</b> by seniority. For unions with seniority scales, the union wage differential is increasing with seniority. This {{is not the case}} for unions without seniority scales. Taking account of this heterogeneity, the authors are able to reconcile previous paradoxical empirical findings. The results provide support for discriminating monopoly models of the trade union and have important efficiency and distributional implications.

40|$|This study uses {{establishment}} {{level data}} {{to examine the}} effect of unionism on the wage structure within establishments. The major finding is that unionism substantively reduces within-establishment dispersion of wages, in part through explicit wage practices, such as single rate or <b>automatic</b> <b>progression</b> modes of wage payment as opposed to merit reviews and individual determination. Dispersion of wages between organized plants is reduced compared to dispersion of wages between unorganized plants, but by more modest amounts. Overall, the evidence suggests a major role for explicit union wage policies on dispersion of wages within firms and in the economy as a whole. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Curriculum Development Innovation and Evaluation)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the implementation of Outcomes-Based Assessment focusing mainly on progression and promotion of learners in the General Education and Training Band (Grades 1 to 9). The study was conducted in all the four Districts of the North West Department of Education, namely, Bojanala, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati and Ngaka-Modiri Molema. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. Non-experimental descriptive and exploratory quantitative research methods as well as historical and concept non-interactive qualitative research methods were employed in the study. A stratified purposive sampling technique was used to select a sample of 354 participants from a total population of 1768. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire as a quantitative data collection strategy; and both a semi-structured interview and official documents as qualitative data collection strategies. The study revealed that some schools were still using the old progression and promotion requirements that were not in line with the current national policy. The study revealed that the notion of progression with age cohort in Grades 1 to 8 was equated to <b>automatic</b> <b>progression.</b> Age cohort was interchangeably used and applied as chronological age. The study further revealed that the promotion requirements applied in Grade 9 are not aligned to both progression in Grades 1 to 8 and the promotion requirements in Grades 10 to 12. Based on the major findings of the study, it is recommended that the entire progression policy applied in Grades 1 to 8, with special reference to the notion of progression with age cohort, be reviewed. It is further recommended that the promotion requirements in Grade 9 be aligned to both progression in Grades 1 to 8 and promotion in Grades 10 to 12. It is further recommended that a similar study be conducted countrywide. Doctora...|$|E

The model proposed here is ultimately based on hybrid automata, and we show how existing controller synthesis algorithms can be generalized to CHA models, so that therapies can be generated automatically. Throughout this paper we use cancer hallmarks to represent the discrete states through which cancer progresses, but other notions of discretely or continuously varying state formalisms could also be used to derive similar therapies. ...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the past}} 150 years, {{people with disabilities}} were barely {{acknowledged}} {{in the creation of}} telecommunication. One little known fact is that when Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone he intended to create it for the use of deaf people. Many people are unaware of this fact because most financial and political decisions in our society are made by people who are not disabled. Eventually, installing phones in every building in most Western countries became a nationwide goal. However, these phones were virtually impossible for deaf people to use. Also, accessibility to telecommunication {{is an important factor in}} aiding the disabled, thereby considerations such as making payphones large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and telephones with large buttons to aid people with dexterity problems. Accessibility to telecommunications was not a major concern until the 1990s with the creation of the mobile phone and the 1996 Telecommunications Act which ensured that all telecommunication technology be available to disabled people. However, this Act did not ensure that disabled people could gain access to these technologies. This quote by Goggin and Newell explains the effect of the old telecommunication technology and the new technology such as mobile phones on the social construction of disability: “Not only are our scientific and technological enquiries (sic) manifestly both very productive and very destructive, but we will inevitably come to depend on them to resolve the very contradictions they have created.” The creation of the mobile phone in the 1990s both opened and closed doors for the disabled. With the creation of text messaging, the deaf were finally able to enter into the world of telecommunication. However, a disadvantage of the second generation mobile phones was that they caused hearing aid malfunctions due to a high level of electromagnetic interference. The phones would cause hearing aids to emit a buzzing noise which made if extremely difficult to hear and communicate. If the phone companies would have considered disability in the creation of the new phones, this would not have been a problem. However since this was not the case, the companies were forced to consider redesigning the phones. Thus, the wireless access protocol (WAP) was manufactured, a 2.5 G (generational) mobile phone and then the 3G phone. However, the 3 G phone has also proven to cause some interference with hearing aids and also because the phone is a smaller in size it can be harder to operate for disabled people. In addition, voice-mail, <b>automatic</b> answering, call <b>progression</b> announcements and the internet are unhelpful to the visually impaired as they require sight to be able to operate.|$|R
