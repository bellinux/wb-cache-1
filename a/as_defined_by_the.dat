The population density of the region is about five people per square kilometer, concentrated along the main Yokadouma-Moloundou road. The villages around the park are mostly homogeneous as there are few non-natives, most of whom work as civil servants or traders.|$|E
5|$|The aspect weaver {{analyzes}} the advice {{specified by the}} pointcut in the aspect and uses that advice to distribute the implementation code into the defined class.

5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important.

Quel., <b>as</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic {{emphasis is placed on}} the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more appropriate in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E
