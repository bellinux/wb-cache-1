40|$|In the past, the {{selection}} of the <b>address</b> <b>codes</b> for coherent optical CDMA networks was carried out with the assumption that synchronisation at both sequence bit and data bit frame levels had been achieved throughout the networks at all times (totally synchronous (TS) systems). Establishing and maintaining global synchronisation requires costly and complex hardware. One way to alleviate this problem is to acquire synchronisation by coding only prior to the transmission of data bits (partially synchronous (PS) systems). It is shown that it is essential to consider the whole correlation output sequences of the correlation processes at the decoders in order to evaluate the correlation performance of <b>address</b> <b>codes</b> in the PS systems. A mathematical method is presented to simulate the correlation processes in such systems. The method is used to evaluate the PS system correlation performances of the <b>address</b> <b>codes</b> chosen previously for TS systems. It is shown that the address codes' performances in PS systems are generally worse than in TS systems, {{and that there is a}} need to design methods for selecting <b>address</b> <b>codes</b> with certain desired correlation performance levels in PS systems. The developed mathematical method will be useful for this purpose...|$|R

Results also show that memory layout has a small effect on code size and perfor-mance when optimal addressing is used.

50|$|A {{telegraphic address}} or cable address {{was a unique}} {{identifier}} code for a recipient of telegraph messages. Operators of telegraph services regulated the use of telegraphic addresses to prevent duplication. Rather like a uniform resource locator (URL), the telegraph address did not contain any routing information (aside from possibly a city name), but instead could be looked up by telegraph office personnel, who would then manually direct {{the message to the}} office nearest the destination or to an intermediate office. Since the destination address of a telegram counted as part of the message, using a short registered <b>address</b> <b>code</b> saved the expense of sending a complete street address. Telegraph addresses were chosen either as versions of a company's name or as a memorable short word, somehow associated with the recipient. Occasionally, an organization would be best known by its telegraphic address, for example Interflora or Interpol. A telegraphic address was a valuable part of a company's corporate identity, and disputes sometimes arose when a competitor registered a telegraphic address similar to a trade name or identifier used by a rival.|$|E
