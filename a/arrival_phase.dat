To eliminate the effect of these phase errors, we propose a DOA recovery technique that relies only on magnitude measurements. This approach is inspired by phase re-trieval for applications in other fields. Ambiguities typically asso-ciated with phase retrieval methods are resolved by introducing reference targets with known DOA. The DOA estimation problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization in a sparse framework, and is solved by the recently proposed GESPAR algorithm modi-fied to accommodatemultiple snapshots. Numerical results demon-strate good DOA estimation performance. For example, the prob-ability of error in locating a single target within 2 degrees is less than 0. 1 for dB and one snapshot, and negligible for dB and five snapshots.

Clear-signature evidences of giant conductance phenomena for hole transmission without valence-band mixing through a DBRT and a superlattice were found. The giant conductance effect losses robustness by manipulating the number of superlattice layers and by including the valence-band particles coupling as well.

40|$|Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) {{have been}} studied in detail since their {{discovery}} in 1982. The integrated pulse profiles of MSPs appear to be stable, which enables precision monitoring of the pulse times of arrival (TOAs). However, for individual pulses the shape and <b>arrival</b> <b>phase</b> can vary dramatically, which is known as pulse jitter. In this paper, we investigate the stability of integrated pulse profiles for 5 MSPs, and estimate the amount of jitter for PSR J 0437 - 4715. We do not detect intrinsic profile shape variation based on integration times from ~ 10 to ~ 100 s with the provided instrumental sensitivity. For PSR J 0437 - 4715 we calculate the jitter parameter to be f_J= 0. 067 +- 0. 002, and demonstrate that the result is not significantly affected by instrumental TOA uncertainties. Jitter noise is also found to be independent of observing frequency and bandwidth around 1. 4 GHz on frequency scales of < 100 MHz, which supports the idea that pulses within narrow frequency scale are equally jittered. In addition, we point out that pulse jitter would limit TOA calculation for the timing observations with future telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array and the Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical Telescope. A quantitative understanding of pulse profile stability and the contribution of jitter would enable improved TOA calculations, which are essential for the ongoing endeavours in pulsar timing, such as the detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background.

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding a torque input command that achieves rest-to-rest motion in given time for a one-link flexible arm, avoiding residual vi-brations. In [7], we presented a method based on {{the definition of a}} system output having maximum relative degree (flat output), the planning of an interpolating poly-nomial trajectory for this output, and inverse dynamics computation of the required torque. However, the more flexible modes are considered, the higher becomes the order of the polynomials required in the trajectory planning step. This results in a peaking velocity effect, with very slow start and <b>arrival</b> <b>phases,</b> and thus in a waste of time and/or of useful torque capacities. A novel solution will be presented that enables to approximately minimize the transfer time under a maximum torque con-straint or minimize the torque needed for a given motion time. We modify the previ-ous method so as to generate torque profiles of the bang-bang type, but with smooth interpolating phases near the start, midpoint, and final instants. The method is illus-trated for an Euler-Bernoulli beam model of a one-link flexible arm with dynamic boundary conditions.

This development has leveraged decades of work on improving terminal area operations, especially the <b>arrival</b> <b>phase.</b> With APS operations, the air traffic controller instructs the participating aircraft to achieve an assigned inter-arrival spacing interval at the runway threshold, relative to another aircraft. The flight crew then uses airborne automation to manage the aircraft s speed to achieve the goal. The spacing tool is designed to keep the speed within acceptable operational limits, promote system-wide stability, and meet the assigned goal.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the automatic P-wave and S-wave arrivals picking algorithm {{which is essentially}} based on the fractal dimension and polarized method. With {{an estimate of the}} spectral exponent £^ in a 1 /f process, an interval that indicates the preferred intersection containing both noise and the P-wave is well-detected by corresponding to the minimum absolute spectral exponent £^ value along the trace. Based on the different properties of background noise and deterministic signal, the fractal dimension technique can detect the position of the P-wave. The place where the fractal dimension value changes suddenly within the intersection interval indicates the location of arrival of the P-wave. Testing that adds various levels of noise to the seismic signal shows the method can prove able to tolerate noise to a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio 1. 5. Based on the P-wave arrival, the polarized P-wave could be detected by a genetic algorithm (GA) with the strength of polarization and phase difference between the vertical and horizontal components as constraints. Using the first <b>arrival</b> <b>phase</b> as the basis phase, this study combines a polarization filter including rectilinearity functions, linear polarization, phase difference and directionality with GA to detect polarized S-wave of seismograms.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration's Next Generation Air Transportation System will combine {{advanced}} {{air traffic}} management technologies, performance-based procedures, and state-of-the-art avionics to maintain efficient operations throughout the entire <b>arrival</b> <b>phase</b> of flight. Flight deck Interval Management (FIM) operations are expected to use sophisticated airborne spacing capabilities to meet precise in-trail spacing from top-of-descent to touchdown. Recent human-in-the-loop simulations by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have found that selection of the assigned spacing goal using the runway schedule can lead to premature interruptions of the FIM operation during periods of high traffic demand. This study compares three methods for calculating the assigned spacing goal for a FIM operation that is also subject to time-based metering constraints. The particular paradigms investigated include: one based upon the desired runway spacing interval, one based upon the desired meter fix spacing interval, and a composite method that combines both intervals. These three paradigms are evaluated for the primary arrival procedures to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport using the entire set of Rapid Update Cycle wind forecasts from 2011. For typical meter fix and runway spacing intervals, the runway- and meter fix-based paradigms exhibit moderate FIM interruption rates due to their inability to consider multiple metering constraints. The addition of larger separation buffers decreases the FIM interruption rate but also significantly reduces the achievable runway throughput. The composite paradigm causes no FIM interruptions, and maintains higher runway throughput more often than the other paradigms. A key implication of the results with respect to time-based metering is that FIM operations using a single assigned spacing goal will not allow reduction of the arrival schedule's excess spacing buffer. Alternative solutions for conducting the FIM operation in a manner more compatible with the arrival schedule are discussed in detail...|$|E
