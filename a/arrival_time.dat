5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that United Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply.

25|$|The November main analysis, {{which showed}} an early <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of 57.8nanoseconds, was {{conducted}} blind to avoid observer bias, whereby those running the analysis might inadvertently fine-tune the result toward expected values. To this end, old and incomplete values for distances and delays {{from the year}} 2006 were initially adopted. With the final correction needed not yet known, the intermediate expected result was also an unknown. Analysis of the measurement data under those 'blind' conditions gave an early neutrino arrival of 1043.4nanoseconds. Afterward, the data were analyzed again taking into consideration the complete and actual sources of errors. If neutrino and light speed were the same, a subtraction value of 1043.4nanoseconds should have been obtained for the correction. However, the actual subtraction value amounted to only 985.6nanoseconds, corresponding to an <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> 57.8nanoseconds earlier than expected.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} arrival-time {{perturbations}} due to perturbations of the sound-speed profile is studied {{on the basis}} of full-wave equation modeling of the direct problem. <b>Arrival</b> <b>times</b> are analytically modeled as the time instants corresponding to the significant maxima (peaks) of the arrival pattern, in full agreement with measurement practice. In this framework the identification of actual (measured) arrivals as ray or modal ones is not required. An elegant perturbation formula is derived for the <b>arrival</b> <b>times,</b> containing the background <b>arrival</b> <b>times,</b> time derivatives of quantities associated with the background field, and also the functional derivative of the background field with respect to the sound-speed profile. This formula is of a system-theoretic nature and can be applied to any kind of environment, either range-dependent or range-independent. The restriction to the range- independent environment permits further elaboration of the perturbation formula since, in this case, the functional derivative of the acoustic- channel transfer function can be analytically expressed, e. g., in terms of normal modes. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by studying two test cases: the linear- and the canonical-profile waveguide. The agreement between actual <b>arrival</b> <b>times,</b> obtained by numerically solving the direct propagation problem, and the <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> predicted by means of the perturbation formula is very satisfactory. Since the proposed scheme can predict arrival-time perturbations even in cases that the <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> cannot be identified as ray or modal ones, it is expected to be helpful in extending the applicability of ocean acoustic tomography...|$|R

While for S waves, 28 % and 47 % of all 1, 520 readings are |O-C| < 2 s and 4 s, respectively. These facts indicate how S readings are worth than P readings. Phase data for which the travel–time residuals exceeded 3 s were not considered in the calculation.|$|R

25|$|Supreme Commander {{introduced}} several innovations {{designed to}} reduce the amount of micromanagement inherent in many RTS games. Holding the shift key causes any orders given to a unit (or group of units) to be queued. In this manner a unit may be ordered to attack several targets in succession, or to make best speed to a given point on the map and then attack towards a specified location engaging any hostiles it encounters along the way. After orders have been issued, holding the shift key causes all issued orders to be displayed on the map where they can be subsequently modified to accommodate a change of plan. Further, when a unit is ordered to attack a target, the player can issue an order to perform a coordinated attack to another unit. This order coordinates the <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of the units at the target automatically by adjusting the speed of the units involved.|$|E
25|$|Since neutrinos {{could not}} be {{accurately}} tracked to the specific protons producing them, an averaging method had to be used. The researchers added up the measured proton pulses to get an average distribution in time of the individual protons in a pulse. The time at which neutrinos were detected at Gran Sasso was plotted to produce another distribution. The two distributions were expected to have similar shapes, but be separated by 2.4milliseconds, {{the time it takes}} to travel the distance at light speed. The experimenters used an algorithm, maximum likelihood, to search for the time shift that best made the two distributions to coincide. The shift so calculated, the statistically measured neutrino <b>arrival</b> <b>time,</b> was approximately 60nanoseconds shorter than the 2.4milliseconds neutrinos would have taken if they traveled just at light speed. In a later experiment, the proton pulse width was shortened to 3nanoseconds, and this helped the scientists to narrow the generation time of each detected neutrino to that range.|$|E
25|$|All Hands Down {{was written}} by Kenneth R. Sewell, a nuclear {{engineer}} and a U.S. Navy veteran who spent five years aboard , a fast attack submarine. It attempts to link the sinking of Scorpion with the Pueblo incident, the John Anthony Walker spy ring, and Cold War Soviet aggression. The thesis of this book is that action off the Canary Islands was the direct cause of the sinking. The author purports that this is supported by motives in the Soviet Navy following the sinking of K-129, which caused the Russian Navy to trap a U.S. submarine. The bait for this trap would be strange military operations and furtive naval manoeuvres in the Atlantic, accompanied by countermeasures that would only seemingly be defeated by the deployment of a nuclear submarine. With information from spying by Walker, the position and <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of Scorpion was known by the Russians, and its sinking followed the springing of the trap. The book claims Scorpion was sunk by a Ka-25 helicopter equipped with anti-submarine torpedoes, which took off from one ship and landed on a different one. This was so that no one, other than the aircrew of the helicopter, would notice one torpedo missing.|$|E
