50|$|<b>Ademption</b> arises {{where the}} {{testator}} leaves a legacy in a will, and thereafter, in his lifetime, voluntarily alienates {{the subject matter}} of the legacy, as when Rodney bequeaths a farm to Shaun, and then sells or donates it. If this happens, the legacy is regarded as having been tacitly revoked, or “adeemed,” as it has lapsed by <b>ademption.</b>|$|E

50|$|In Wisconsin, {{state law}} (854.08) {{attempts}} {{to abolish the}} common law doctrine of <b>ademption</b> by extinction, by, for example, awarding beneficiaries {{the balance of the}} purchase price of the item sold (subject to some limitations).|$|E
50|$|<b>Ademption,</b> or <b>ademption</b> by extinction, is {{a common}} law {{doctrine}} used in the law of wills to determine what happens when property bequeathed under a will {{is no longer in}} the testator's estate {{at the time of the}} testator's death. For a devise (bequest) of a specific item of property (a specific gift), such property is considered adeemed, and the gift fails. For example, if a will bequeathed the testator's car to a specific beneficiary, but the testator owned no car at the time of his or her death, the gift would be adeemed and the aforementioned beneficiary would receive no gift at all.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ademption</b> may be waived if the {{property}} leaves the estate after the testator {{has been declared}} incompetent. Furthermore, {{in some cases the}} beneficiary will be entitled to the proceeds from the sale of property, or to the insurance payout for property that is lost or destroyed.|$|E
50|$|As for {{the sale}} of land under an {{executory}} contract, traditional case law agrees that <b>ademption</b> occurs upon the death of the testator and that the proceeds of sale, when the closing occurs, should not pass to the specific devisee of the property. However, the more modern view and the Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted by some states, disagrees. These jurisdictions find that when property subject to specific devise is placed under contract of sale before the decedent's death, the proceeds of the sale will pass to the specific devisee.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ademption</b> by {{satisfaction}}, {{also known}} as satisfaction of legacies, is a common law doctrine that determines the disposition of property under a will when the testator has made lifetime gifts to beneficiaries named in the will. Under the doctrine, a gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to a named beneficiary of the will is treated as an advance payment of that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the lifetime gift to satisfy a bequest under the will, {{the amount of the}} lifetime gift is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under the will.|$|E
50|$|In Virginia, <b>ademption</b> {{occurs with}} respect to most forms of {{property}}, but if the property at issue is stock certificates, then the buyout of the issuer of the stock by another company, and the swapping of the stocks for a new issue by that company, will not adeem the gift of stock. Similarly, if the shares of stock that existed {{at the time the}} gift was made have split (for example, where the holder of 500 shares receives a reissue of 1,000 shares each having half the value of the original), then the beneficiary of that gift will be entitled to the number of shares that exist after the split.|$|E
40|$|The 1990 {{revision}} of the Uniform Probate Code (2 ̆ 2 UPC 2 ̆ 2) marks {{the second stage of}} probate reform {{in the second half of}} this century. The first stage was the adoption of the original UPC. While it included some changes in the substantive law of wills, its primary objective was to simplify probate procedure. The second stage, by contrast, focuses almost entirely on the substantive law of wills and will substitutes. It changes several of the primary rules of wills law, including the traditional rule requiring strict compliance with execution formalities. It also makes significant changes in the subsidiary rules of wills law, including the antilapse and revocation on divorce rules. The overall effect of these changes is to reduce the level of formality in the American law of wills. Along with other emerging doctrinal changes, the 1990 UPC signals a shift in wills law toward greater reliance on extrinsic evidence and, more generally, greater informality. After these changes are eventually implemented, wills law no longer will be regarded as the last bastion of high formality. In this brief Article, I will discuss the decline of formality in wills law in the context of the doctrine of <b>ademption</b> by extinction. Section 2 - 606 of the 1990 UPC overtly abandons the traditional formal approach to resolving issues concerning <b>ademption</b> of devises. It explicitly invites courts to inquire into the testator 2 ̆ 7 s intent on the basis of extrinsic evidence rather than limiting the inquiry to the terms of the will, as the traditional approach does. By opening up <b>ademption</b> analysis to extrinsic evidence regarding the testator 2 ̆ 7 s subjective preferences, new section 2 - 606 signals an apparent shift from what Carol Rose calls a 2 ̆ 2 crystal 2 ̆ 2 rule to a 2 ̆ 2 mud 2 ̆ 2 rule. This Article makes two basic points. The first is that the shift from the formal 2 ̆ 2 identity 2 ̆ 2 rule to the informal 2 ̆ 2 intent 2 ̆ 2 standard is less dramatic than initially appears. Although the new version of section 2 - 606 will produce some differences in result, the traditional judicial approach to <b>ademption</b> questions provided courts with considerable room to avoid plainly intent-frustrating results. Section 2 - 606 represents a sensible doctrinal reform that incrementally changes the law in a way that is likely to strengthen the extent to which wills law reflects rather than frustrates testamentary preferences. The second point is explanatory. To the extent that section 2 - 606 does represent an actual shift to less formality on this question, the change is the result of endogenous factors. Section 2 - 606 occupies only a small corner of new article II, but it provides a useful opportunity to discuss the circumstances that have led to relaxing the degree of formality in wills law...|$|E
40|$|The {{makeup of}} the class of {{beneficiaries}} and the composition of the property affected by a will may be substantially altered by events occurring after the execution of the will by the testator. Naturally, such alterations may materially disrupt the testamentary plan. Such changes in beneficiaries typically involve the application of the state 2 ̆ 7 s so-called lapse statutes. In his Article, Professor Chaffin explores the Georgia statutory scheme and the problems which have arisen thereunder. In a subsequent article to appear in this volume, he will investigate the effects of <b>ademption</b> and abatement of property passing under the will...|$|E
40|$|Insights from {{economics}} {{and the economic}} analysis of law {{may be useful in}} analyzing succession law, including intestacy and wills as well as nonprobate transfers such as trusts. After surveying prior works that have examined succession from a functional perspective, I explore the possibility of utilizing tools like (i) transaction costs, (ii) the ex ante/ex post distinction, and (iii) rules versus standards, to illuminate the design of the Uniform Probate Code. Specifically, I investigate how these tools, which legal scholars have employed widely in other contexts, may be relevant in understanding events like the nonprobate revolution and issues like “dead hand” control; analyzing UPC provisions pertaining to the harmless error rule, reformation, and <b>ademption</b> by extinction; and evaluating law reforms such as proposals to abolish attestation or prevent the disinheritance of children...|$|E
40|$|The new Restatement (Third) of Property (officially the Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers), {{in tandem}} with the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, is {{systematically}} proceeding through the whole field of wills, will substitutes, trusts, and estates. Both of the new Restatements should prove to be handy resources for trust and estate lawyers, not only in preparing to argue cases at both trial and appellate levels, but also in the everyday work of drafting and construing dispositive provisions in wills, trusts, and other types of donative documents. Each Restatement section is followed by a set of Comments explaining and illustrating the black letter and by Reporter 2 ̆ 7 s Notes collecting relevant cases, statutes, and secondary sources. The division of coverage between the Restatement of Property and the Restatement of Trusts is governed more by the history of the American Law Institute (the ALI or Institute) than by logic. The Trusts Restatement is primarily concerned with the validity and administration of trusts, including fiduciary duties of trustees. The Property Restatement is primarily concerned with the validity of gifts, wills, and will substitutes, but also with the construction of the dispositive provisions in trusts as well as those in wills and will substitutes. Consequently, in construing the meaning of a dispositive provision in a trust, the relevant Restatement is the Restatement of Property, not the Restatement of Trusts. The first two volumes of the Restatement (Third) of Property have now been approved by the ALI and published in hard-bound volumes. Volume 1, published in 1999, covers intestacy, execution and revocation of wills, and post-execution events affecting the meaning of wills, such as <b>ademption,</b> lapse, and antilapse statutes. Volume 2, published in 2003, covers gifts, will substitutes, capacity, undue influence, the elective share of the surviving spouse, 2 ̆ 7 construction, 2 reformation, 3 and modification of wills 4 and other donative documents. 5 Volume 3, which is scheduled to be published in 2007, will cover class gifts and powers of appointment. Although the material on class gifts, the subject of this brief survey, is not yet published in a hard-bound volume, it is published in soft-cover as Tentative Draft No. 4 (2004), and has been approved in principle by the ALI at the 2004 annual meeting. The class-gift material is available from the AL 6 and is also accessible online from Westlaw and Lexis. A parallel project is currently working its way through the processes of the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) for amending the Uniform Probate Code (UPC). That project is not as comprehensive as the class gift material in the new Restatement, but does overlap the rules of construction on questions of status of adopted children, nonmarital children, and children of assisted reproduction. 7 The drafting committee has now approved measures that are largely consistent with the Restatement. Following ULC procedures, the current draft will be given a first reading at the 2007 annual meeting and, after further review and refinement, a final reading and approval at the 2008 annual meeting. To the extent that the UPC amendments, as finally approved, turn out to be in accord with the Restatement, the two will reinforce each other and strengthen the credibility of both...|$|E
