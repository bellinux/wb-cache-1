40|$|Apple is nutritionally {{valuable}} and present as fresh fruit in human nutrition throughout the year. Also apple is a raw material in food processing, {{primarily in the}} production of juices, nectars, refreshing soft drinks, marmalades, jams, <b>compotes,</b> <b>apple</b> cider vinegar and dried fruits. In the last decade on the world market there is a great interest in dried apple products (commercially called apple chips). During preservation by drying the technological process aimed at the final product of optimal quality is required. The subject of this paper is the kinetics of the apple cv. Granny Smith, cv. Idared and cv. Jonagold drying in laboratory dehydrator for the purpose of pinpointing at which level of humidity the maximum speed of evaporation is achieved and at which level of humidity apple slices begin to change in colour and geometric shape. Parameters of the drying process were the same for all three cultivars, 3 hrs at air temperature of 70 oC and 5 hrs at air temperature of 50 o. The amount of evaporated water is expressed in relative and absolute units of measure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine which one of the three tested cultivars provides the best properties for drying, i. e. in terms of oxidation of polyphenolic compounds to find the cultivar which will provide that the final product is technologically and organoleptically the most acceptable. The results showed that the sample cv. Granny Smith expressed the least oxidation of polyphenolic compounds (browning), curved edges and shrivelled apple slices. After that the sample cv. Jonagold followed. The sample cv. Idared showed the worst results. Following the drying kinetics of all three samples, it can be concluded that the cultivars Granny Smith and Jonagold were achieving the lower maximum speed of evaporation, unlike the cultivar Idared. The cultivars Granny Smith and Jonagold have attained consistent drying and in this way the technological process was finished with a smaller temperature stress for plant tissue, resulting in a much better quality of the final product...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Patulin {{has raised}} the {{international}} attention because of its health risk. In fact, it has mutagenic, neurotoxic, immunotoxic, genotoxic and gastrointestinal effects in animals. In the present work, patulin and patulin-producing Penicillium spp. in apple and apple-based products marketed in Qatar were analysed. Methodology: Sampling was carried out using apple fruits and apple-based products. Fungi were isolated from undamaged apples, apple juice and baby apple food. DNA extraction was carried out with DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, USA). The molecular identification of fungal isolates was carried out using ITS 1 -ITS 4 PCR. PCR products were sequenced and blasted. Patulin was extracted and analyzed by LC/MS/MS, then quantified using Agilent 1290 UHPLC coupled to 6460 triple quadruple mass spectrometer. Results: Forty-five samples of undamaged fresh apple fruits, apple juice and apple-based baby food products sold in different markets in Qatar were surveyed for both fungal and patulin contamination using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometery (LC/MS/MS). Twenty-five Penicillium spp. isolates were selected, including 23 P. expansum and one isolate each of P. brevicompactum and P. commune. All the tested Penicillium spp. isolates produced patulin in vitro (from 40 to 100 μg/g on Malt Yeast Extract agar medium). Patulin was detected in 100 % of apple juice samples at levels ranging from 5. 27 to 82. 21 μg/kg. Only 5 samples contained patulin levels higher than European Union recommended limit (50 μg/kg). The average patulin contamination was 30. 67 μg/kg and 10. 92 μg/kg in baby apple juice and in baby <b>apple</b> <b>compote,</b> respectively.
