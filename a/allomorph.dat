2500|$|The {{dimensional}} prefixes of {{the verb}} chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase. Like the latter, they {{are attached to}} a [...] "head" [...] – a pronominal prefix. The other place where a pronominal prefix can be placed is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different <b>allomorph</b> and expresses the absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below. However, this neat system is obscured by the tendency to drop or merge many of the prefixes in writing and possibly in pronunciation as well. -da-, -ta-, -ši- (early -še3-), occurring in this order, are the comitative, ablative and terminative verbal prefixes; the dative (occurring before the others) is probably /-a-/, and a directive /-i-/ (occurring after the others) is widely recognized as well. The pronominal prefixes are /-n-/ and /-b-/ for the 3rd person singular animate and inanimate respectively; the 2nd person singular appears as -e- in most contexts, but as /-r-/ before the dative (-ra-), leading some to assume a phonetic /-ir-/ or /-jr-/. The 1st person may appear as -e-, too, but is more commonly not expressed at all (the same may frequently apply to 3rd and 2nd persons); it is, however, cued by the choice of mu- as conjugation prefix (/mu-/ + /-a-/ → ma-). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd plural infixes are -me-,-re?- and -ne- in the dative and perhaps in other contexts as well, though not in the pre-stem position (see below). An additional exception from the system is the prefix -ni- which corresponds to a noun phrase in the locative – in which case it doesn't seem to be preceded by a pronominal prefix – and, according to Gábor Zólyomi and others, to an animate one in the directive – {{in the latter case}} it is analyzed as pronominal /-n-/ + directive /-i-/. Zólyomi and others also believe that special meanings can be expressed by combinations of non-identical noun case and verb prefix. Also according to some researchers /-ni-/ and /bi-/ acquire the forms /-n-/ and /-b-/ (coinciding with the absolutive–ergative pronominal prefixes) before the stem if there isn't already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position: mu-un-kur9 = /mu-ni-kur/ [...] "he went in there" [...] (as opposed to mu-ni-kur9 = mu-ni-in-kur9 = /mu-ni-n-kur/ [...] "he brought in – caused [...] to go in – there".|$|E

Instead, {{it appears that the}} system has undergone a radical reanalysis, whereby the suffixed forms are now projectable by general principles from the isolation forms. More precisely, a pattern of multiple predictability has developed: the form of suffixed <b>allomorphs</b> is largely predictable from the isolation <b>allomorphs,</b> but the older pattern, whereby isolation <b>allomorphs</b> can be predicted from the suffixed <b>allomorphs,</b> also persists. From this descriptive result, two principal theoretical consequences are developed: (a) Yidi ¯ possesses a fully-productive pattern of alternation that is not driven by phonotactic constraints; (b) there are more relations of predictability among surface forms in Yidi ¯ than can be treated by the normal method, namely that of deriving all the surface <b>allomorphs</b> from a single underlying representation. To develop an analysis compatible with these findings, two devices are invoked. First, it is suggested that the theoretical arsenal of Optimality Theory should be expanded to include “Anticorrespondence ” constraints, which actively require alternation. They do so by specifying string mappings between the <b>allomorphs</b> of morphemes as they occur in various contexts. Second, I suggest tentatively that the underlying representation be abandoned as the means of characterizing crossparadigm similarity, {{to be replaced by a}} combination of Paradigm Uniformity and Anticorrespondence constraints. Using these devices, an explicit analysis for Yidi¯ is proposed and tested. Hayes Anticorrespondence in Yidi ¯ p. 2 Anticorrespondence in Yidi ¯...|$|R
