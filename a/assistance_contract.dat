With {{an annual budget of}} over $ 700 million, the program is RHS's largest line-item appropriation, accounting for approximately 70 percent of the agency's budget. In early 2003, RHS reported {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in unexpended balances, primarily tied to 5 - and 20 -year contracts issued from 1978 through 1982. Concern has arisen that these unexpended balances may be the result of the agency's budget practices, especially its procedures for estimating funding needs. GAO was asked to assess the accuracy of RHS's budget estimates for the rental assistance program, the activity level of rental <b>assistance</b> <b>contracts</b> issued from 1978 through 1997, and the activity level of rental <b>assistance</b> <b>contracts</b> issued from 1998 through 2002 and the accuracy of RHS's estimates of the rate at which these funds would be used. ...|$|R

In early 2003, RHS reported {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in unexpended balances, primarily tied to 5 - and 20 -year contracts issued from 1978 through 1982.

50|$|Predictable, reliable, stable funding. The Mod. Rehab. {{program was}} {{repealed}} {{due to a}} scandal {{having to do with}} how HUD awarded the <b>assistance</b> <b>contracts.</b> The effects of the scandal linger in the form of relatively unfavorable renewal terms, which are embedded in MAHRAA. Specifically, renewal rents must be at the lesser of current rents, as adjusted; Fair Market Rent; or market rent. This means that properties with below-market rents can renew only at similar rent levels, as adjusted by what is typically a modest amount. Since HUD does not offer multiyear contracts, the rents are re-set each year at contract renewal.|$|R
50|$|Enacted in 1965 and 1968, respectively, the Rent Supplement (Rent Supp.) and Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) {{programs}} are both rental assistance programs governed by contracts between private owners and HUD. While both programs' funding platforms {{are in this}} way similar to the project-based section 8 HAP, neither program is a section 8 program subject to renewal under MAHRAA. In fact, neither type of program <b>assistance</b> <b>contract</b> is renewable. Fully funded {{at the time the}} programs were enacted years ago, each rental <b>assistance</b> <b>contract</b> simply runs its course, with a hard expiration date after which tenants may receive tenant-based rental assistance, but the properties themselves are no longer deeply affordable. Many Rent Supp/RAP-assisted properties — like Mod. Rehab.-assisted properties — are partially assisted; this is partly a function {{of the fact that the}} per-unit assistance levels have declined relative to operating costs over time, so more and more units have become unassisted. Conversion to the project-based section 8 platform under RAD makes it possible for owners of Rent Supp./RAP-assisted properties to move to a renewable form of contract, receive fresh capital investment in their properties, and retain deeply affordable rents for the income-eligible tenants residing in them.|$|E

5000|$|The {{government}} of Salta Province initiated {{the reform of}} its water sector in 1996. At the same time many other Argentinean provinces and municipalities brought {{in the private sector}} to improve water and sanitation services. While Salta also followed this approach, the process differed somewhat from the one in many other parts of Argentina. First, the provincial government conducted a series of meetings with municipalities and user organizations to discuss the benefits and risks of the concession before it was bid out. This process of consultations was continued by the private concessionaire after the contract was awarded. Second, the government decided from the onset that water and sanitation services in the poor province could not be financed entirely through tariff revenues. It thus decided to finance much of the investments to be undertaken by the private concessionaire with public grants, in addition to providing consumption subsidies. Third, the regulatory agency allowed the concessionaire to provide services at a lower standard in remote or isolated areas that were deemed unprofitable at conventional service standards. Fourth, the provincial regulatory agency granted tariff increases before and even after the 2001 economic crisis. These tariff increases were lower {{than it would have been}} necessary without subsidies or flexible service standards.

50|$|It was {{reported}} in January 1961 the Nkrumah administration desired minimal foreign influence in Ghanaian affairs, and saw Ghana Airways as a prime symbol of Ghana's statehood. On 14 February 1961, the Ghanaian government reached agreement with BOAC to buy the latter out of their 40 percent share in the airline, for a reported ₤160,000. The cheque was presented to Sir Duncan Cumming on 15 February, who {{at the same time}} signed a contract renewing the management <b>assistance</b> <b>contract</b> which dated back to July 1958. On delivery of the second Britannia, in December 1960 the new turboprops took over service from the wet-leased BOAC aircraft on the airline's route to London. In June 1961, Ghana Airways commenced the first-ever non-stop Accra-London air connection, also using Britannias, and in July the government announced that the airline would be reorganised. The order for two Boeing 707s, which had been placed in January 1961, was cancelled in August due to difficulties in financing the purchase; in 1961 the airline lost US$800,000. The airline took delivery of the three Viscounts and an additional two Il-18s in 1962, for a total of eight Ilyushins. A weekly flight from Accra to Kumasi, Tamale, Ouagadougou, Mopti, Ségou and Bamako was inaugurated on 4 July 1962 utilising a Douglas DC-3. The pool arrangement with BOAC was terminated in November 1962, three years before its expected July 1965 expiry, after Ghana Airways signed a pool agreement with Alitalia covering flights between Accra and Rome. BOAC saw this arrangement with the Italian airline to be in competition with their agreement with the Ghanaian airline, under which Ghana Airways would be required to sell tickets for both airlines on the Accra-London route, which {{in the case of the}} Alitalia would be operated via Rome. By January 1963 the relationship with BOAC was almost nonexistent, as British United Airways took over general sales agent duties for the airline in the United Kingdom and Cunard Eagle was responsible for major maintenance on the airlines' aircraft. However, BOAC continued to provide passenger ground handling services for the airline at Heathrow Airport. By this time, the airline was operating domestic flights from Accra to Kumasi, Takoradi and Tamale, with regional flights being operated to Abidjan, Bamako, Bathurst, Conakry, Dakar, Freetown, Lagos and Monrovia. The airlines' international route network saw the airline flying to Addis Ababa, Beirut, Cairo, Khartoum, London, Rabat, Rome and Zürich.|$|E
