Schmitt's ambitious proposal included the launch into lunar orbit of special communications satellites based on the existing TIROS satellites to allow contact with the astronauts during their powered descent and lunar surface operations.

25|$|The {{securities}} can {{be issued}} {{with either a}} fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the “coupon” (rate) {{at the time of}} issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. Floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the <b>added</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
25|$|In researching human disease, {{model organisms}} allow for better {{understanding}} the disease process without the <b>added</b> <b>risk</b> of harming a human. The species chosen will usually meet a determined taxonomic equivalency to humans, {{so as to}} react to disease or its treatment {{in a way that}} resembles human physiology as needed. Although biological activity in a model organism does not ensure an effect in humans, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. There are three main types of disease models: homologous, isomorphic and predictive. Homologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease. Isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments. Predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects, but are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in previous research {{that it might be}} worthwhile to include risk measures in the balanced scorecard (BSC) or to rework it in order to manage risk. The literature review in this study indicated that some conceptual and case study research has been done to investigate how an organisation could go about accomplishing this. A number of researchers noted that including risk measures {{on the face of the}} scorecard might lead to a problem of over-complexity. Using content analysis as the method of inquiry, this study explored how organisations are currently <b>adding</b> <b>risk</b> to their scorecards. The key finding of the study was that organisations that have reported <b>adding</b> <b>risk</b> measures to their BSCs are predominantly <b>adding</b> <b>risk</b> measures to the face of their scorecards. This finding is interesting because it would indicate that the previously reported and conceptualised problem of complexity does not seem to have such a great impact as previously thought.

25|$|Despite this estrangement, {{the couple}} again met foxhunting and resumed a {{discreet}} relationship. Marshall Field {{was at first}} unimpressed by the impecunious Beatty as a future son-in-law, but was persuaded by his heroic reputation, impressive record of promotion and future prospects. There was the possibility that Field might revoke the settlement he had made on his daughter {{at the time of}} her first marriage and the new couple would have no means of support. Beatty's father was also unhappy about the match, fearing a repeat of the difficulties he had faced with his own relationship with a married woman, but with the <b>added</b> <b>risk</b> of publicity because both Beatty and Ethel were famous and the risk that Beatty's illegitimacy might be exposed. Beatty went so far as to consult a fortune teller, Mrs. Roberts, who predicted a fine outcome to the match. Ethel wrote to Arthur, telling him that it was her firm intention never to live with him again as his wife, though not naming any particular person or reason. Arthur agreed to co-operate, and filed for divorce in America on the grounds of desertion, which was granted 9 May 1901. Beatty and Ethel married on 22 May 1901 at the registry office, St. George's, Hanover Square, London with no family attending. Although Arthur Tree was himself from a wealthy American family, he now had to adjust to reduced circumstances without Ethel's support. He elected to remain in Britain and their son Ronald remained with him. Ronald and his mother were never reconciled from his perception that she had deserted his father, but he visited in later life and became friendly with Beatty. Ronald later became a member of parliament and, during the Second World War became a link between the British and United States governments, lending his country house, Ditchley Park near Oxford, to Winston Churchill for weekend visits when the official residences were considered unsafe. Beatty and Ethel set up home at Hanover Lodge in Regent's Park, London.|$|E
500|$|The first {{witnesses}} to testify were the Gibraltar Police officers {{involved in the}} operation and its aftermath. Following them, on 7 September, was [...] "Mr O", the senior MI5 officer in charge of Operation Flavius. [...] "O" [...] told the inquest that, in January 1988, Belgian authorities found a car being used by IRA operatives in Brussels. In the car were found a quantity of Semtex, detonators, and equipment for a radio detonation device, which, [...] "O" [...] told the coroner, led MI5 {{to the conclusion that}} the IRA might use a similar device for the planned attack in Gibraltar. MI5 further believed that the IRA had been unlikely to use a [...] "blocking car" [...] (an empty vehicle used to hold a parking space until the bombers bring in the vehicle containing the explosives) as this entailed the <b>added</b> <b>risk</b> of multiple border crossings.

40|$|Many {{papers in}} the litterature have adopted the {{expected}} utility paradigm to analyze insurance decisions. Insurance companies manage policies by growing, by <b>adding</b> independent <b>risks.</b> Even if <b>adding</b> <b>risks</b> generally ultimately decreases the probability of insolvency, {{the impact on the}} insurer's expected utility is less clear. Indeed, it is not true that the risk aversion toward the additional loss generated by a new policy included in an insurance portfolio is a decreasing function of the number of contracts already underwritten (i. e. the "fallacy of large numbers"). In this paper, it is shown that most commonly used utility functions do not necessarily positively value the aggregation of independent risks so that they are not éligible for insurers. This casts some doubt about the conclusions drawn in the papers postulating such completely monotonic utilities for guiding insurers' choices. Finally, it is shown that the sufficient conditions for <b>adding</b> <b>risks</b> that {{can be found in the}} litterature need to be refined by restricting the domain of definition of the insurer's utility function. expected utility, compensating premium, prudence, temperance...|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1916, Aderca {{attacked}} {{the claim that}} Jewish identity was monolithic, seeing it as inherently discriminatory. To him, the supposed Jewish [...] "types" [...] appeared [...] "antagonistic", making the claim to Jewish nationhood doubtful. Commenting on Romania's postponement of Jewish emancipation, he protested that, at the <b>added</b> <b>risk</b> of enforcing prejudice about Jews being lazy and profiteering, {{members of the community}} were being actively prevented from engaging in any line of work other than commerce. Later, he parodied such accusations: [...] "since they could not live on land, 'fish have monopolized the ponds' [...] ". In a December 1922 issue of Contimporanul, under the title Deschideți bordeluri! ("Open up Brothels!"), he ridiculed the far-right's demand for a Jewish quota in universities, arguing that government toleration of antisemitic agitation was turning the students into hooligans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{liquidity}} premium theory is {{an offshoot of}} the pure expectations theory. [...] The {{liquidity premium}} theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the <b>added</b> <b>risk</b> of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher {{not just because of the}} liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. [...] The market expectations hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory: ...|$|E
