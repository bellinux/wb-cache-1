5|$|In March 2013, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, having detected <b>a</b> <b>marked</b> change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012.

60|$|It is {{of course}} quite as {{practicable}} to arrive at new conclusions from facts assumed, as from facts observed; from fictitious, as from real, inductions. Deduction, as we have seen, consists {{of a series of}} inferences in this form—a is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of b, b of c, c of d, therefore <b>a</b> is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d, which last may be a truth inaccessible to direct observation. In like manner it is allowable to say, suppose that <b>a</b> were <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of b, b of c, and c of d, a would be <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d, which last conclusion was not thought of by those who laid down the premises. A system of propositions as complicated as geometry might be deduced from assumptions which are false; as was done by Ptolemy, Descartes, and others, in their attempts to explain synthetically the phenomena of the solar system on the supposition that the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies were the real motions, or were produced in some way more or less different from the true one. Sometimes the same thing is knowingly done, for the purpose of showing the falsity of the assumption; which is called a reductio ad absurdum. In such cases, the reasoning is as follows: <b>a</b> is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of b, and b of c; now if c were also <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d, <b>a</b> would be <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d; but d is known to be <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of the absence of a; consequently a would be <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of its own absence, which is a contradiction; therefore c is not <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d.|$|R

60|$|In {{the more}} complex {{branches}} of knowledge, the deductions seldom consist, as in the examples hitherto exhibited, of a single chain, <b>a</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of b, b of c, c of d, therefore <b>a</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d. They consist (to carry on the same metaphor) of several chains united at the extremity, as thus: <b>a</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of d, b of e, c of f, d e f of n, therefore a b c <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of n. Suppose, for example, the following combination of circumstances: 1st, rays of light impinging on a reflecting surface; 2d, that surface parabolic; 3d, those rays {{parallel to each other}} and to the axis of the surface. It is to be proved that the concourse of these three circumstances is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that the reflected rays will pass through the focus of the parabolic surface. Now, each of the three circumstances is singly <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of something material to the case. Rays of light impinging on a reflecting surface are <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that those rays will be reflected at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. The parabolic form of the surface, is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that, from any point of it, a line drawn to the focus and a line parallel to the axis will make equal angles with the surface. And finally, the parallelism of the rays to the axis is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that their angle of incidence coincides with one of these equal angles. The three marks taken together are therefore <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> of all these three things united. But the three united are evidently <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that the angle of reflection must coincide with the other of the two equal angles, that formed by a line drawn to the focus; and this again, by the fundamental axiom concerning straight lines, is <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that the reflected rays pass through the focus. Most chains of physical deduction are of this more complicated type; and even in mathematics such are abundant, as in all propositions where the hypothesis includes numerous conditions: “If a circle be taken, and if within that circle a point be taken, not the centre, and if straight lines be drawn from that point to the circumference, then,” etc.|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by <b>a</b> <b>marked</b> warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares {{believed}} this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.|$|E
