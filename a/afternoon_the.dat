5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> Allies took the {{opportunity}} to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell.

5|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch.

5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider group for the British.

5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron.

The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|As the {{fighting}} {{to the west}} proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. line ran in a semicircle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.|$|E

5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane here does not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E
5|$|Both fleets were {{at first}} {{hampered}} by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes {{lined up for}} battle and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up in a similar formation, Suffren gave the order to attack, and battle began shortly after four in the <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> action lasted around three hours and resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. The British had 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.|$|E

5|$|By early <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> Union XI Corps, {{commanded}} by Major General Oliver Otis Howard, had arrived, and the Union position {{was in a}} semicircle from west to north of the town. The Confederate Second Corps under Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell began a massive assault from the north, with Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division attacking across the open fields north of town. The Union lines generally held under extremely heavy pressure, although the salient at Barlow's Knoll was overrun.|$|E
5|$|By early <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft {{found that it was}} barely a tropical storm. After stalling during the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E

5|$|Despite several counterattacks {{during the}} <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders {{managed to hold}} their front line, {{including}} the village of Flers, although both flanks remained exposed due {{to the failure of}} 41st and 47th Divisions to reach or hold their frontage of the Blue Line. It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of its objectives although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was actually in 41st Division's sector.|$|E
