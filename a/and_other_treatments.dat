25|$|Low back pain. A 2013 Cochrane review {{found very}} low to {{moderate}} evidence that SMT {{was no more}} effective than inert interventions, sham SMT or as an adjunct therapy for acute low back pain. The same review found that SMT {{appears to be no}} better than other recommended therapies. A 2016 review found moderate evidence indicating that chiropractic care seems to be effective as physical therapy for low back pain. A 2012 overview of systematic reviews found that collectively, SM failed to show it is an effective intervention for pain. A 2011 Cochrane review found strong evidence that suggests there is no clinically meaningful difference between SMT <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>treatments</b> for reducing pain and improving function for chronic low back pain. A 2010 Cochrane review found no current evidence to support or refute a clinically significant difference between the effects of combined chiropractic interventions and other interventions for chronic or mixed duration low back pain. A 2010 systematic review found that most studies suggest SMT achieves equivalent or superior improvement in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up. Specific guidelines concerning the treatment of nonspecific (i.e. unknown cause) low back pain are inconsistent between countries.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his diagnosis, Jobs {{resisted}} his doctors' {{recommendations for}} medical intervention for nine months, instead {{relying on a}} pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment [...] "led to an unnecessarily early death". Other doctors agree that Jobs's diet was insufficient to address his disease. Cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski, for instance, said, [...] "My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that." [...] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's integrative medicine department, said, [...] "Jobs's faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life.... He had {{the only kind of}} pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable.... He essentially committed suicide." [...] According to Jobs's biographer, Walter Isaacson, [...] "for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer – a decision he later regretted as his health declined". [...] "Instead, he tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>treatments</b> he found online, and even consulted a psychic. He was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004." [...] He eventually underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or [...] "Whipple procedure") in July 2004, that appeared to remove the tumor successfully. Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. During Jobs's absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.|$|E
