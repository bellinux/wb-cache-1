5|$|During Castro's illness, which {{culminated in}} his 2008 resignation, Payá {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Cuban government as it transferred power to Castro's brother Raúl. He called on Raul Castro to allow multiparty elections and free all political prisoners, and delivered a petition <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> the Cuban people be granted freedom of travel.|$|E
5|$|Colbung {{continued}} {{to press for}} the exhumation, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan's death on 11 July, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration. His request was not met, and {{on the anniversary of}} Yagan's death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.|$|E

50|$|On {{or before}} April 10, Bundy asked the Oath Keepers to request that their volunteers {{who came to}} the protest follow certain rules. He <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> they not wear {{military}} camouflage and to leave their rifles in their vehicles rather than open carry them. He also <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> they check in with him when they arrived at the protest rally point. In addition, he <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> they not drive past the rally point to the Bundy ranch. Furthermore, he <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> no protester give a media interview, instead referring the media to Bundy family members, in particular him, his father, or one of his brothers.|$|R

5|$|Crowds {{gathered}} at four {{different points in}} the city, and along the route it was believed the soldiers would take in order to embark on their trains. Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe issued a proclamation, reciting the riot act and ordering the crowds to disperse, but to no effect. He later sent correspondence to the governor, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> the garrison not be taken from the city given {{the current state of}} affairs. Police commissioners ordered the closing of all barrooms and saloons.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Peter Angelos, the {{new owner}} of the Orioles, met with Armstrong and Saul Landau, who {{convinced}} him to pursue an exhibition series between his Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team. Angelos petitioned the United States Government to permit a series. United States Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen wrote to the State Department, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> the series be prevented. The United States Department of the Treasury denied Angelos' request {{on the grounds that}} American money may not be spent in Cuba under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.|$|E
5|$|In January 1893, Palmer {{approached}} the House Appropriations Committee, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> $10,000 {{of the funds}} already designated to be paid over to the Lady Managers {{by the federal government}} be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E

The mascots are the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in Lewiston and the Nezperce High School Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin called another {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in May 1861. Again, the legislators refused to call a convention to determine the state's course in the war. Instead, they approved a resolution of neutrality, and Magoffin proclaimed this position on May 20, 1861. Later that month, Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> he recognize and honor Kentucky's neutrality. In August, he sent an identical letter to President Lincoln.|$|E

Margaret returns the necklace to Mulder, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> he give it to Scully when he finds her. Margaret also says {{that she had the}} dream again about losing her daughter; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully may still be alive. A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, he looks up into the stars.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Hungarian Jews {{had already}} {{stopped by the}} time of the leak. Following publication in mid-June of parts of the Vrba-Wetzler report, describing the use of gas chambers inside Auschwitz, the Jewish Agency in Geneva had cabled London <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> Hungarian ministers be held personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted and passed to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy, who ordered an end to the deportations on 7 July.|$|E

5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage {{that had previously been}} edited out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with the}} school district <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> an edited version be used instead. Horalek, who described the passage as pornographic, said the school should have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar complaints were lodged.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} Netherlands <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books.|$|E

5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
