The album {{garnered}} critical praise as a major improvement over his first album and for revolutionizing the salsa music genre. It received a Grammy nomination, a Billboard Latin Music award, and a Lo Nuestro award. Two years later, the album made history as the first salsa disc to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Since the album's release, it has sold over 800,000 copies.|$|E

The same week, the album debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard Tropical Albums and remained in that position for five consecutive weeks. A year later, the album returned to number one on the chart, and held the position for a total of six non-consecutive weeks. It was third-best-selling tropical album of 1996 in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is <b>a</b> <b>SU</b> Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{cognitive}} radio (CR) networks, {{the ability to}} cap-ture a frequency slot for transmission in an idle channel has {{a significant impact on}} the spectrum efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of <b>a</b> secondary user (<b>SU).</b> The radio frequency (RF) front-ends of <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> have limited bandwidth for spectrum sensing with the target frequency bands dispersed in a discontinuous manner. This results in the SU having to sense multiple target frequency bands in a short period of time before selecting an appropriate idle channel for transmission. This paper addresses this technical challenge by proposing a selective opportunistic spectrum access (SOSA) scheme. With the aid of statistical data and traffic pre-diction techniques, our SOSA scheme can estimate the probability of a channel appearing idle based on the statistics and choose the best spectrum-sensing order to maximize spectrum efficiency and maintain <b>an</b> <b>SU’s</b> connection. By means of doing so, this SOSA scheme can preserve the QoS of <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> while improving the system efficiency. In contrast to previous work, we consider the practical issues encountered by <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> in <b>a</b> wireless environment, such as discontinuous target frequency bands and limited spectrum-sensing ability. We examine the spectrum-sensing scheme in terms of packet loss ratio (PLR) and throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed SOSA scheme can decrease the probability of packet losses in the discontinuous spectrum environment and improve the spectrum efficiency.

Evan Gutierrez of Allmusic gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the album {{as a step}} forward over Otra nota. He described Anthony's voice as [...] "soaring" [...] and [...] "luminescent". He cited the album as setting the bar for salsa music and closed the review by it calling the album [...] "without question {{one of the finest}} salsa records of the '90s". David Wilson of Wilson and Alroy's Record Review felt the album was an improvement from his last album, and commended the George's arrangements as [...] "varied and interesting". He referred [...] "Por Amar Se da Todo" [...] as a song that [...] "doesn't let up" [...] and [...] "Nadie Como Ella" [...] as [...] "obvious, but catchy". Of the song [...] "Y Sigues Siendo Tu", Wilson said that Anthony is [...] " [...] one of the few current male singers who can really make you believe in a sappy ballad". Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune gave the album a four-star rating and enjoyed how Anthony put a variety of sounds, including hip-hop and R, to [...] "good use". She referred to [...] "Hasta Ayer" [...] as [...] "an oldie but goodie totally transformed by soulful crooning". Billboards mentioned Anthony as [...] "grafting his muy soulful baritone onto vivid romantic narratives" [...] and acknowledged [...] "Nadie Como Ella" [...] and [...] "Se Me Sigue Olvidando" [...] as [...] "upbeat". A writer for the Village Voice penned that the tracks were [...] "nine swirling, complex dance tunes". In 2015, Billboard listed Todo <b>a</b> <b>Su</b> Tiempo as one of the Essential Latin Albums of Past 50 Year stating that the album [...] "launched Anthony to fame as an instant salsa superstar and it wasn't long before he was a household name".|$|E

50|$|The {{beauty of}} the SU lies in its {{simplicity}} and lack of multiple jets and ease of adjustment. Adjustment is accomplished by altering the starting position of the jet relative to the needle on a fine screw (26TPI for most pre-HIF versions). At first sight, the principle appears to bear a similarity {{to that of the}} slide carburettor, which was previously used on many motorcycles. The slide carburettor has the same piston and main needle as <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> carburettor, however the piston/needle position is directly actuated by a physical connection to the throttle cable rather than indirectly by venturi airflow as with <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> carburettor. This piston actuation difference is the significant distinction between a slide and <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> carburettor. The piston in a slide carburettor is controlled by the operator's demands rather than the demands of the engine. This means that the metering of the fuel can be inaccurate unless the vehicle is travelling at a constant speed at a constant throttle setting - conditions rarely encountered except on motorways. This inaccuracy results in fuel waste, particularly as the carburettor must be set slightly rich to avoid a lean condition (which can cause engine damage). For this reason Japanese motorcycle manufacturers ceased to fit slide carbs and substituted constant-depression carbs, which are essentially miniature SUs. It is also possible - indeed, easy - to retrofit <b>an</b> <b>SU</b> carburettor to <b>a</b> bike that was originally manufactured with a slide carburettor, and obtain improved fuel economy and more tractable low-speed behaviour.|$|R
