The 2.3L engine, named Dura-built 140, received improved cooling and durability refinements, and a five years/60,000 mile warranty. The chassis received the new Pontiac Sunbird's upgraded components including the box-section front cross-member, larger rear brakes and torque-arm rear suspension, replacing the four-link design, and effectively eliminating wheel-hop on rough roads.

2500|$|The new {{terminal}} was opened on 7 October 2005 by the Prime Minister John Howard and South Australian Premier Mike Rann. However, Adelaide Airport Limited announced soon afterward that only international flights {{would use the}} new facility immediately due to problems with the fuel pumps and underground pipes. These problems related initially to the <b>anti-rusting</b> agent applied to the insides of the fuel pumps, then to construction debris in the pipes. Although international and regional (from December 2005) aircraft were refuelled via tankers, a lack of space and safety concerns prevented this action for domestic jet aircraft, which instead continued operations at the old terminal. The re-fueling system was cleared of all debris and the {{new terminal}} was used for all flights from 17 February 2006. The new airport terminal is approximately [...] end to end and is capable of handling 27 aircraft, including an Airbus A380, simultaneously and processing 3,000 passengers per hour. It includes high-amenity public and airline lounges, 14 glass-sided aerobridges, 42 common user check-in desks and 34 shop fronts. Free wireless Internet is also provided throughout the terminal by Internode Systems, a first for an Australian airport.|$|R
2500|$|A 1976 {{facelift}} included wider grill, tri-color {{tail lamps}} and extensive body <b>anti-rust</b> improvements.

In November 1975, it had been decided to discontinue the car after the 1976 model year. Total production of 3,508 cars ended in July 1976 with a Medium Saddle Metallic model delivered to a Cleveland, Ohio dealer. 190,321 Vega hatchback coupes were produced in the same period.|$|E
2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes. Improved technology {{has seen the}} creation of vented rotors for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid heat fade on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its <b>anti-rust</b> properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad {{into contact with the}} disc.

Petroleum-based rust-inhibitors provide several benefits, including the ability to creep over metal, covering missed areas. Additionally, a petroleum, solvent-free rust inhibitor remains on the metal surface, sealing it from rust-accelerating water and oxygen. Other benefits of petroleum-based rust protection include the self-healing properties that come naturally to oils, which helps undercoatings to resist abrasion caused by road sand and other debris. The disadvantage of using a petroleum-based coating is the film left over on surfaces, rendering these products too messy for top side exterior application, and unsafe in areas where it can be slipped on. They also cannot be painted.|$|E

5000|$|Colors and {{treatments}} {{applied to the}} panels from the factory should be considered.

The {{surface coating}} of {{insulation}} resistance {{is one of}} the key technical indexes of electrical steel sheet, and one of the important parameters of the products of electrical steel sheet. Nowadays the surface coating of insulation resistance device is relatively heavy, measurement error is relatively large, and measurement repeatability is not good. To solve these problems, we design an insulation resistance measurement system based on Infineon XE 166 microcontroller. This article analyzes the measuring principle of silicon steel coating surface insulation resistance and includes the three aspects of mechanical, circuit and software. The experimental results validate the feasibility of this system. The measurement system is stable and reliable, high repetition rate, and has a good application prospect. The coating is very important to the quality of silicon steel sheet.
