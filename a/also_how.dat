5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but <b>also</b> <b>how</b> this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E
5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is <b>also</b> <b>how</b> his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} {{relationship between}} creativity and intelligence {{has been of}} interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels & Jackson, Barron, Wallach & Kogan, and Guilford – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence.

25|$|The {{study of}} Boolean algebras and group {{theory in the}} 19th century proved correct Leibniz's intuition that {{algebraic}} methods {{could be used to}} reason about qualitative and non-numerical phenomena. Specifically, the members of the universal set of a Boolean algebra or group need not be numbers. Moreover, a fair bit of philosophy and theoretical science can be formalized as axiomatic theories embodying first-order logic and set theory. Note <b>also</b> <b>how</b> model theory has been employed to formalize and reason about such emphatically nonnumerical subjects as semantics and pragmatics of natural languages. But these approaches have yet to result in any pictographic notations.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{population-based}} {{health management}} is complex, requiring a multiple {{set of skills}} (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but <b>also</b> <b>how</b> a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the judges}} commands, {{the dog and}} handler team walks a {{predetermined}} pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side and reasonably close and attentive to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit when the judge instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a heeling pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. Heeling {{is one of the}} most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is <b>also</b> <b>how</b> most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises.|$|E

Other applications include traffic flow (see Wardrop's principle), how to organize auctions (see auction theory), the outcome of efforts exerted by multiple parties in the education process, regulatory legislation such as environmental regulations (see tragedy of the Commons), natural resource management, analysing strategies in marketing, and even penalty kicks in football (see matching pennies).|$|E

25|$|Einem's defence team (now {{consisting}} of barrister David Peek with assistance from Helena Jasinski) appealed the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia and requested {{that a new}} trial be set. The basis for this appeal was the evidence given about Kelvin's heterosexuality, the references to Einem's own homosexuality through the trial and the negative impact that might have had on the jury, and <b>also</b> <b>how</b> Mr. Justice White in his summation did not include reference to the testimony given by Einem's relative about his attendance at the birthday party on the day Kelvin's body was dumped. The Court of Criminal of Appeal rejected the appeal, saying that the trial was conducted fairly and just throughout, however they did concede that Mr. Justice White should have included the evidence relating to the birthday party.|$|E
25|$|Even {{at the age}} {{of seven}} when the family moved to Lichfield, she {{recognised}} she had a gift for writing. At Lichfield the family lived in the Bishop's Palace which became the centre of a literary circle including Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, to which Anna was exposed and encouraged to participate as she later relates. Though Canon Seward's (but not his wife's) attitudes towards the education of girls was progressive relative to the times, they were not excessively liberal. Amongst the subjects he taught them was theology and numeracy, and how to read and appreciate poetry, and <b>also</b> <b>how</b> to write and recite poetry. Although this deviated from what were considered ' conventional drawing room accomplishments', the omissions were also notable, including languages and science, although they were left free to pursue their own inclinations. However Anna was not unskilled in the domestic sphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the ripening process cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of the grapevine but <b>also</b> <b>how</b> the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that the grapevine can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, but too much leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as bunch rot and powdery mildew which can hamper the ripening process. A very vigorous vine with many clusters and vine shoots will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and vine shoots on the vine but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the ripening process.|$|E
