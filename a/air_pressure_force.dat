40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a hybrid type of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microgripper integrated with an electrostatic mechanism and vacuum technology. Vacuum tools are integrated in this microgripper {{in order to}} achieve a reliable and accurate manipulation of microobjects. The microgripper is fabricated by a surface and bulk micromachining technology. The pick and release micromanipulation of microobjects is accomplished by electrostatic driving force caused by comb structure and an auxiliary <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> from air pump. The performance of this new hybrid type of microgripper is experimentally demonstrated through the manipulation of 100 – 200 µm polystyrene balls. Experimental results show that this microgripper can successfully fulfill the pick and release micromanipulation...|$|E
40|$|Smoothed {{particle}} hydrodynamics (SPH) is efficient, mass preserving, {{and flexible}} in handling topological changes. However, small-scale thin features {{are difficult to}} simulate in SPH-based free surface flows, due {{to a number of}} robustness and stability issues. In this paper, we address this problem from two perspectives: the robustness of surface forces and the numerical instability of thin features. We present a new surface tension force scheme based on a free surface energy functional, under the diffuse interface model. We develop an efficient way to calculate the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> for free surface flows, without using air particles. Compared with previous surface force formulae, our formulae are more robust against particle sparsity in thin feature cases. To avoid numerical instability on thin features, we propose to adjust the internal pressure force by estimating the internal pressure at two scales and filtering the force using a geometry-aware anisotropic kernel. Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling a variety of small-scale thin liquid features, including thin sheets, thin jets, and water splashes...|$|E

Available field measurement data are collected {{to investigate this}} event, numerical model is setup to reproduce this unknown waves. We found several 1 -min interval tidal elevation and sea level pressure (SLP) data along the western coast of Korea and analyzed it using wavelet technique. The wavelet power spectrum for sea water level anomalies is computed using the Morlet mother function. The high wave energy is occurred between 8 and 16 minutes during 0 ??? 2 KST 31 March 2007, and the sudden pressure jump of 3 ??? 5 hPa occurred simultaneously with high wave energy event. The numerical experiments of the abnormal wave were performed using 2 -dimensional shallow water wave model (COMCOT), and <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>forcing</b> is made from the variation of SLP field and pressure jump from weather charts.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the use of}} a cyclostationary blind source separation algorithm (namely RRCR) to extract angle deterministic signals from mechanical rotating machines in presence of stationary speed fluctuations. This means that only phase fluctuations while machine is running in steady-state conditions are considered while run-up or run-down speed variations are not taken into account. The machine is also supposed to run in idle conditions so non-stationary phenomena due to the load are not considered. It is theoretically assessed that in such operating conditions the deterministic (periodic) signal in the angle domain becomes cyclostationary at first and second orders in the time domain. This fact justifies the use of the RRCR algorithm, which is able to directly extract the angle deterministic signal from the time domain without performing any kind of interpolation. This is particularly valuable when angular resampling fails because of uncontrolled speed fluctuations. The capability of the proposed approach is verified by means of simulated and actual vibration signals captured on a pneumatic screwdriver handle. In this particular case not only the extraction of the angle deterministic part can be performed but also the separation of the main sources of excitation (i. e. motor shaft imbalance, epyciloidal gear meshing and <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>forces)</b> affecting the user hand during operations...|$|R
5000|$|The Quick Dump Valve is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choices of valves for spudding.

The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> then <b>forces</b> the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no pilot pressure, the valve snaps open with no pilot pressure to hinder it.

This filtration method was mainly designed to increase the filtration rate during the drainage cycle and, hence, produce drier filter cakes, which in turn could reduce the cost and emission problems/concerns of thermal dryers in the preparation plants. Several dewatering parameters, including applied <b>pressure,</b> centrifugal <b>force</b> (G-force), spin time, cake thickness, and surface hydrophobization, were tested to optimize the processing conditions. Test results showed that, at higher <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> and centrifugal <b>force,</b> the cake moisture reduction was more than 70 %, depending on the testing conditions. As a result, it can be-concluded that the novel filtration method effectively works on the dewatering of fine particles (– 150 [*]μm) ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{balloons}} have {{a certain}} elasticity to them {{that needs to be}} taken into account. The act of stretching a balloon fills it with potential energy. When it is released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and the balloon snaps back into its original position, though perhaps a little stretched out. When a balloon is filled with air, the balloon is being stretched. While the elasticity of the balloon causes tension that would have the balloon collapse, it is also being pushed back out by the constant bouncing of the internal air molecules. The internal air has to exert force not only to counteract the external air to keep the <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> [...] "even", but it also has to counteract the natural contraction of the balloon. Therefore, it requires more <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> (or <b>force)</b> than the air outside the balloon wall. Because of this, when helium balloons are left and they float higher, as atmospheric <b>pressure</b> decreases, the <b>air</b> inside it exerts more pressure than outside it so the balloon pops from tension. In some cases, the helium leaks out from pores and the balloon deflates, falling down.|$|R
