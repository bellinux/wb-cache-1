In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide.

25|$|There {{is an easy}} {{numerical}} way {{to identify}} Nash equilibria on <b>a</b> <b>payoff</b> matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule {{does not apply to}} the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in the payoff pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum of the row of the cell - then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|For many {{classes of}} options, {{traditional}} valuation techniques are intractable {{because of the}} complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in <b>a</b> <b>payoff</b> for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option.

Smith and Miller received <b>a</b> <b>payoff</b> of {{almost half a}} million dollars for getting a German-owned firm, the American Metal Company, released to new U.S. owners.

Miller and Daugherty were indicted for defrauding the government. The first trial, in September 1926, resulted in a hung jury; at the second, early in 1927, Miller was convicted and served prison time, but the jury again hung as to Daugherty. Though charges against Daugherty were then dropped, and he was never convicted of any offense, his refusal to take the stand in his own defense devastated what was left of his reputation.

500|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, Žigić {{was close}} to a return to Spain with Real Mallorca.

He began the playing season on the bench, coming off it after 85 minutes to produce a 94th-minute equaliser at home to Charlton Athletic on the opening day, and was used more as substitute than starter by new manager Lee Clark, who preferred Peter Løvenkrands or Leroy Lita. On the eve of the January transfer window, chief executive Peter Pannu confirmed that player sales were necessary to stave off the risk of administration. Even if the club could raise as much as £6M from the sale of England goalkeeper Jack Butland, Žigić's wages were more than the club could afford, and the player needed [...] "to go out and showcase himself."

Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the [...] "more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked [...] "because the stories are being told with such passion."

3000|$|Assume {{we are in}} a subgame perfect equilibrium. Each {{bookmaker}} k∈ K {{can assure}} <b>a</b> final <b>payoff</b> of at least zero by setting π ^H_k = π ^A_k = 1. Hence, no bookmaker receives <b>a</b> negative <b>payoff.</b> We will prove that each bookmaker receives zero. Assume, on the contrary, that there exists some bookmaker with <b>a</b> positive final <b>payoff.</b> W.l.o.g., we take 1 ∈ K and u_ 1 > 0. Let π ^H_ = [...] _k∈ Kπ ^H_k and π ^A_ = [...] _k∈ Kπ ^A_k. Taking into account the optimal strategy of the bettors, any k∈ K with π ^H_k > π ^H_ implies h_k = 0. Analogously, π ^A_k > π ^A_ implies a_k = 0. Since bookmaker 1 gets <b>a</b> positive <b>payoff,</b> we deduce that either π ^H_ 1 = π ^H_ or π ^A_ 1 = π ^A_ or both. Any other bookmaker k∈ K∖{ 1 } with u_k = 0 would find it profitable to change her bets to π ^A_k = π ^A_ 1 - ϵ and π ^H_k = π ^H_ 1 - ϵ, for ϵ small enough, in order to get <b>a</b> positive <b>payoff.</b> Hence, u_k > 0 for all k∈ K, which implies h_k+a_k > 0 for all k∈ K.

For for ϵ small enough, this payoff is strictly larger than u_ 1. This contradiction shows that no bookmaker can get <b>a</b> positive <b>payoff.</b> On the other hand, for any k∈ K, there exists l∈ K∖{k} with h_l + a_l > 0, because otherwise bookmaker k would get <b>a</b> positive <b>payoff</b> by setting monopolistic odds.|$|R
