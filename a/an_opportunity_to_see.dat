Tourism activity is only allowed in selected areas of Corbett Tiger Reserve so that people get <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its splendid landscape and the diverse wildlife. In recent years {{the number of people}} coming here has increased dramatically. Presently, every season more than 70,000 visitors come to the park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely had <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, {{which had to be}} thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E

25|$|Mystery guests {{would usually}} {{attempt to conceal}} their identities with {{disguised}} voices, much to the amusement of the studio audience. According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were about to open. On those occasions, to provide the audience <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the guest play the game, the cast would typically allow questioning to pass around at least once before coming up with the correct guess.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known movie featuring some exterior scenes {{filmed in}} the city is On the Night of the Fire (1939), though by and large the action is studio-bound. Later came The Clouded Yellow (1951) and Payroll (1961), both of which feature more extensive scenes filmed {{in the city}}. The gangster thriller Get Carter (1971) was shot on location in and around Newcastle and offers <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what Newcastle looked like in the early 1970s. The city was also backdrop to another gangster film, the film noir Stormy Monday (1988), directed by Mike Figgis and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting and Sean Bean.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1928, with October still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, {{accompanied}} by his perennial film collaborator Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the famous Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union. He {{spent the next two}} years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zürich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tissé entitled Frauennot - Frauenglück.|$|E
50|$|The plot {{is quite}} notable by the {{striking}} leadership {{qualities of the}} Maureen O'Hara role. Released in 1955, late in the epoch of this style of historical adventure there are some playful subtleties, <b>a</b> touching <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the 69-year-old McLaglen in a competent action role, and a very striking example of an archery 'trick-shot'.|$|R
50|$|Victory is a {{surviving}} 1919 American drama film {{directed by}} Maurice Tourneur, starring Jack Holt, Seena Owen, Lon Chaney, and Wallace Beery.

50|$|For 2012 {{the route}} was altered to two laps of the Maidenhead/Cookham {{half of the}} route, staying north of the A4 throughout. Although less picturesque, this reduced {{congestion}} at the start and gave spectators <b>a</b> better <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the action. The amended route was voted in 4th place for PB potential in the Runner's World Races of the Year 2012 Awards.|$|R
25|$|I {{understand}} {{the reorganization of}} the Lake Shore has been affected upon favorable terms, but have never had <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the plan. I would every strongly recommend the purchase or least of the western divisions of the system, if favorable terms may be obtained. I would also advise {{the purchase of the}} Spokane Branch, if the property could be acquired upon satisfactory terms, which in my opinion would be based upon the value of that portion of the line within the city limits over which the Great Northern now gains access, including any liens the bonds may constitute upon the depot property, and the salvage value of the rails upon the remaining portion of the branch.|$|E
25|$|Billy {{gave the}} many fans of Crawford's {{portrayal}} of Frank Spencer <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{him in a}} broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em, Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in Flowers for Algernon (1979) {{in the role of}} Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on a very short-lived ITV sitcom, Chalk and Cheese, as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go over well with his fans: the popularity of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat typecast, {{to the extent that they}} could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.|$|E
25|$|In mid-December, Colonel Breytenbach's brother Cloete, a {{journalist}} for The Sunday Times, arrived in South West Africa to {{do a story}} on the war. He requested <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the operational area and was permitted to photograph 32 Battalion in action as long as he refrained from publishing the unit's name or any details of its deployment. Cloete received his opportunity on 23 December, when an SADF supply convoy spotted suspicious tracks entering Ovamboland. A 32 Battalion member, Tony Viera, followed the tracks two kilometres into Angola and observed seven insurgents mingling with civilians north of Chapa Lupale. His platoon deployed around the fringe of the settlement and crawled to within seventy metres of the guerrillas. In the ensuing firefight six of the seven were shot dead. Cloete Breytenbach published an exclusive report on the action when he returned to Johannesburg. This {{was the first time that}} 32 Battalion had been publicly photographed.|$|E
50|$|Dorm sings are {{events in}} which AVP, often with other a cappella {{groups at the}} University of Virginia, get {{together}} and travel to the two main areas of freshman dorms to perform.

25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

500|$|Many {{journalists who}} saw the film at Sundance speculated that it was likely that Disney would take legal action to prevent the film from being shown outside the festival, or perhaps even during it. [...] "Disney's lawyers are {{probably}} climbing onto helicopters and planning a raid on Park City right now," [...] wrote McWeeny. Critics urged others present to see it {{before it was too}} late, and commented that it was questionable if those not present at the festival would ever have <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|E

500|$|James Charney {{notes in}} his review of the book for Library Journal, [...] "Questions of {{effectiveness}} or possible harm are hardly considered." [...] Charney characterizes {{the problem of the}} book and its subject matter as a [...] "kind of with-it diffuseness which disallows any intelligent understanding on principle". In a review of the book for The New York Times Book Review, Zane Berzins was critical of the work, commenting: [...] "There isn't much to be said for the book except that it exudes a kind of repellent fascination." [...] A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews was negative; the review characterizes it as, [...] "Not a book, really. A verbatim transcription of one of Werner Erhard's weekend sessions in $250 doublethink."
