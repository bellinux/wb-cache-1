25|$|People develop {{specific}} fears as {{a result}} of learning. This has been studied in psychology as fear conditioning, beginning with John B. Watson's Little Albert experiment in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a ball of cotton.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the novel centres around Nick Dunne and his wife Amy's marriage. It {{alternates}} point of view between Nick and Amy, with Nick describing their relationship in the present day and Amy's diary entries depicting their relationship in the past. Their perspectives on their marriage are very different - Amy's diary portrays Nick as an aggressive, moody, idle and threatening husband while Nick describes Amy as someone who is needlessly difficult, anti-social, stubborn, and <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> perfectionist.|$|E
50|$|Lagrange {{proved the}} {{converse}} of Euler's theorem: if x is <b>a</b> quadratic <b>irrational,</b> then the regular continued fraction expansion of x is periodic. Given <b>a</b> quadratic <b>irrational</b> x one can construct m different quadratic equations, each {{with the same}} discriminant, that relate the successive complete quotients of the regular continued fraction expansion of x to one another. Since there are only finitely many of these equations (the coefficients are bounded), the complete quotients (and also the partial denominators) in the regular continued fraction that represents x must eventually repeat.|$|R
40|$|Take <b>a</b> <b>irrational</b> digit walk by {{stepping}} {{in the direction}} given by each successive digit as represented in a chosen base. Compare your digit walk against <b>a</b> different <b>irrational</b> number or against the same number with different direction steps assigned to each digit. The area of the smallest enclosing rectangle for each walk is also presented. For paths with less than 100 steps the vertices along the path can be labeled with each successive digit. For fun, {{try to find the}} smallest or largest rectangle or rectangular prism that encloses the 2 D or 3 D digit walk for <b>a</b> particular <b>irrational</b> number. The "base" slider allows you to choose what base to represent the chosen irrational numbers and therefore determines the number of directions for the representation. The "number of digits" slider selects how many digits of the chosen irrational numbers to represent. If 3 D is selected so that a three-dimensional representation is presented then the " 3 D method for directions" pull-down menu allows for a choice of two ways of determining the set of possible directions in 3 D. Usually the default of "SpringEmbedding" is the best choice, but for some bases, such as 9, "SpringElectricalEmbedding" gives a better representation. When the base is less than 9 then permutations of the canonical ordering of the directions can be made with the "permutation of directions" slider...|$|R

25|$|As for irrational numbers, none of {{them have}} a finite {{representation}} in any of the rational-based positional number systems (such as the decimal and duodecimal ones); this is because a rational-based positional number system is essentially nothing but a way of expressing quantities as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of the base, and by definition no finite sum of rational numbers can ever result in <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> number. For example, 123.456 = 1 × 102 + 2 × 101 + 3 × 100 + 4 × 1/101 + 5 × 1/102 + 6 × 1/103 (this is also the reason why fractions that contain prime factors in their denominator not in common with those of the base do not have a terminating representation in that base). Moreover, the infinite series of digits of <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> number does not exhibit a strictly repeating pattern; instead, the different digits often succeed in a seemingly random fashion. The following chart compares the first few digits of the decimal and duodecimal representation of several of the most important algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers. Some of these numbers may be perceived as having fortuitous patterns, making them easier to memorize, when represented in one base or the other.|$|E
25|$|Social {{reformer}} Jeremy Bentham {{wrote the}} first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, {{at a time when}} the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy, in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings. However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.|$|E
25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one he has only {{demonstrated}} how <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as it had some appearance of credibility, not that such a position is actually held by the subjects of his study. He now turns to establishing this second point. The philosophers he is criticising not only use language in unusual ways, but do indeed also make plain language assertions of an irrationalist nature. Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E

50|$|Rather than generalising {{continued}} fractions, {{another approach}} to the problem is to generalise Minkowski's question mark function. This function ? : 1 &rarr; 1 also picks out quadratic irrational numbers since ?(x) is rational {{if and only if}} x is either rational or <b>a</b> quadratic <b>irrational</b> number, and moreover x is rational if and only if ?(x) is a dyadic rational, thus x is <b>a</b> quadratic <b>irrational</b> precisely when ?(x) is a non-dyadic rational number. Various generalisations of this function to either the unit square 1 &times; 1 or the two-dimensional simplex have been made, though none has yet solved Hermite's problem.|$|R

25|$|King Vajiravudh was a {{favor of}} literature, theater, he {{translated}} many foreign literatures into Thai. He created the spiritual {{foundation for a}} kind of Thai nationalism, a phenomenon unknown in Siam. He was based on the unity of nation, Buddhism, and kingship, and demanded loyalty from his subjects to all these three institutions. King Vajiravudh also took refuge in <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> and contradictory anti-Sinicism. As a result of the mass immigration, in contrast to previous immigration waves from China, women and entire families had also come into the country, which meant that the Chinese were less assimilated and retained their cultural independence. In an article published by King Vajiravudh under a pseudonym, he described the Chinese minority as Jews of the East.|$|E
25|$|Rocker became {{convinced}} {{that the source of}} political institutions is <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> belief in a higher authority, as Bakunin claimed in God and the State. However, Rocker rejected the Russian's rejection of theoretical propaganda and his claim that only revolutions can bring about change. Nevertheless, he was very much attracted by Bakunin's style, marked by pathos, emotion, and enthusiasm, designed to give the reader an impression of the heat of revolutionary moments. Rocker even attempted to emulate this style in his speeches, but was not very convincing. Kropotkin's anarcho-communist writings, on the other hand, were structured logically and contained an elaborate description of the future anarchist society. The work's basic premise, that an individual is entitled to receive the basic means of living from the community independently of his or her personal contributions, impressed Rocker.|$|E
25|$|Perfect fifths may be justly tuned or tempered. Two notes whose {{frequencies}} {{differ by}} {{a ratio of}} 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does {{not return to the}} original pitch class after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly detuned, or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be transposed, or played in any key on a piano or other fixed-pitch instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially keyboard and fretted) instruments today, twelve-tone equal temperament, uses <b>an</b> <b>irrational</b> multiplier, 21/12, to calculate the frequency difference of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a frequency ratio of 27/12:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.|$|E
