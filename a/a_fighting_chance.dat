He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war.

5|$|In the meantime, {{conditions}} were deteriorating on Königsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although {{safe from the}} British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally {{cut off from the}} outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her <b>a</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.|$|E

40|$|According to our {{approach}} for resolution of singularities in positive characteristic (called the Idealistic Filtration Program, alias the I. F. P. for short) the algorithm is devided {{into the following}} two steps: Step 1. Reduction of the general case to the monomial case. Step 2. Solution in the monomial case. While we have established Step 1 in arbitrary dimension, Step 2 becomes very subtle and difficult in positive characteristic. This is in clear contrast to the classical setting in characteristic zero, where the solution in the monomial case is quite easy. In dimension 3, we provided an invariant in the previous paper, inspired {{by the work of}} Benito-Villamayor, which establishes Step 2. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to approach Step 2, and provide a different invariant in dimension 3 based upon this strategy. The new invariant increases from time to time (the well-known Moh-Hauser jumping phoenomena), while it is then shown to eventually decrease. (The analysis of the jumping phoenomena and eventual decrease is done in the monomial case in our setting, while the classical analysis by Moh or Hauser is done in a different setting without any reference to the monomial case. Therefore, even though we owe most of the ideas to Moh and Hauser, our argument is carried out logically independent of their papers.) Since the old invariant in our previous paper strictly decreases after each transformation, this may look like a step backward rather than forward. However, the construction of the new invariant is more faithful to the original philosophy of Villamayor, and we believe that the new strategy has <b>a</b> better <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> in higher dimensions.

5|$|The shuttle {{returns to}} Enterprise, {{which has been}} taken over by the Gorn. Kirk and Spock space dive to {{engineering}} and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board. They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise <b>a</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>chance,</b> and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar.

However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's [...] "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that [...] "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: [...] "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm when there was <b>a</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> of victory".|$|E
50|$|Connor {{eventually}} encounters his father, but Kenway {{offers a}} cease fire, {{as he is}} also after Benjamin Church for usurping his authority. During their investigation, Kenway warns Connor that the Patriots, worried of the allegiance of the various tribes to the British, are seeking to remove Connor's people from their lands. Connor eventually hunts Lee down and kills him, taking the medallion and ending the Templar threat. He is despondent to find his tribe's village abandoned save for the Piece of Eden; through it, Juno tells him to hide the amulet. As December 21 approaches and signs of the solar flare begin to ensue, Desmond and his allies find the buried medallion, and use it at the inner Temple door, behind which is a control sphere. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him to stop it, warning that this will release Juno as an entity that may protect against the solar flare but will {{be a threat to}} mankind in the future. Juno counters, explaining that Minerva would rather have most of humanity wiped out, with Desmond safe in the Temple to emerge as a religious figure to lead the survivors but ultimately leading into conflict. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have <b>a</b> better <b>chance</b> <b>fighting</b> Juno. <b>As</b> his body is wracked by energy from the control sphere, an aurora surrounds the Earth and protects it from the solar flare.

Elysa Gardner of Rolling Stone said U2 had [...] "proven {{that the}} same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll." [...] The review said that the album, like its predecessor Rattle and Hum, was {{an attempt by the}} band to [...] "broaden its musical palette, but this time its ambitions are realized". Bill Wyman from Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "pristinely produced and surprisingly unpretentious return by one of the most impressive bands in the world". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe echoed these sentiments, stating that the album [...] "not only reinvigorates their sound, but drops any self-righteousness. The songs focus on personal relationships, not on saving the world." [...] Morse commended the album's [...] "clanging, knob-twisting sound effects" [...] and the Edge's [...] "metallic, head-snapping guitar". In the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn stated, [...] "the arty, guitar-driven textures are among the band's most confident and vigorous ever". He said the album is a difficult one for listeners because of the dark, introspective nature of the songs, which contrasts with the group's uplifting songs of the past. Jon Pareles of The New York Times lauded the record not only for featuring [...] "noisy, vertiginous arrangements", but also for the group's ability to [...] "maintain its pop skills". The review concluded, [...] "Stripped-down and defying its old formulas, U2 has given itself <b>a</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>chance</b> for the 1990s." ...|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} <b>a</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>chance?</b> We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change".
