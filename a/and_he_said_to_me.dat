2500|$|I'm quite a {{physical}} conductor. I remember seeing Adrian Boult backstage after the 1978 Proms {{and he was}} wearing a freshly ironed light blue M shirt <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> [...] "I see you're one of the sweaty ones." ...|$|E

Camp David had failed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'You should remain in Paris.' I asked him why, and he said, 'Because I am going to start an intifada. They want me to betray the Palestinian cause. They want me to give up on our principles, and I will not do so,'" [...] the {{research}} institute [...] translated Suha as saying.|$|E

2500|$|When UK pop/R group Rixton {{were asked}} which bands they had {{looked up to}} when they were younger, Jake Roche said [...] "I listened {{to a lot of}} McFly when I was growing up. I was a part of that era." [...] He {{continued}} [...] "these guys came out with instruments and they played and wrote all their own stuff and I was like, that's great – [...] I want to do that." [...] Band member Charley Bagnall agreed, saying [...] "McFly was a huge part of my life." [...] Roche's mother, English singer and TV presenter Coleen Nolan, said [...] "To me he's still that little boy I watched singing and dancing around to McFly records...I took him to their show in Manchester when he was nine or 10 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Mum, one day that will be me up there.'" [...] Other acts to cite McFly as musical influences include R5.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, the Washington Post {{reported}} evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; [...] "They said {{we will make}} you wish to die {{and it will not}} happen [...] They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, ' you. And [...] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health, you are getting out of here handicapped. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.' [...] " [...] "They ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive." [...] "I said to him, 'I believe in Allah.' So he said, 'But I believe in torture and I will torture you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Schweitzer {{continues}} {{writing in}} The Quest of the Historical Jesus {{that it is}} totally unreasonable to think that [...] "coming quickly", [...] "near", and [...] "soon" [...] could mean hundreds of years, much less, thousands {{of years in the}} future. [...] "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." [...] (Revelation 1:3) [...] "And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place." [...] "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near" [...] (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). [...] "All these things shall come upon this generation" [...] (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that the 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some shot, I'll say!" [...] {{declared}} Romer to his uncle, loftily. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{half a dozen}} times: [...] "Say, Dad, wasn't it a grand peg?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{flush left}} his cheeks almost in an instant. Some {{expression}} in my face, or some tone in my voice, of which I was not conscious, had revealed to his nervously-quickened perception more than I had intended {{that he should}} know at first. His eyes fixed themselves intently on mine; his hand grasped my arm; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in an eager whisper: ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{thought he}} was gone. His Ed was so heavy, and he knocked it so hard, and he fell so stoney, and the sassagerial {{disturbance}} in him must have been so immense, that I {{thought he was}} gone.

I love dinners: I never dine at home, except when I have company. General Faneville not only gives me dinners, but lets me always choose my own party. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the other day, [...] "Now, Lady Bellair, fix your day, and name your party."

6000|$|... 'I did not guess,' {{answered}} Siroco, 'that the son {{you have}} so long mourned {{had come back to}} you.

6000|$|... "We {{were sitting}} beside the fire. I saw you walking under the cedars. You seemed thoughtful.

He meant he'll find both God and wife for you. I don't know about that, but I say take the Indian as he thinks he is--your brother.

[...] And they sent for Roby. And I think he was right. The quantity of young officers I have seen sent rightabout in the Peninsula, because they were attended by a parcel of men who knew nothing of their constitution! Why, I might have lost my own leg once, if I had not been sharp.
