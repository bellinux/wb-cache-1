The body is washed and dressed. A le ngam ham, or chopstick, is laid between the teeth <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> rice and three coins are placed in the mouth.

2500|$|Music To Bowl By was {{recorded}} for Moon Ska Records {{in the winter}} of '89 - winter of '90. This captured the band at its pioneering stage, with emphasis on style and songwriting, unheard of in its current central valley contemporaries. (Fresno is home {{to some of the most}} influential Ska outfits of the later century, including Let's Go Bowling, as well as Kyber Rifles, Checkmate, and Los Hooligans). The band blended three-part vocals, infused with a Latin vibe inherent in its frontman/vocalist David Molina, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> Warner Bros. zaniness. David Weins acted as the MC - as the boisterous trombone playing ruffian. [...] "Music To Bowl By" [...] is considered to be a Classic in all ska circles and a credit to the genre.|$|E

6000|$|As Martin Eden {{went down}} the steps, his hand dropped into his coat pocket. It {{came out with a}} brown rice paper <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> Mexican tobacco, which were deftly rolled {{together}} into a cigarette. He drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation. [...] "By God!" [...] he said aloud, in a voice of awe and wonder. [...] "By God!" [...] he repeated. And yet again he murmured, [...] "By God!" [...] Then his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his pocket. A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern. He was only dimly aware that it was raining. He was in an ecstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.|$|E

6000|$|One of {{the stories}} of the old Wiltshire days I picked up was from an old woman, aged eighty-seven, in the Wilton workhouse. She has a vivid {{recollection}} of a labourer named Reed, in Odstock, a village on the Ebble near Salisbury, a stern, silent man, who was a marvel of strength and endurance. The work in which he most delighted was precisely that which most labourers hated, before threshing machines came in despite the action of the [...] "mobs"--threshing out corn with the flail. From earliest dawn till after dark he would sit or stand in a dim, dusty barn, monotonously pounding away, without an interval to rest, and without dinner, and with no food but a piece of bread <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> salt. Without the salt he would not eat the bread. An hour after all others had ceased from work he would put on his coat and trudge home to his wife and family.|$|E
60|$|The misfortune {{regarding}} Steele is, {{that most}} {{part of the}} company here present must take his amiability upon hearsay, and certainly can’t make his intimate acquaintance. Not that Steele was worse than his time; on the contrary, a far better, truer, and higher-hearted man than most who lived in it. But things were done in that society, and names were named, which would make you shudder now. What would be the sensation of a polite youth of the present day, if at a ball he saw the young object of his affections taking a box out of her pocket <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> snuff: or if at dinner, by the charmer’s side, she deliberately put her knife into her mouth? If she cut her mother’s throat with it, mamma would scarcely be more shocked. I allude to these peculiarities of bygone times as an excuse for my favourite, Steele, who was not worse, and often much more delicate than his neighbours.|$|E
6000|$|Then the {{impatient}} jury {{rejoined the}} main crowd, for the storm-centre of interest was there--Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle, inclosing a large vacant space {{which included the}} front exposure of {{the site of the}} late premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes; also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the [...] "lay" [...] of the place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer. Finally he said, with a stately bow: ...|$|E

6000|$|The Tribes of {{the goddess}} Danu can take all shapes, {{and those that are}} in the waters take often the shape of fish. A woman of Burren, in Galway, says, 'There are more of them in the sea than on the land, and they {{sometimes}} try to come {{over the side of the}} boat in the form of fishes, for they can take their choice shape.' At other times they are beautiful women; and another Galway woman says, 'Surely those things are in the sea as well as on land. My father was out fishing one night off Tyrone. And something came beside the boat that had eyes shining like candles. And then a wave came in, and a storm rose all in a minute, and whatever was in the wave, the weight of it had like to sink the boat. And then they saw that it was a woman in the sea that had the shining eyes. So my father went to the priest, and he bid him always to take a drop of holy water <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> salt out in the boat with him, and nothing could harm him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Never had {{the little}} rocking [...] "We're Here" [...] looked so deliciously home--like {{as when the}} cook, born and bred in fogs, rowed them back to her. There was a warm glow {{of light from the}} cabin and a {{satisfying}} smell of food forward, and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the others, all quite alive and solid, leaning over the rail and promising them a first-class pounding. But the cook was a black master of strategy. He did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more striking points of the tale, explaining as he backed and bumped round the counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck. So the boys came overside as rather uncanny heroes, and every one asked them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble. Little Penn delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions; but public opinion was against him and in favour of Long Jack, who told the most excruciating ghost-stories to nearly midnight. Under that influence no one except Salters and Penn said anything about [...] "idolatry" [...] when the cook put a lighted candle, a cake of flour and water, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> salt on a shingle, and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman quiet in case he was still restless. Dan lit the candle because he had bought the belt, and the cook grunted and muttered charms {{as long as he could}} see the ducking point of flame.|$|E

"In one minute,' he says, {{and went}} on calmly stowing the things away, and when he finished, {{he looks at me}} quite serious, and says, 'I'm obliged to you,' he says, 'and I hope you haven't ketched cold {{standing}} with your feet on them bricks and nothing much on you,' he says. 'But I want most particular to arst you not to forget to remember about that bird I giv' you,' he says. 'You call it a jackdaw, and I've no particular objection to that, only don't go and run away with the idea that it's just an or'nary jackdaw. It's a different sort, and you'll come to know its value bime-by, and that it ain't the kind of bird you can buy with a bit of bread <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> tea,' he says. 'And there's something else you've got to think of--that wife of yours. I've been sort of married myself and can feel for you,' he says. 'The time will come when that there bird's pretty little ways will amuse her, and last of all it'll make her smile, and you'll get the benefit of that,' he says. 'And you'll remember the bird was giv' to you by a man named Jones--that's my name, Jones--walking from Newcastle to Dorchester, looking for work. A poor man, you'll say, down on his luck, but not one of the common sort, not a greedy, selfish man, but a man that's always trying to do something to make others happy,' he says.|$|E
