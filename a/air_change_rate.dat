Natural ventilation {{is the most}} effective measure to reduce the cooling energy consumption, but it is quite difficult to control and quantitatively assess the natural ventilation. A method was developed with coupling simulation by both software of DeST-h and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in typical meteorological year (TMY) in Guangzhou. First, the base room temperatures with different <b>air</b> <b>change</b> (ACH) <b>rates</b> of natural ventilated dwelling were simulated with DeST-h. The time period in that the indoor air temperature could meet thermal comfort requirement only by natural ventilation in occupied period was analyzed, in which the wind speed and direction in TMY was obtained for the ventilation environment simulation of rooms in windows and doors switching with the PHOENICS software. The actual <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rates</b> in different rooms in such wind speed and direction were calculated. Also the cooling loads of building in the actual <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rates</b> were simulated with intermittent air conditioning. The air conditioning system operated when the base room temperature was higher than 29 ℃. Rate of cooling loads reduction was calculated by comparing the result to the baseline, which were the cooling loads of building with 1 ACH. The actual <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rates</b> show that the energy saving effect of natural ventilation was influenced by the windows and doors switching. 61 ~ 71. 37 % of the natural ventilation potential was used in the rooms with windows and doors opened, and 14. 06 ~ 82. 54 % of the natural ventilation potential was used in the rooms with windows opened and doors closed.

5000|$|Night {{flushing}} (also {{known as}} night ventilation, night cooling, night purging, or nocturnal convective cooling) is a passive or semi-passive cooling strategy that requires increased air movement {{at night to}} cool the structural elements of a building. Unlike free cooling, which assists in chilling water, night flushing cools down the thermal mass. To execute night flushing, the building envelope typically stays closed during the day, causing excess heat gains to be stored in the building's thermal mass. The building structure acts as a sink through the day and absorbs heat gains from occupants, equipment, solar radiation, and conduction through walls, roofs, and ceilings. At night, when the outside air is cooler and not too humid, the envelope is opened, allowing cooler air {{to pass through the}} building so the stored heat can be dissipated by convection. This process reduces the temperature of the indoor air and of the building's thermal mass, allowing convective, conductive, and radiant cooling to take place during the day when the building is occupied. Night flushing is most effective in climates with a large diurnal swing, i.e. a large difference between the daily maximum and minimum outdoor temperature. For optimal performance, the nighttime outdoor air temperature should fall below the daytime comfort zone limits of 22 C and 60% relative humidity. For the night flushing strategy to be effective at reducing indoor temperature and energy usage, the thermal mass must be sized sufficiently and distributed over a wide enough surface area to absorb the space's daily heat gains. Also, the total <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate</b> must be high enough to remove the internal heat gains from the space at night.There are three ways night flushing can be achieved in a building: ...|$|E

40|$|Results {{from studies}} of air quality in {{buildings}} are often difficult to interpret and evaluate and, {{in order to avoid}} erroneous conclusions, special evaluating tools may be needed. Modelling in various forms {{can be used as a}} method of evaluating measured values from such investigations. This thesis discusses modelling of gaseous pollutant concentrations in indoor air with the focus on identification of the sources of the pollutants. The results are mainly obtained by field measurements and the data are analysed by use of a mass balance equation. One of the basic requirements for using the method described, is that continuously monitored concentration values are available from measurements obtained, for both supply air and exhaust air of the room or building studied. Modelling applied to continuosly monitored concentration values can reveal whether the pollutants originate outdoors or indoors. The strength of the indoor pollutant source or sink can also be determined. The modelling described can be applied at the design stage of a building in order to calculate the ventilation rate required to overcome the concentration of gaseous pollutants. The effect of different ventilation strategies, for example airflow rate control, can also be investigated in this way. It is essential to have knowledge about the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate</b> when investigating the indoor air quality. The <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate</b> of a room or a building can be determined in several ways. A new method is suggested for determining the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate,</b> which unlike conventional tracer gas methods does not require the supply of an additional tracer gas. Instead, the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate</b> is determined by measuring the normal CO concentration in both the supply air and the exhaust air, thereby eliminating the necessity for further measurements. The calculated exhaust air concentration values of CO are compared to the measured values for various air change rates. The <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate</b> that gives the best correlation between calculated and measured values provides a good estimate of the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rate.</b> The modelling described in the thesis has proved to be a useful tool when evaluating field measurements of pollutant concentrations in indoor air.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{transmission}} of infectious airborne disease have focused on patient room <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides pathogen dilution and removal. The logical but mostly unproven premise is that greater <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rates</b> reduce the concentration of infectious particles and thus, the probability of airborne disease transmission. Recently, {{a growing body of}} research suggests pathways between pathogenic source (patient) and control (exhaust) may be the dominant environmental factor. While increases in airborne disease transmission have been associated with ventilation rates below 2 ACH, comparatively less data are available to quantify the benefits of higher <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rates</b> in clinical spaces. As a result, a series of tests were conducted in an actual hospital to observe the containment and removal of respirable aerosols (0. 5 – 10 μm) with respect to ventilation rate and directional airflow in a general patient room, and, an airborne infectious isolation room. Higher ventilation rates were not found to be proportionately effective in reducing aerosol concentrations. Specifically, increasing mechanical ventilation from 2. 5 to 5. 5 ACH reduced aerosol concentrations only 30 % on average. However, particle concentrations were more than 40 % higher in pathways between the source and exhaust as was the suspension and migration of larger particles (3 – 10 μm) throughout the patient room(s).

This paper applies Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD to study wind-induced airflow in the narrow (23 mm) ventilated facade cavities of an isolated low-rise building. Both coupled and decoupled simulations are performed. In the coupled simulations, the atmospheric boundary layer wind-flow pattern around the building and the resulting airflow in the cavities are calculated simultaneously and within the same computational domain. In the decoupled simulations, two separate CFD simulations are conducted: a simulation of the outdoor wind flow around the building (with closed cavities) to determine the surface pressures at the position of the cavity inlet and outlet openings, and a simulation of the cavity airflow, driven by these surface pressures. CFD validation is performed for the external and internal (cavity) flows. It indicates an important modelling limitation: while both laminar and turbulent cavity airflow can be accurately reproduced with low-Reynolds number modelling, this method fails in the transitional regime. The valid CFD results (outside the transitional regime) are analysed in terms of cavity airflow patterns and cavity <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>rates</b> per hour (ACH) for different cavity positions, wind speeds and wind directions. The CFD results of cavity air speed and ACH compare favourably with values from previous experimental studies.
