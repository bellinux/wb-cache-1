5|$|Gorgosaurus {{lived in}} <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> {{floodplain}} environment {{along the edge}} of an inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs. In some areas, Gorgosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Daspletosaurus. Although these animals were roughly the same size, there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its ontogeny, life history and other aspects of its biology.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the runways, parking ramp and other {{features}} of Tamiami Airport were still visible on campus and clearly discernible in aerial photos. Construction has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past. University Park is <b>a</b> <b>lush,</b> heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and a 15-acre nature preserve, {{as well as a}} palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.|$|E

5|$|As {{their journey}} continues, the Kushan fleet gives {{sanctuary}} to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion {{to distract the}} Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led by the Taiidan emperor. During the final battle, the emperor manages to knock S'jet into a coma, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> world {{in contrast to the}} desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, the awakened Karan insists to be the last one to set foot on the planet.|$|E
5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E
5|$|Green Hill is {{the first}} level of Sonic the Hedgehog. Located on South Island, it is <b>a</b> <b>lush,</b> grassy stage with unique {{features}} like droopy palm trees and crumbling cliffs. In addition, as with later levels in the game, Green Hill has environmental features and obstacles like ramps, vertical loops, tunnels, spring-boards, spikes, and checkpoints. It is normally populated by woodland creatures, but antagonist Doctor Eggman imprisons them inside robots known as Badniks prior {{to the events of}} the game, so the player must destroy them to free the animals. Green Hill consists of three acts, and the end of Act 3 features a boss battle with Eggman. After beating Eggman, Sonic moves on to the second level, the lava-themed Marble Zone.|$|E

5|$|Beyond Loch Snizort to {{the west}} of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish is {{separated}} from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of Isay. The loch is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 295metres (967ft) at Waterstein Head. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands. Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.|$|E

5000|$|Vanderklippe {{reported}} that the men had never felt they could {{fit in with the}} Palauans. [...] Some of the men compared Palau with <b>a</b> <b>lusher,</b> larger Guantanamo. Some of the men were able to bring their wives to Palau. Attempts to hold most regular jobs failed, due to cultural differences. Attempts to use their traditional leather-working skills to be self-employed failed. Eventually, all six men were employed as night-time security guards, a job that did not require interaction with Palauans.|$|R

25|$|The Griffins’ also capitalised on an {{emerging}} theme within the new colony which recognised the bush, {{referring to the}} country's extensive native vegetation, as a national identity. Critical {{to the success of}} the Griffins’ design was their use of gold and sepia which contrasted other entries that depicted <b>a</b> <b>lush,</b> green capital. The Griffins’ approach better represented Australia's unique conditions and, more importantly, celebrated them.|$|E
25|$|Then came a famine {{because of}} bad weather, this perhaps being an allegory {{having to do with}} Snow as a personification. Because of the lack of grain, Snow forbade making strong drink from grain and ordered {{abstinence}} from drinking alcohol on pain of death. Saxo follows with a tale of <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> who saved himself from death with clever excuses and finally convinced Snow to rescind those laws.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{internal}} tensions, Segel left the band during rehearsals for their fifth full-length record. [...] Written mostly as a four-piece, the resultant LP, Key Lime Pie, featured the violin playing of Don Lax before {{the replacement of}} violinist Morgan Fichter (of the Bay Area band Harm Farm) was found. Fichter played violin on two tracks. The album featured a noticeably darker lyrical outlook {{as compared to the}} band's previous records. Musically, it featured less of the world-music influences of the previous albums, replaced with more elements of Americana, along with <b>a</b> <b>lusher,</b> <b>a</b> more orchestrated version of psychedelia than their previous records had featured. They scored a minor hit with a cover of the Status Quo song [...] "Pictures of Matchstick Men", their highest-charting single.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>Lush</b> had expected, it was {{addressed}} to Miss Harleth, Offendene. When his irritation had cooled down he was glad {{there had been no}} explosive quarrel; but he felt sure that there was a notch made against him, and that somehow or other he was intended to pay. It was also clear to him that the immediate effect of his revelation had been to harden Grandcourt's previous determination. But as to the particular movements that made this process in his baffling mind, Lush could only toss up his chin in despair of a theory.|$|R
25|$|Larger scale works {{included}} his orchestral piece Iberia (1907), a triptych {{medley of}} Spanish allusions and fleeting impressions which was begun {{as a work}} for two pianos, and also the music for Gabriele D'Annunzio's mystery play Le Martyre de saint Sébastien (1911). <b>A</b> <b>lush</b> and dramatic work, written in only two months, it is remarkable in sustaining a late antique modal atmosphere that was otherwise touched only in relatively short piano pieces.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Oscar I, there was a renewed {{interest}} for older styles and when the Vita Havet (the White Sea Ballroom) was created from the designs of Per Axel Nyström in 1844–1850, a compromise between old and new was made. Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander was the royal curator of King Charles XV and shared his taste in interior design, this resulted in rooms like the Victoriasalongen (the Victoria Drawing room) in <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> revived Rococo style.|$|E
25|$|Managua, {{due to its}} {{tropical}} climate, varied topography, naturally fertile soils, {{and abundant}} rain and water sources, boasts {{a great variety of}} flora.

During the rainy season (May to November), Managua becomes <b>a</b> <b>lush</b> city due to many palms, bushes, and other plants and trees which dominate the city's appearance.|$|E
