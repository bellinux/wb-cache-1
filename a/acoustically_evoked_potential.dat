The subject may feel sensations of unsteadiness, imbalance or vertigo, associated with disturbances of oculomotor and postural control. Tullio's phenomenon is provoked by very loud sound and should be considered physiological. It is pathological if it is provoked by normal sounds. Changes to the functioning and/or the morphology of the labyrinth should be looked for in patients with the pathological form: decreased thresholds for the <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> vestibular <b>potentials,</b> semicircular canal dehiscence, traumatic lesions of the labyrinth, ligament hyperlaxity...|$|R

40|$|The {{advantages}} of binaural versus unilateral hearing consist primarily of {{the capacity for}} directional hearing and better speech comprehension with background noise. For patients with hearing loss the goal of treatment is always an improvement in hearing in both ears. For patients with bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss this {{can be achieved by}} a cochlear implant. Since this is an invasive and very cost-intensive method, a reliable indication is of great importance. In addition to the detection of electric stimulation of the auditory nerve and the assessment of binaural fusion ability, with bilateral implantation other anamnestic factors such as age and duration of deafness may play an important role. In the present work, the prerequisites for azimuth perception due to interaural time and level differences were examined. It was shown that a sensory hearing loss as opposed to a retrocochlear disorder does not call into question lateralization capability. The individual interaural fusion ability can be estimated using the binaural interaction components extracted from the EEG. Previously only a subjective test was available to test electrical auditory nerve stimulation, which requires concentrated patient compliance. A noninvasive, objective auditory nerve function test was developed, whose significance could be confirmed by comparison with an established applicable auditory nerve test procedure. The study of CI (Cochlear Implant) -supplied patients showed, in addition to an improvement in speech comprehension, a significant improvement in quality of life. The benefit of the CI extended also to social and psychological areas and was in part independent {{of the results of the}} speech tests. The duration of deafness had a significant influence on speech comprehension with CI. Also, the assessment of cortical <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> triggered by the CI underlines the importance of early CI supply and seems suitable for the objective post-surgical evaluation of the success of the implant. Expanded indication criteria and combined forms of stimulation will require in the future the development of diagnostic procedures with the goal of greater certainty in indications and prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Vestibular <b>evoked</b> myogenic <b>potentials</b> and <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> short latency {{negative}} response are two non-cochlear responses with probably saccular origin. The {{present study}} was conducted to determine the percentage of presence and the relation between these two responses in children with hearing loss. Methods: Thirty children with profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss were studied Vestibular <b>evoked</b> myogenic <b>potentials</b> ellicitedby tone burst stimuli and <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> short latency negative response ellicited by click stimuli were recorded. Both responses were recorded at air conduction threshold level monaurally via an internal receiver. Results: Vestibular <b>evoked</b> myogenic <b>potentials</b> in 53. 3 % of children and <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> short latency negative response in 40. 0 % of cases were recorded. There was a significant correlation between the percentage of recording these two responses (p= 0. 005). Gender and the stimulated ear had no effect on the results. Conclusion: In almost half of these disabled children, both vestibular <b>evoked</b> myogenic <b>potentials</b> and <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> short latency negative response were recoreded. This finding may both indicate that hearing loss has no effect on the function of otolith organs in some children and vestibular deficits probably exist along with hearing impairment in others.

This version is reproduced {{with the permission}} of the publisher. Speech processing strategies based on high rate electrical stimulation have been associated with recent improvements of speech perception among cochlear implant users. In the present study we investigated the effects of chronic monopolar stimulation using very high rates (14493 pulses). Under general anaesthesia (ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (3. 8 mg/kg) i. p.) six normal hearing cats were implanted bilaterally with a three channel platinum (Pt) scala tympani electrode array, while a return Pt-electrode was placed outside the bulla. Chronic electrical stimulation using charge-balanced biphasic current pulses was delivered unilaterally via a transcutaneous leadwire connected to a backpack-stimulator for up to 2000 h. The animals hearing status was periodically monitored using <b>acoustically</b> <b>evoked</b> compound action <b>potentials</b> (CAP's) and brainstem responses (ABR's). In addition the electrically evoked ABR (EABR) was also recorded to ensure that the chronic stimulus was above threshold. Stimulus current and electrode voltage waveforms were monitored twice daily and access resistance (Ra) and electrode impedance (Zc) calculated. ABR and CAP thresholds were elevated immediately following implantation, but generally showed evidence of partial recovery (0 - 40 dB). Further deterioration of thresholds on the stimulated side (10 - 30 dB) was subsequently observed, while control-thresholds remained more stable. Ra (1. 3 - 1. 8 kΩ) and Zc (2. 2 - 3. 8 Ω) typically increased in the first few weeks of electrical stimulation up to Ra: 5. 6 kΩ and Zc: 8. 1 kΩ, before decreasing slightly to a constant plateau. These initial results indicate changes in the electrode-tissue interface and tissue growth within the cochlea. They also indicate that chronic stimulation at these high rates may decrease residual hearing. 27 - 30 JanuaryOpen Acces...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} little enthusiasm for {{somatosensory}} <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> monitoring in cervical spine sur-gery as a result, in part, of the increased risk of motor tract injury at this level, to which somatosensory monitoring may be insensitive.

MethodsBetween November 2008 and January 2010, 105 thoracic aorta repairs were performed; 89 % of patients (93 / 105) underwent repair using cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion. In addition, somatosensory and motor <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were monitored during repair, and active intraoperative maneuvers were undertaken in response {{to changes in the}} signals. Intraoperative maneuvers included intercostal artery reimplantation. ResultsIn-hospital mortality for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair was 5. 7 % (6 / 105). Immediate spinal cord injury occurred in 1 patient (1 %), and 3 patients (3 %) had delayed neurologic deficit. Intercostal arteries were reattached in 85 % of possible cases (51 / 60). Somatosensory <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> achieved adequate readings in 99 % of cases (102 / 103). Loss of somatosensory <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> was encountered in 26 % of cases (27 / 102), and return of somatosensory <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> occurred in all cases after intraoperative maneuvers. Motor <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> achieved adequate readings in 96 % of cases (99 / 103). Loss of motor <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> was encountered in 50 % of cases (50 / 99), and return of motor <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> occurred in all but 1 case (95 %).

Methods: 28 Patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis underwent clinical evaluation with Kurtzke’s Modified S and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite(MSFC). 19 Participants also underwent the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis. Visual, Brainstem Auditory, Somatosensory and Motor <b>Evoked</b> <b>Potentials</b> were recorded on all. Results were graded by variants of the Global <b>Evoked</b> <b>Potential</b> Score, Multiple <b>Evoked</b> <b>Potential</b> Score and Summation of Z transformed <b>Evoked</b> <b>Potential</b> Latencies for correlation against the clinical scores. Conclusions: Multi-modal <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> batteries generally show moderate and useful correlation with clinical status {{as measured by the}} regulatory standard of EDSS (r =. 65 vs. mEPS p <. 005) and MSFC (r =. 39 vs. mEPS p <. 05). The graded qualitative mEPS scoring system displayed the strongest relation ship although the influence of scoring system applied appeared reassuringly minimal. Non-association with cognitive impairment is an important limitation however...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is very standardized. However, {{there is a}} lack of an objective method to evaluate the cerebral effects of bilirubin apart from brainstem auditory <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials.</b> There were few studies evaluating the effects of hyperbilirubinemia or phototherapy on the visual pathway in infants with hyperbilirubinemia. Serial visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> of two groups of term neonates (N = 24) - group 1 with moderate hyperbilirubinemia (n = 16) and group 2 with severe hyperbilirubinemia (n = 8) - were evaluated prospectively. All infants had regular physical, neurologic, visual, and auditory evaluations until 3 years. Four (16 %) had abnormal visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> before 1 year, and the abnormalities returned to normal thereafter. There was no significant difference in visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> between the two groups. All had normal neurodevelopmental status by 3 years, with the exception of one child from the severe group with ABO incompatibility with transient mild motor delay, hypotonia, and abnormal visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potential.</b> There were no abnormal effects of phototherapy on visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> in infants with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia after 1 year of age. Although our sample size was small, the results suggest that the effects of hyperbilirubinemia on visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> might be transient. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
