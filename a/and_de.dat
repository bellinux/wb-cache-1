5|$|In 1780, a fleet with 6,000troops {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Jean-Baptiste, comte de Rochambeau landed at Newport, Rhode Island, and shortly afterwards the fleet was blockaded by the British. In early 1781, Washington <b>and</b> <b>de</b> Rochambeau planned {{an attack against}} the British in the Chesapeake Bay area to coordinate {{with the arrival of}} a large fleet {{commanded by}} Vice Admiral François, comte de Grasse. Successfully deceiving the British that an attack was planned in New York, Washington <b>and</b> <b>de</b> Rochambeau marched to Virginia, <b>and</b> <b>de</b> Grasse began landing forces near Yorktown, Virginia. On 5 September 1781 a major naval action was fought by de Grasse and the British at the Battle of the Virginia Capes, ending with the French fleet in control of the Chesapeake Bay. The U.S. Navy continued to interdict British supply ships until peace was finally declared in late 1783.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{what is now}} NY812 between Lowville and Croghan became the southern leg of NY26A, an alternate route of NY26 between Lowville and Carthage. Farther north, the portion of modern NY812 between De Kalb and Ogdensburg became part of NY87, a route extending from Harrisville to Ogdensburg via Edwards, Russell <b>and</b> <b>De</b> Kalb. From Harrisville to Fowler, NY87 followed a parallel alignment to modern NY812 along Hands Flats, Stone, and Pitcairn roads, and CR24. Between Fowler <b>and</b> <b>De</b> Kalb, NY87 used what is now NY58, CR24, and CR17 before following current NY812 north to Ogdensburg. The portion of NY87 between De Kalb Junction <b>and</b> <b>De</b> Kalb was concurrent with US11. Both US11 and NY87 were shifted south onto a new highway , at which time the former routing of US11 between the new road <b>and</b> <b>De</b> Kalb became part of NY87.|$|E

5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous <b>and</b> <b>De</b> la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), <b>and</b> <b>de</b> gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E

The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, <b>and</b> <b>de</b> Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
