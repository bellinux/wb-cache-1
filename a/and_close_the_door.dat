25|$|As Romans was evacuated, one of {{the other}} SWAT {{officers}} then spotted Mixon beside the bedroom door, equipped with the SKS rifle, and fired at him. Mixon was forced to retreat inside the room <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The team moved towards the bedroom and partially forced the door open. As he managed to get inside, Sakai was shot and mortally wounded by Mixon. Gonzales rushed into the room next and tripped on the floor, falling in front of Mixon. Mixon shot at Gonzales while he was falling and may have struck Gonzales in the head, although the bullet was deflected by Gonzales' tactical helmet, which protected him from injury. Spotting Mixon, Gonzales opened fire and was joined by Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy Derrick Pope; Mixon was felled by the barrage of gunfire and died from his wounds at 3:20p.m.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter {{with a heavy}} {{emphasis}} on cooperative gameplay. The game presents five new campaigns, each composed of three to five smaller levels. As in the first game, each campaign is presented in menus and loading screens as a film starring the four Survivors; and features, upon completing a campaign, a faux credits screen which acts as the final scoreboard for the players and recaps certain performance statistics for the group. In every campaign, most levels involve the Survivors attempting to reach a safe zone <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> once they are all safely inside. However, the final level in each campaign requires the Survivors to call for rescue and either survive a prolonged onslaught until rescue arrives, pass through an especially challenging gauntlet of Infected to reach an escape vehicle, or (in Dead Center and The Passing) collect and utilize fuel cans to enable their escape.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and do it themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|As time passed, the Commissioner {{seemed to}} grow more silent, solitary, and reserved. A new phase of mind {{developed}} in him. He could not endure {{the presence of a}} child. Often when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the big business-room adjoining his little apartment, the Commissioner would steal softly <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He would always cross the street to avoid meeting the school-children when they came dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk, and his firm mouth would close into a mere line.|$|E
60|$|To {{keep out}} of the way of the Princess Adelaide was easy enough, presuming that she kept her word and {{remained}} in her cabin.

I lit a pipe and leaned over the side. I had scarcely been there two minutes when I heard a light footstep coming along the deck and pause a few feet away. A girl's voice addressed me.|$|E
