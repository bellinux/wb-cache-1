The wreaths, which in Western culture are perceived as symbols of victory and of mourning, appeared in Gershuni’s works as self-contained images floating in empty space. Alongside wreaths with abundant petals were also wreaths that were nearly bare. “The wreath project gradually wilted and dropped off,” Gershuni testified, “the glory faded, the wreaths became bare.” In one of my last I wrote “Come, my bride,” but not in the usual sense, but rather in the sense of wilting, annihilation, end.” ...|$|R

All the more surprising then is the multitude of works made especially for Bregenz which lays out the differentiated repertoire of Cosima von Bonin in an unusually epic density, starting with her large canvas paintings, via textile sculptures and estranged reconstructions, through to voluminous installations. The architecture of the three floors of the KUB becomes a stage on which the textile and wooden figures seem to be actors - a move reinforced by soundtracks composed by Moritz von Oswald especially for Cosima von Bonin that can be heard at various points in the spaces of the KUB.

40|$|Abstract — Traditionally, musical {{instrument}} recognition is mainly based on {{frequency domain analysis}} (sinusoidal analysis, cepstral coefficients) and shape analysis to extract a set of various features. Instruments are usually classified using k-NN classifiers, HMM, Kohonen SOM and Neural Networks. Recognition of {{musical instrument}}s in multi-instrumental, polyphonic music is a difficult challenge which is yet far from being solved. Successful instrument recognition techniques in solos (monophonic or polyphonic recordings of single instruments) can help {{to deal with this}} task. We introduce an instrument recognition process in solo recordings of a set of instruments (flute, guitar and harmonium), which yields a high recognition rate. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>solo</b> database is used in order to encompass the different sound possibilities of each instrument and evaluate the generalization abilities of the classification process. The basic characteristics are computed in 1 sec interval and result shows that the estimation of spectrogram and autocorrelation reflects more effectively the difference in musical instruments...|$|R
