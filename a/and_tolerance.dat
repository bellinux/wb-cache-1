5|$|Antoinism is {{a healing}} and Christian-oriented new {{religious}} movement founded in 1910 by the Walloon Louis-Joseph Antoine (1846–1912) in Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, Seraing. With a total of 64 temples, over forty reading rooms across the world and thousands of members, it remains the only religion established in Belgium whose notoriety and success has reached outside the country. Mainly active in France, the religious movement {{is characterized by a}} decentralized structure, simple rites, discretion <b>and</b> <b>tolerance</b> towards other faiths.|$|E

5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest.

Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival <b>and</b> <b>tolerance</b> in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E

5|$|Surveys {{also show}} that green is the color most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, <b>and</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E
5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, <b>and</b> <b>tolerance</b> to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are {{regarded as one of the}} most promising species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E
5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study of rejection <b>and</b> <b>tolerance</b> induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of this}} body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to be faithful to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support <b>and</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{restrictions}} against royalist {{candidates and}} voters were widely ignored, and the elections {{resulted in a}} House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The new so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience <b>and</b> <b>tolerance.</b> There would be liberty of conscience and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year, and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a bat in {{the genus}} Triaenops found on Madagascar, {{mainly in the}} drier regions. It was known as Triaenops rufus until 2009, when it was {{discovered}} that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. Triaenops rufus is a synonym of Triaenops persicus, a Middle Eastern species closely related to T.menamena— the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a subspecies of T.persicus by some authors. Triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as butterflies and moths. Because of its wide range, common occurrence, <b>and</b> <b>tolerance</b> of habitat degradation, it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence <b>and</b> <b>tolerance,</b> often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
