40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{conductivity}} of five semi-crystalline and four <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> was determined within {{a wide range}} of temperature, starting at room temperature and going up to temperatures above the polymer melting point (Tm) for semi-crystalline polymers or above the glass transition temperature (Tg) for <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers.</b> Two transient techniques were employed in the experimental investigation: the hot wire technique for the group of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers,</b> and the laser flash technique for the semicrystalline polymers. As expected, the experimental results show that Tg exerts a measureable influence on the {{thermal conductivity}} of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers.</b> In the case of semi-crystalline polymers, a singular behaviour of the thermal conductivity is observed within the Tm range. In order to explain the anomalous behaviour, the influence of these transition temperatures on the thermal conductivity behaviour with temperature has been analysed in terms of a phonon conduction process and temperature variations of specific heat and modulus of elasticity of the analyzed polymers...|$|R

50|$|CTE {{depends upon}} thermal {{transitions}} {{such as the}} glass transition. CTE of the glassy state is low, while at the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased degrees of molecular segmental motion are released so CTE of the rubbery state is high. Changes in an <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer</b> may involve other sub-Tg thermal transitions associated with short molecular segments, side-chains and branches. The linearity of the sf-TM curve will be changed by such transitions.|$|E
50|$|The {{properties}} of bullet-resistant glass {{can be affected}} by temperature and by exposure to solvents or UV radiation, usually from sunlight. If the polycarbonate layer is below a glass layer, it has some protection from UV radiation due to the glass and bonding layer. Over time the polycarbonate becomes more brittle {{because it is an}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer</b> (which is necessary for it to be transparent) that moves toward thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|Below their glass {{transition}} temperature, <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> are usually hard and brittle {{because of the}} low mobility of their molecules. Increasing the temperature induces molecular motion resulting in the typical rubber-elastic properties. A constant force applied to a polymer at temperatures above Tg results in a viscoelastic deformation, i.e., the polymer begins to creep. Heat resistance is thus given for <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> just below the {{glass transition}} temperature.|$|R

50|$|Crystalline {{polymers}} {{are usually}} opaque because of light scattering on the numerous boundaries between the crystalline and amorphous regions. The density of such boundaries is lower {{and thus the}} transparency is higher either for low (<b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer)</b> or high (crystalline) degree of crystallinity. For example, atactic polypropylene is usually amorphous and transparent while syndiotactic polypropylene, which has crystallinity ~50%, is opaque. Crystallinity also affects dyeing of polymers: crystalline polymers {{are more difficult to}} stain than amorphous ones because the dye molecules penetrate much easier through amorphous regions.|$|E
50|$|The {{ethylene}} {{content is}} around 45% to 85%. The higher the ethylene content, {{the higher the}} loading possibilities of the polymer, better mixing, and extrusion. Peroxide curing these polymers gives a higher crosslink density compared with their amorphous counterpart. The <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer</b> is also excellent in processing. This is very much influenced by their molecular structure. The dienes, typically comprising from 2.5% to 12% by weight of the composition, serve as cross-links when curing with sulphur and resin; with peroxide cures, the diene (or third monomer) functions as a coagent, which provides resistance to unwanted tackiness, creep, or flow during end use.|$|E

40|$|With the {{advantages}} of high-formability, low-cost and unique physical properties, polymers {{have been widely used}} in microforming of polymeric components for a large scale of applications in many fields including micro-optics, microfluidic and sensors, etc. In micro-scale, the deformation behaviors of polymers are observed to be size-dependent. Conventional constitutive models of polymers, however, cannot predict and represent those size-dependent behaviors well. To address this issue, a constitutive model with consideration of size effect for <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> in micro-scale was developed in this research. Firstly, {{on the basis of the}} couple stress theory, the impact of rotational gradients was taken into consideration and a strain gradient “elastic-viscoplastic” constitutive model was proposed to quantitatively describe the size-dependent behaviors of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> in micro-scale. After that, four point micro-bending experiments were implemented on poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films with thickness varying from the millimeter scale to micrometer scale. The size effect of PMMA in micro-scale was further illustrated and the proposed strain gradient “elastic-viscoplastic” model was finally validated and verified for the capability of modeling of the size effect of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> in micro-scaled deformation.

50|$|The trans double bonds formed during {{polymerization}} {{allow the}} polymer chain to stay rather straight, allowing sections of polymer chains to align to form microcrystalline {{regions in the}} material. The cis double bonds cause {{a bend in the}} polymer chain, preventing polymer chains from aligning to form crystalline regions, which results in larger regions of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer.</b> It has been found that a substantial percentage of cis double bond configurations in the polymer will result in a material with flexible elastomer (rubber-like) qualities. In free radical polymerization, both cis and trans double bonds will form in percentages that depend on temperature. The catalysts influence the cis vs trans ratio.|$|E
50|$|If {{the melt}} of an (organic) <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer</b> is cooled down, it solidifies at the glass-transition {{temperature}} Tg. On cooling, the hardness of the polymer {{increases in the}} neighborhood of Tg by several orders of magnitude. This hardening follows the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation, not the Arrhenius equation. Organic polymers are thus called fragile glass formers. Silicon glass (e.g., window glass), is in contrast labelled as a strong glass former. Its viscosity changes only very slowly {{in the vicinity of the}} glass-transition point Tg and follows the Arrhenius law. Only via this gradual change in viscosity is glassblowing possible. If one would try to shape an organic polymer in the same manner as a glass, it would at first firmly and fully liquefy near Tg already at slightly higher temperatures. For a theoretical glassblowing of organic polymers, the temperature must be controlled very precisely.|$|E
50|$|However, {{copper ions}} have a {{promiscuous}} nature {{that allows them}} to bind to a variety of ligands, which readily form stable metallogels with tunable properties, widening the scope of their applications. Bipyridines were among the most important ligands, since the formation of those metallogels can lead to research about the coordination of copper ions to DNA base pairs. Oxalic acid dihydrate is another important ligand, that easily forms stable structures when copper salts are added, which can be used as proton conductors. Furthermore, a bile acid-picolinic acid conjugate can form gels in solvents that are 30%-50% organic. The increased water content renders this gel more bio-compatible, offering room for further investigation. One of the most recent studies in copper hydrogels involved adding glyme to the polymer to observe the resultant effect on the network. It has formed a stronger <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymer</b> that is anticipated to have self-healing properties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} tool for the investigation of molecular dynamics of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> over a large temperature range and frequency scale. In this work, by using high precision shear mechanical spectroscopy tool, we have investigated the segmental dynamics from local segmental relaxation to sub-Rouse modes in a series of <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers.</b> We have demonstrated the existence of sub-Rouse modes slower than the local segmental motion in <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers.</b> The sub-Rouse modes exhibit a similar change of dynamics at the same temperature TB ~ 1. 2 Tg, as the local segmental relaxation through the temperature dependence of relaxation time and relaxation strength. Furthermore, the crossover relaxation time of the sub-Rouse modes at TB is almost the same for all the polymers investigated, i. e. τα'(TB) = 10 - 1 ± 0. 5 s, which is independent of molecular weight and molecular structure. This remarkable finding indicates that solely the time scale of the relaxation determines the change in dynamics of the sub-Rouse modes. According to the coupling model, the crossover is suggested to be caused by the onset of strong intermolecular cooperativity below TB. Hence the results suggest that the sub-Rouse modes and their properties are generally found in <b>amorphous</b> <b>polymers</b> by mechanical spectroscopy, and reveal the cooperative nature of the sub-Rouse modes...|$|R
