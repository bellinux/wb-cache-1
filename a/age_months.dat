40|$|Four main {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of language treatment methods with aphasic stroke patients. Experiment 1 was designed to compare an operant speech training procedure devised by Goodkin (1966) with speech therapy and with an attention placebo treatment. Twenty-four patients with moderate aphasia (35 to 65 %ile on the PICA) received four weeks of speech therapy and four weeks of either operant training, or non-specific treatment. Results indicated {{no significant differences between}} the treatments. Patients showed significant improvement in language abilities but this was unrelated to <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> post onset or handedness. Experiment 2, was a preliminary investigation of speech therapy with eighteen severe aphasics (below 35 %ile on the PICA). Patients shov/ed significant improvement in language abilities but this was unrelated to <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> post onset or amount of speech therapy received. In Experiment 3 operant training and an attention placebo were each given for 4 weeks, in addition to speech therapy, to twelve severe aphasics. No significant differences occurred between treatments and patients showed significant change which was unrelated to age or months post onset. Experiment 4 compared the treated patients in Experiments 1 and 2 with a no treatment control group. Results indicated {{no significant differences between the}} groups over a four week interval. Three subsidiary {{experiments were}} carried out to assess the reliability of some assessment procedures used, the Token Test shortened version, the Object Naming test and the Speech Questionnaire. Language retraining methods, as used at Rivermead Rehabilitation Centre, were shown not to improve language abilities more than attention placebo treatments or no treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} a quantitative ultrasound technique for measuring bone tissue at the proximal phalanxes of the non-dominant hand. We correlated the mean value of the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) measured at the distal metaphysis {{of the last four}} proximal phalanxes with <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> since menopause and bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine in 264 women. We further assessed the ability of the AD-SoS to discriminate between normal and osteoporotic subjects with documented vertebral fractures. We found a positive correlation between the AD-SoS and the lumbar spine BMD, whereas the AD-SoS negatively correlated with age and months since menopause. The AD-SoS showed a higher correlation with age changes and months since menopause than BMD. The AD-SoS was significantly higher in healthy females than in osteoporotic ones (p < 0. 001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed for age adjusted values that AD-SoS decrease is significantly associated to the presence of fracture. Our results suggest that AD-SoS is valuable in assessing age and menopause related bone loss and is useful for diagnosing osteoporosis...|$|E

Of 1025 eligible infants, 881 (86. 0 %) returned for all five visits and had adequate serum samples for testing. Seroconversion to measles after vaccination at 9 months was 98. 1 %. At 15 months, 47 (5. 3 %) of the 881 children were seronegative for measles; of these, 44 (93. 6 %) seroconverted. At 16 months, 99 % of the children seronegative at <b>age</b> 9 <b>months</b> seroconverted after receiving two doses of measles vaccine. At <b>age</b> 15 <b>months,</b> 684 (77. 6 %) children were seronegative for rubella.

Though age and MPO appear to predict immediate improvement, they do not predict maintenance of learned skills following treatment termination and therefore should not be used to inform enrollment decisions. Baseline lexical retrieval ability predicted trained and untrained real word confrontation naming 3 months following treatment termination. These results lend support for the importance of considering residual lexical-semantic abilities when enrolling participants into phonomotor treatment...|$|E

We analyzed retrospectively our non-Hodgkin's lymphoma survey of 60 patients harvested with G-CSF alone after a unique first line chemotherapy; 67 % of patients harvested a sufficient number of CD 34 + cells during the first attempt of mobilization. The charachteristics of leukaphereses procedures were the same for all the patients. Sex, <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> from the end of chemo- or radio-therapy did not have a significance in influencing mobilization capability, while requirement of G-CSF during chemotherapy was statistically different from failures to successes: 16 / 20 (80 %) of patients failing to reach the target of 2 x 10 (6) /kg CD 34 + cells had required G-CSF support during previous chemotherapy versus 18 / 40 (45 %) in the successful group (p 0, 005). Our observation supports the hypotesis that individual biological charachteristics of each patient are the most important factors in affecting mobilization capability, deserving further investigation: mobilization schedules tailored on a given patient would minimize the rate of failures, avoiding a second attempt of collection that implies additional economic expenses and negative consequences on the maintenance of dose intensity...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the relation between}} climacteric symptoms or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease and oxidative status of postmenopausal women. Methods Cross-sectional investigation performed at the outpatient service for the menopause at the University Hospital, on 50 apparently healthy women in physiological postmenopause. The whole-blood free oxygen radical test (FORT), free oxygen radical defence (FORD), <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> since menopause, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, estradiol, lipids, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (glucose/insulin and HOMA-IR), and fibrinogen were evaluated. The Greene Climacteric Scale with its subscales {{was used to evaluate}} climacteric symptoms. The pulsatility index, an index of downstream blood flow resistance, was determined for both the internal carotid artery and the brachial artery. Results The waist-to-hip ratio (r 0. 540; p 0. 0001), estradiol (r 0. 548; p 0. 0004) and waist circumfer- ence (r 0. 345; p 0. 02) were independently related to blood FORT. The score in the Greene vasomotor subscale was the only parameter independently related to blood FORD (r 0. 554; p 0. 0001). FORT was not related to the artery pulsatility index, while FORD was negatively related to the pulsatility index of both the internal carotid (r 0. 549; p 0. 0001) and the brachial (r 0. 484; p 0. 0001) arteries. Discussion In postmenopausal women, abdominal adiposity and hypoestrogenism increase oxidative stress. Climacteric symptoms, particularly vasomotor symptoms, markedly reduce antioxidant defences. Lower antioxidant defences are associated with higher resistance to blood flow in the great arteries. In women early after the menopause, visceral fat, hypoestrogenism and climacteric symptoms may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory predictors of death in under-five children with clinically defined sepsis presenting with diarrhea. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all the diarrheal children (n = 151) aged 0 to 59 months with clinical sepsis admitted in the SCW during September’ 2007 through December’ 2007. Comparison was made between deaths (n = 23) and survivors (n = 128). Sepsis is defined as presence of inflammation [abnormal WBC count (> 11 × 109 /L or, < 4 × 109 /L or, band and neutrophil ratio ≤ 0. 10] plus presence or presumed presence of infection with thermo-instability [hypo (≤ 35. 0 ˚C) or hyperthermia (≥ 38. 5 ˚C) ], tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or the indications of altered organ function (altered mental status and bounding pulse) {{in the absence of}} clinical dehydration or after correction of dehydration.

According to WHO and BTS criteria, severe CAP was present in 57 (50 %) and in 96 (85 %) cases, respectively; 29 (26 %) were aged less than 1 year. The median <b>age</b> (<b>months)</b> was 22 (mean 24 [*]±[*] 14, range 2 – 58). Overall, radiographic finding was right-sided in 77 (68 %) cases and the upper lobe was compromised in 36 (32 %) cases. By analyzing data stratified to age, the frequency of upper lobe involvement was significantly higher among severe cases (WHO criteria) only for those patients aged ≥ 1 year (13 / 35 [37 %] vs. 7 / 45 [16 %], P[*]=[*] 0. 03, OR [95 % CI] 3. 2 [1. 1 – 9. 2]). The specificity and positive predictive value of upper lobe involvement for severity among the latter group of patients were 84 % (95 % CI 70 – 93 %) and 65 % (95 % CI 41 – 84 %), respectively.

A post-hoc analysis of five randomised studies in patients with a history of previous exacerbations examined the {{clinical and}} demographic characteristics describing moderate-to-very-severe COPD. MethodsFactor analysis was performed on all continuous baseline demographic and clinical data, without variable selection. Analyses were based on the full cohort and on stratifications by pack-years smoked, smoking status, gender, and comorbidities; patient exacerbation history was analysed in two of the five studies. Findings 6162 COPD patients were evaluated (70 % male; 40 % current smokers; mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1  s [FEV 1] 35. 2 % predicted). Baseline {{clinical and demographic}} variables loaded differentially on six factors with minimal overlap, explaining 60. 4 % of the heterogeneity: 1) symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, sleep disturbance), health status, reliever use; 2) pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, FEV 1 /forced vital capacity, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), body mass index (BMI); 3) blood pressure; 4) <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> since first COPD symptoms; 5) PEF variability; 6) pulse, FEV 1 reversibility.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and the dilatation after sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG, 25 microgram) were measured by using high-resolution ultrasound in the brachial artery in 64 coarctation patients (44 males and 20 females, aged 19 +/- 10 years; median age at operation 4 months) and 45 control subjects (28 males and 17 females, aged 19 +/- 10 years) and in the posterior tibial artery in 37 patients and 22 control subjects. Arterial stiffness was determined by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) of the brachioradial and femoral-dorsalis pedis tracts. Patients, compared with control subjects, had lower brachial FMD (7. 16 +/- 3. 4 % versus 8. 62 +/- 2. 3 %, respectively; P= 0. 02) and NTG (11. 46 +/- 4. 3 % versus 13. 21 +/- 4. 6 %, respectively; P= 0. 046) and higher brachioradial PWV (9. 17 +/- 3. 1 versus 8. 06 +/- 1. 9 m/s, respectively; P= 0. 05). In contrast, posterior tibial FMD, NTG, and lower limb PWV were comparable. <b>Age</b> (<b>months)</b> at the time of repair was related to brachioradial PWV (r= 0. 42, P= 0. 002) but not to brachial FMD or NTG. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with repaired aortic coarctation have impaired conduit artery function, with abnormal responses to flow and NTG, and increased vascular stiffness confined to {{the upper part of the}} body. Early repair is associated with preserved elastic properties of conduit arteries, but reduced reactivity remains...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preoperative knee {{function}} {{is associated with}} successful postoperative outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, there are few longer term studies of patients who underwent progressive preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation compared to usual care. Objectives: To compare preoperative and 2  year postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients undergoing progressive preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation at a sports medicine clinic compared with usual care. Methods: We included patients aged 16 – 40  years undergoing primary unilateral ACLR. The preoperative and 2  year postoperative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) of 84 patients undergoing progressive preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation at a sports medicine clinic (Norwegian Research Center for Active Rehabilitation (NAR) cohort) were compared with the scores of 2690 patients from the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry (NKLR). The analyses were adjusted for sex, <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> from injury to surgery and cartilage/meniscus injury at ACLR. Results: The NAR cohort had significantly better preoperative KOOS in all subscales, with clinically relevant differences (> 10 points) observed in KOOS Pain, {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), Sports and Quality of Life. At 2  years, the NAR cohort still had significantly better KOOS with clinically relevant differences in KOOS Symptoms, Sports and Quality of Life. At 2  years, 85. 7 – 94 % of the patients in the NAR cohort scored within the normative range of the different KOOS subscales, compared to 51. 4 – 75. 8 % of the patients in the NKLR. Conclusions: Patients in a prospective cohort who underwent progressive preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation at a sports medicine clinic showed superior patient-reported outcomes both preoperatively and 2  years postoperatively compared to patients in the NKLR who received usual care...|$|E

40|$|Background: Risks {{of death}} are high when {{children}} with pneumonia also have severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as a co-morbidity. However, {{there is limited}} published information on risk factors of death from pneumonia in SAM children. We evaluated clinically identifiable factors associated with death in under-five children who were hospitalized {{for the management of}} pneumonia and SAM. Methods: For this unmatched case-control design, SAM children of either sex, aged 0 – 59 months, admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) during April 2011 to July 2012 with radiological pneumonia were studied. The SAM children with pneumonia who had fatal outcome constituted the cases (n = 35), and randomly selected SAM children with pneumonia who survived constituted controls (n = 105). Results: The median (inter-quartile range) <b>age</b> (<b>months)</b> was comparable among the cases and the controls [8. 0 (4. 9, 11. 0) vs. 9. 7 (5. 0, 18. 0); p = 0. 210) ]. In logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders, such as vomiting, abnormal mental status, and systolic hypotension (, 70 mm of Hg) in absence of dehydration, fatal cases of severely malnourished under-five children with pneumonia were more often hypoxemic (OR = 23. 15, 95 % CI = 4. 38 – 122. 42), had clinical dehydration (some/severe) (OR = 9. 48, 95 % CI = 2. 42 – 37. 19), abdominal distension at admission (OR = 4. 41, 95 % CI = 1. 12 – 16. 52), and received blood transfusion (OR = 5. 50, 95 % CI = 1. 21 – 24. 99) for the management of crystalloid resistan...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} and demographic variables defining the heterogeneity of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are unclear. A post-hoc analysis of five randomised studies in patients with a history of previous exacerbations examined the {{clinical and}} demographic characteristics describing moderate-to-very-severe COPD. Methods: Factor analysis was performed on all continuous baseline demographic and clinical data, without variable selection. Analyses were based on the full cohort and on stratifications by pack-years smoked, smoking status, gender, and comorbidities; patient exacerbation history was analysed in two of the five studies. Findings: 6162 COPD patients were evaluated (70 % male; 40 % current smokers; mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1] 35. 2 % predicted). Baseline {{clinical and demographic}} variables loaded differentially on six factors with minimal overlap, explaining 60. 4 % of the heterogeneity: 1) symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, steep disturbance), health status, reliever use; 2) pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, FEV 1 /forced vital capacity, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), body mass index (BMI); 3) blood pressure; 4) <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> since first COPD symptoms; 5) PEF variability; 6) pulse, FEV 1 reversibility. Most factors loaded similarly in stratified and exacerbation analyses. BMI loaded with reversibility in females, and with age and months since first COPD symptoms in ex-smokers. Exacerbations loaded to factor 6. Interpretation: Readily available data can explain similar to 60 % of COPD heterogeneity in a large dataset of predominantly severe COPD patients. Factors were robust over determinants of disease outcome; gender, smoking status, pack-years smoked, and comorbidities. The main factors were largely unchanged by adding exacerbations. Only BMI loaded to other factors. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In 1972 a {{total of}} 112 workers exposed to toluene {{diisocyanate}} (TDI) were examined for acute pulmonary function changes during a work shift {{on the first day}} of the working week. A dose-response relationship was demonstrated for the acute effects of TDI in this population. The cohort was restudied in 1974 to determine whether there was excessive loss of pulmonary function, and if so, whether there was an exposure level below which this did not occur. The original cohort was reduced to 63 workers available for re-survey of which 57 could be assigned reliable personal exposure levels for the two-year study period. Pulmonary function measurements were made again before and after work {{on the first day of}} the working week. A total of 132 environmental samples were collected on this and previous occasions during the study period. The 57 workers were divided into three exposure subgroups (≤ 0 · 0015; 0 · 0020 - 0 · 0030; ≥ 0 · 0035 ppm). Using the FEV 1 · 0 as a measure of response, a dose-response relationship was observed. Only those in the lowest exposure subgroup showed normal two-year declines. The FEV 1 · 0 of those in the highest exposure group fell 206 ml in two years (103 ml/year) which exceeds the expected value by three- to fourfold. The decrement of FEV 1 · 0 in the middle exposure group was borderline (42 ml/year). These differences in FEV 1 · 0 by exposure subgroup were not explained by <b>age,</b> <b>months</b> employed, smoking habits, or variables related to lung size. A significant association (r = 0 · 35, p < 0 · 005) between acute and chronic decrement in FEV 1 · 0 was shown again. We conclude that chronic occupational exposure to TDI at 0 · 003 ppm or higher is unsafe...|$|E
