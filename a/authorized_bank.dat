50|$|In 1978 the Federal Reserve Board had <b>authorized</b> <b>bank</b> holding {{companies}} to establish securities affiliates that underwrote and dealt in government securities and other bank-eligible securities. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker supported Congress amending Glass-Steagall to permit such affiliates to underwrite and deal {{in a limited}} amount of bank-ineligible securities, but not corporate securities. In 1987, Volcker specifically noted (and approved the result) that this would mean only banks with large government securities activities would be able to have affiliates that would underwrite and deal in a significant volume of “bank-ineligible securities.” A Section 20 affiliate with a large volume of government securities related revenue would be able to earn a significant amount of “bank-ineligible” revenue without having more than 5% of its overall revenue come from bank-ineligible activities. Volcker disagreed, however, that the Board had authority to permit this without an amendment to the Glass-Steagall Act. Citing that concern, Volcker and fellow Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell dissented from the Section 20 affiliate orders.|$|E

40|$|Abankers acceptance, or BA, is a {{time draft}} drawn on and {{accepted}} by a bank. Before acceptance, the draft is not an obligation of the bank; it is merely an order by the drawer to the bank to pay a specified sum of money on a specified date to a named person or to the bearer of the draft. Upon acceptance, which occurs when an <b>authorized</b> <b>bank</b> employee stamps the draft “accepted ” and signs it, the draft becomes a primary and unconditional liability of the bank. If the bank is well known and enjoys a good reputation, the accepted draft may be readily sold in an active market. 1. THE CREATION OF A BANKERS ACCEPTANCE Acceptances arise most often in connection with international trade: U. S. imports and exports and trade between foreign countries. 1 An American importer may request acceptance financing from its bank when, as is frequently the case in international trade, {{it does not have}} a close relationship with and cannot obtain financing from the exporter it is dealing with.
