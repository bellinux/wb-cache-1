40|$|The {{complexity}} of the interplay between tectonics and sedimentation increases when salt tectonics is involved because of the ductility of salt {{and its ability to}} flow. Discrimination between extensional tectonics and salt-related processes is problematic; especially where salt-related rift basins were inverted as occurred in the Central High Atlas in Morocco. The aim of the present work was to analyse and understand the dynamics of the Central High Atlas diapiric basin during the Early Jurassic rift and subsequent post-rift periods using a multidisciplinary workflow integrating fieldwork, analogue models and subsidence and thermal numerical modelling. Two regions were examined to assess the effects of salt tectonics {{in the evolution of the}} basin; the Djebel Bou Dahar platform-basin system represented the fault domain of the rift basin where diapiric activity was not described and the Tazoult-Amezraï area and Imilchil diapiric province corresponding to the unstable domain of the basin characterised by the presence of diapiric salt ridges and minibasins. Results from analogue models highlighted the intrinsic interrelation between extension, diapirism and sedimentation that characterised the diapiric domain of the Central High Atlas. Longitudinal and transverse sedimentary progradations and their timing had a strong impact in the migration of ductile layers, in the growth of diapirs and in their lateral structural variations; triggering well-developed passive diapirs in the proximal domains and incipient reactive diapirs or poorly developed roller-like and passive diapirs in the distal domains of the sediment source. Analogue models including post-diapiric compression fairly reproduced the observed structure in the studied areas. Modelling with 6 % and 10 % of shortening, slightly lower than the Atlas one, produced the progressive close-up of the two flanks of salt walls and their final welding as well as the steepening of their outward flanks, with dips increasing from 8 o- 17 o prior to compression to 30 o- 50 o after compression. Subsidence curves varied depending on the analysed localities of the rift basin. Djebel Bou Dahar showed long-term and low-rate tectonic and total subsidence (0. 06 and 0. 08 mm yr- 1, respectively). The roughly parallel evolution of both total and tectonic subsidence curves indicates the main extensional tectonic influence on subsidence pattern, as corroborated by the syndepositional activity of the outcropping Sinemurian-Pliensbachian normal faults. In the unstable domain, Amezraï minibasin centre showed tectonic and total subsidence rates between 0. 06 - 0. 32 and 0. 19 - 0. 98 mm yr- 1, rates one order of magnitude higher than in the Djebel Bou Dahar. These subsidence rates were up to two-fold their equivalent rates in the Tazoult salt wall (0. 01 - 0. 27 and 0. 09 - 0. 74 mm yr- 1). In the Imilchil diapiric province lateral shifts of the main subsiding depocenters were recorded during Toarcian to Callovian times (tectonic and total subsidence rates up to 0. 23 and 0. 90 mm yr- 1). The subsidence of the unstable domain was caused by the combination of normal fault extension and salt withdrawal from beneath the minibasins during rifting, being the salt-related subsidence predominant during the post-rift and masking the expected subsidence pattern for a rift-post rift transition. For the first time, 27 new vitrinite reflectance data were used to build the thermal evolution and associated geohistory of the Central High Atlas. Thermal models, with heat flows of 105 mW/m 2 (from 189 to 140 Ma) followed by 60 mW/m 2 and 70 mW/m 2 (from 189 to 182. 7 Ma) followed by 60 mW/m 2, pointed to a post-Middle Jurassic evolution characterised by long-term and low-rate subsidence and an overburden between 1200 - 2400 m on the Tazoult-Amezraï area. The comparison of subsidence curves from this study with Saharan Atlas and Tunisian Atlas showed that peak of subsidence in these salt-related domains became younger to the east. La discriminació entre processos associats a tectònica extensiva i a tectònica salina es problemàtica; especialment en conques diapíriques extensives invertides com és el cas del Alt Atles Central de Marroc (CHA). L’objectiu d’aquesta tesis és analitzar i entendre els processos que interaccionaren a la conca diapírica del CHA durant el rift Juràssic i el subseqüent període post rift, utilitzant una metodologia multidisciplinària que integra treball de camp, models <b>analògics</b> i models numèrics. S’han estudiat dos dominis de la conca: no diapiric i diapiric (diapirisme durant el Juràssic Inferior i Mitjà). Els models <b>analògics</b> mostren que progradacions longitudinals i transversals i el moment quan s’inicien tenen un gran impacte en la migració dels nivells dúctils, en el mode de creixement diapiric i les seves variacions laterals. Els models amb compressió post-diapírica mostren que dita compressió produeix la reducció progressiva de l’amplada de les estructures diapíriques fins al seu tancament complet, així com a un increment dels cabussaments dels flancs com s’ha observat a les zones d’estudi. Les corbes de subsidència varien segons el domini analitzat. El domini no diapiric es caracteritza per un període llarg de baixes taxes de subsidència tectònica i total (0. 06 i 0. 08 mma- 1). El domini diapiric registra taxes de subsidència tectònica i total fins a un ordre de magnitud majors que en el domini no diapiric (0. 23 i 0. 90 mma- 1) i una migració dels depocentres subsidents. La subsidència del domini diapiric s’interpreta, durant el rift Juràssic Inferior, com una combinació d’activitat de falles normals i migració salina, sent aquesta darrera la predominant durant la fase post-extensiva i emmascarant el patró de subsidència esperat en un estadi de transició rift-post rift. Per primera vegada, es presenta la geohistòria de la part central del CHA. Els models tèrmics emprats per a la seva construcció, avaluats amb 27 noves dades de reflectància de vitrinites de la zona d’estudi, suggereixen una evolució post-Juràssic Mitjà caracteritzada per un període llarg de baixa subsidència que hauria enterrat la regió entre 1200 - 2400 m, en comptes de una complexa historia que inclouria diversos esdeveniments d’exhumació com s’ha enregistrat en altres zones del Alt Atles Marroquí...|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} the north-Iberian margin and the eastern sector of the Bay of Biscay suggest that these areas are ideal places to study and characterize the tectonic evolution and the geodynamic mechanisms governing {{the opening of the}} Atlantic Rift. This fact can be seen very well since several evolutionary stages have been preserved within the rifting system along the North-Iberian Margin. Similarly, the study of these lateral variations also reveals how they conditioned the subsequent development of the Pyrenean orogen. At a more specific level, the Bay of Biscay appears as a good place to understand how the processes of mantle exhumation and subsequent mantle accretion occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as to understand the role played by the resulting structures during the growth of the Pyrenean orogen. Furthermore, in its eastern sector, the Bay of Biscay allows the observation of the Mesozoic Parentis Basin slightly deformed by the Pyrenean compression. The study of this basin provides a first approach to understand how the Mesozoic basins were currently involved in the Pyrenean building previously to the Pyrenean compression (eg. Organyà Basin, Aulet Basin, etc…). These basins include highly deformed evaporitic materials from the Upper Triassic (Keuper facies) whose role during both the Mesozoic extension and the Cenozoic compression have been poorly studied. In this context, this thesis initially intended to elucidate how changes in the configuration of the crustal structure {{at the end of the}} Bay of Biscay opening have been able to control the change on structural style that took place from the Pyreness s. s. to the Cantabrian Pyrenees, to better understand the processes that governed the evolution of the Pyrenees. Second, at a smaller scale, this thesis aims to know which was the general structure of the Mesozoic intracontinental basins developed during the opening of the Bay of Biscay and which was its initial response during the Pyrenean compression. To achieve this goal we have analyzed several deep seismic surveys (ESCIN, ECORS and MARCONI) and the seismic data of the Parentis Basin. Apparently, the Mesozoic structure of this basin was slightly modified by the Pyrenean compression. In such asymmetric basin, salt tectonics has an important development and both its general structure and the salt structures have been poorly studied by the scientific community. In this sense, this thesis seeks to fill this gap pointing out the crustal fault structure of the Parentis Basin and establishing the style and the evolution of salt structures preserved in the basin. 1) Understanding the role played by the presence of a pre- or syn-kinematic salt level in the geometry and evolution of a thick-skinned extensional basin. 2) Determining the role played by the geometry of the main basin boundary faults in the formation of salt structures in its hangingwall during extension. 3) Investigating how salt structures developed during an extensional stage evolved with a subsequent contractional deformational stage which applied different degrees of shortening. The main results of the present thesis can be grouped into three action lines: 1) the characterization of structural variations along the Bay of Biscay-Pyrenean Rift System and its influence in the Pyrenean orogen development; 2) the definition of the Parentis Basin structure, in particular its western parts that were practically unknown; and 3) the analysis of the role played by the Upper Triassic pre-rift salt during both the extensional opening of the Bay of Biscay (specifically in the Parentis Basin) and the subsequent contractional development of the Pyrenean orogen. Aquesta tesi pretén aclarir com els canvis en la configuració de l’estructura cortical al final de l’obertura del Golf de Biscaia van controlar els canvis en l’estil estructural que tenen lloc des dels Pirineus en sentit estricte fins als Pirineus Cantàbrics per tal d’entendre millor els processos que van governar l’evolució d’aquest orogen. A més, i a una escala més petita, intenta conèixer quina era l’estructura general de les conques intracontinentals mesozoiques que es van desenvolupar durant l’obertura del Golf de Biscaia i quina va ser la seva resposta inicial durant la compressió pirinenca. Per tal d’assolir aquests objectius s’han analitzat diverses campanyes de sísmica profunda (ESCIN, ECORS i MARCONI) així com de sísmica petroliera disponible a la Conca de Parentis. També s’han realitzat diversos models <b>analògics</b> per tal de recolzar les interpretacions realitzades. L’estructura mesozoica de la Conca de Parentis va ser lleument modificada per la compressió pirinenca. Cal remarcar que la tectònica salina va tenir un paper molt important en el desenvolupament d’aquesta conca. D’altra banda, tant la seva estructura general com les estructures salines no havien estat objecte d’estudi per la comunitat científica fins a la realització d’aquesta tesi. En aquest sentit doncs, aquesta tesi omple aquest buit posant especial interès en les estructures corticals que controlen el seu desenvolupament i estableix l’estil i l’evolució de les estructures salines preservades en ella. Els resultats principals de la tesi es poden agrupar en tres línies principals: 1) la caracterització de les variacions estructurals al llarg del sistema de rift Golf de Biscaia - Pirineus i la seva influencia en el desenvolupament de l’orogen pirinenc; 2) la definició de l’estructura de la Conca de Parentis i en particular del seu sector occidental; i 3) l’anàlisi del paper que va jugar la salt pre-rift del Triàsic Superior tant durant l’obertura del Golf de Biscaia (especialment a la Conca de Parentis), com durant el desenvolupament contractiu de l’orogen pirinenc...|$|R
