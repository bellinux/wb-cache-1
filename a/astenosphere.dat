50|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} provides excellent explanations {{for both the}} existence of volcanic eruptions at plate boundaries such as ocean ridges and subduction zones and why geological processes produces basalts of different geochemical properties at these plate boundaries. The existence of basaltic eruptions {{in the interior of}} tectonic plates, however, are not directly related to plate tectonism and models involving magma upwelling from deep mantle sources, such as mantle plumes and hotspots have been developed to explain them. These models explain why OIBs contain more enriched basalt than mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) that originate much closer to the Earth's surface or in the <b>astenosphere.</b> The existence of mantle plumes and hotspots has, however, been hotly debated since they were first proposed in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

The spectral analysis has permitted usto determine periods of the main phases which make up the wave group. In regard to the longer period phase, which appears first in the recordings,the velocity obtained by the dromochrones equals 8. 4 Km/s. The groupvelocity is instead 7. 4 Km/s.

40|$|A {{multilayer}} {{model of}} the Earth to calculate finite element of time dependent deformation and stress following an earthquake on a strike slip fault is discussed. The model involves shear properties of an elastic upper lithosphere, a standard viscoelastic linear solid lower lithosphere, a Maxwell viscoelastic asthenosphere and an elastic mesosphere. Systematic variations of fault and layer depths and comparisons with simpler elastic lithosphere over viscoelastic asthenosphere calculations are analyzed. Both the creep of the lower lithosphere and <b>astenosphere</b> contribute to the postseismic deformation. The magnitude of the deformation is enhanced by a short distance between {{the bottom of the}} fault (slip zone) and the top of the creep region but is less sensitive to the thickness of the creeping layer. Postseismic restressing is increased as the lower lithosphere becomes more viscoelastic, but the tendency for the width of the restressed zone to growth with time is retarded...|$|E
40|$|The sub-continental lithospheric {{mantle of}} South America {{has been known}} for some time to carry the DUPAL isotope anomaly as seen in {{volcanic}}s from the Paraná volcanic province. However, this has not allowed discriminating whether the DUPAL anomaly is a primary feature of the mantle source or acquired during the upwelling and emplacement of the primary magmas. We discovered mantle xenoliths from the Tres Lagos location in Patagonia that carry evidence of percolation by metasomatic melts that imparted the DUPAL isotope anomaly signature. We discuss a model that requires four isotope components (LCC, EM 2, HIMU and DM) to account for the Sr, Nd and Pb isotope variability of our samples. We propose that upwelling of hot <b>astenosphere</b> during the Miocene could have triggered the melting of the LCC and EM 2 components carrying the DUPAL anomaly, previously entrained in the subcontinental mantle by subduction. These ascending melts would have then metasomatised the local SCLM characterised by DMM and HIMU geochemical affinity generating the hybrid DUPAL-bearing mantle sampled by the Tres Lagos xenoliths...|$|E
40|$|It {{had been}} {{observed}} by Linkov, Petrova and Osipov (1992) that there exist periodic 4 - 6 hours pulses of 200 microHz seismogravitational oscillations (SGO) before 95 % of powerful earthquakes. We explain this by beating between an oscillation eigenmode {{of a whole}} tectonic plate and a local eigenmode of an active zone. The beating transfers the oscillation energy from the remote zone of the tectonic plate to the active zone, triggering the earthquake. Oscillation frequencies of the plate and ones of the active zone are tuned to a resonance by an additional compression applied to the active zone due to collision of neighboring plates or the magma flow in the liquid underlay of the <b>astenosphere</b> (the upper mantle). In the case when there are three or more SGO with incommensurable difference frequencies the SGO beating pattern looks quasi-random, thus masking the non-random nature of the beating process. Nevertheless, {{we are able to}} discuss a possibility of the short term earthquakes predictions based on an accurate monitoring of the beating dynamics.

40|$|The {{lithosphere}} of Iberia {{has been}} formed {{through a number}} of processes of continental collision and extension: in Lower Paleozoic, the collision of three tectonics blocks produced the Variscan Orogeny, the main event of formation of the lithosphere. The subsequent Mesozoic rifting and breakup of the Pangea {{had a profound effect on}} the continental crust of Iberia. Since the Miocene, the southern interaction between Africa and Iberia is characterized by a diffuse convergent margin that originates a vast area of deformation. The impact of this complex tectonic in the structure of the Lithosphere remains an incognito, especially in its western part. Project WILAS (PTDC/CTE-GIX/ 097946 / 2008) is a 3 years project funded by FCT in which a temporary network of more than 20 BB seismic stations is being deployed in Portugal between 2010 - 2012. It will extend to the western border of Iberia the coverage of the TOPO-IBERIA project. The project aims to image the 3 D structure beneath W Iberia.

40|$|Resolution of {{both the}} extent and {{mechanism}} of lateral heterogeneity in the upper mantle constraints the nature and scales of mantle convection. Oceanic regions are of particular interest as {{they are likely to}} provide the closest glimpse at the patterns of temperature anomalies and convective flow in the upper mantle because of their young age and simple crustal structure relative to continental regions. Lateral variations were determined in the seismic velocity and attenuation structure of the lithosphere and <b>astenosphere</b> beneath the oceans, and these seismological observations were combined with the data and theory of geoid and bathymetry anomalies in order to test and improve current models for seafloor spreading and mantle convection. Variations were determined in mantle properties on a scale of about 1000 km, comparable to the thickness of the upper mantle. Seismic velocity, geoid, and bathymetry anomalies are all sensitive to variations in upper mantle density, and inversions were formulated to combine quantitatively these different data and to search for a common origin. Variations in mantle density can be either of thermal or compositional origin and are related to mantle convection or differentiation...|$|E
40|$|In situ trace-element and isotopic (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) {{data and}} whole-rock Sr–Nd–Hf data on 12 gabbro xenoliths from the Hyblean Plateau (south-eastern Sicily) {{illustrate}} the complex petrogenetic evolution of this lithospheric segment. The gabbros formed by precipitation of plagioclase + clinopyroxene from a HIMU-type alkaline melt, then were cryptically metasomatized by a low-Rb, high-⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr fluid, and finally infiltrated by an exotic, late Fe–Ti-rich melt with ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ~ 0. 7055, carrying {{high concentrations of}} Sr, Rb and HFSE. The geochemical and isotopic features of both the metasomatizing fluid and the Fe–Ti-rich melt are compatible with their common derivation by the progressive melting of an amphibole–phlogopite–ilmenite metasomatic domain (MARID-type?) that probably resided within the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Therefore, both the <b>astenosphere</b> and the lithosphere underneath the Hyblean Plateau contributed to the petrogenesis of the gabbros. Sm–Nd dating yields an age of 253 ± 60 Ma for the cumulitic pile, roughly coinciding with a hydrothermal event recorded by crustal zircons in the area. We suggest that the Hyblean Plateau suffered a thermal event—probably related to lithospheric thinning and upwelling and melting of the asthenosphere—in Permo-Triassic time (the opening of the Ionian Basin?). The induced perturbation in the lithosphere caused consequent melting of some previously metasomatised portions. 22 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropy is {{a common}} {{property}} of the Earth's crust and the upper mantle; it {{is related to the}} strain field of the medium and therefore to geodynamics. In this paper we describe the different possible origins of anisotropic behavior of the seismic waves and the seismological techniques used to define anisotropic bodies. In general it is found that the fast polarization direction is parallel to the absolute plate motion in cratonic areas, to the spreading direction near rifts or extensional zones, and to the main structural features in transpressive regimes. The delay times between fast and slow waves reflect the relative strength and penetration at depth of the deformation field. The correspondence between surface structural trends and anisotropy in the upper mantle, found in many regions of the world, strongly suggest that orogenic processes involve not only the shallow crust but the entire lithosphere. Recently in Italy both shear wave splitting analysis and Pn inversion were applied to define the trend of seismic anisotropy. Along the Northern Appeninic arc fast directions follow the strike of the arc (i. e., parallel to the strike of the Miocene-Pleistocene compressional features), whereas in the Tyrrhenian zone fast directions are about E-W SW-NE; parallel to the post-Miocene extension that is thought to have reoriented the mantle minerals fabric in the <b>astenosphere...</b>|$|E
40|$|The crustal {{structure}} in Western Iberia, {{is the result}} of a complex geodynamic history. Most of the surface is covered by rocks dating to the Variscan orogeny, the coastal ranges dominated by Mesozoic structures and Mesocenozoic basins covering partially the mainland. In this study we present the results of a local earthquake tomographic study, performed to image in depth this complex crustal structure down to 24 km depth. The obtained tomograms present a good correlation with the surface geology, in general with higher Vp velocities in the north, and lower Vp velocities in the south. The heterogeneity observed on the surface geology of the Galicia-Tras-os-Montes Zone is well marked, being a relatively thin layer over the smoother structure of the Centro Iberia Zone CIZ. The CIZ crustal block confined between the Porto-Tomar-Ferreira do Alentejo and the Manteigas-Bragança faults having higher Vp values, enhancing the contrast to the Lusitanian Basin to the west. The Ossa-Morena Zone corresponds to the unit presenting the greater heterogeneity in both Vp and Vp/Vs models, showing also with a complex transition to the South Portuguese Zone and a relatively smooth transition to the Centro Iberian Zone. Unexpectedly, the South Portuguese Zone present an east-west velocity variation with no apparent correspondence with the surface geology. The transition to the coastal Mesocenozoic basins is clearly marked, the Lower Tagus Valley corresponding to a 4 km thick low velocity region. The relocation inland recorded seismicity in the period 2000 – 2014 allows cleansing some of the alignments and establish their correlation with some of the active structures in Portugal.

40|$|December 2013. A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Eric Sandvol. Vita. This dissertation focuses on two specific research topics: First, I study the lithospheric structure beneath E. Tibetan Plateau, using new data from INDEPTH-IV (INternational Deep Profiling of Tibet and the Himalayas) seismic experiment. I show new shear wave tomographic maps, {{in order to better}} constrain the existing geodynamic models regarding the growth and dynamics of the region. In the second part, I investigate seismic resolution capabilities of the two-plane wave method using synthetic seismograms. Further, I modify and apply this approach to Love waves. My shear wave tomography results indicate that subhorizontal underthrusting of the Indian plate beneath E. Tibet does not extend much further north of Bangong-Nijuang Suture. Moreover, my tomographic images clearly show that the Indian lithosphere is laterally torn into at least two fragments. The westernmost fragment is detached {{from the rest of the}} Indian plate, and vertically sinking into the <b>astenosphere.</b> Azimuthal fast directions are consistent at depth beneath the central part of the study region, suggesting vertically coherent deformation of crust and uppermost mantle. Further, I observe low velocity zones along the northern and southern branches of the Kunlun fault, and I attribute these zones to strain heating due to ductile deformation. Moreover, these low velocity zones below the Kunlun Shan are continuous at depth, providing evidence against a present southward continental subduction or underthrusting. One of the most important limitations of seismic tomography studies is spatial resolution of applied methods. To determine the resolution of my tomographic models, I calculate synthetic seismograms for ideally isotropic checkerboard earth models, and apply two-plane wave tomography. My results prove that SV anomalies smaller than the dominant wavelength of surface waves can be recovered down to ? 200 km, wheretraditional approaches break down. For Love waves, a modified version of the approach is required, incorporating two perpendicular components for two plane wave solutions along x and y directions of the local coordinate system. Moreover, the method exhibits adequate resolution for SH waves down to ? 100 km. Smearing is more evident in SH results due to shallower depth sensitivity and longer wavelengths of Love waves than Rayleigh waves. Includes bibliographical references...|$|E
40|$|The {{genesis of}} the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP) has been {{associated}} to the melting of the Galapagos plume head at ~ 90 Ma or to {{the interaction between the}} plume and the Caribbean slab window. Gorgona Island, offshore western Colombia, is an accreted fragment of the CLIP and its highly heterogeneous igneous suite, ranging from enriched basalts to depleted komatiites and picrites, was assumed to have formed at ~ 89 Ma from different part of the plume. Herewepresent new geologic, geochronologic and geochemical data ofGorgona with significant implications for the formation of the CLIP. A new set of 40 Ar??? 39 Ar ages documents a magmatic activity spanning the whole Late Cretaceous (98. 7 ± 7. 7 to 64. 4 ± 5 Ma) followed by a shallower, picritic pyroclastic eruption in the Paleocene. Trace element and isotope geochemistry confirm the existence of an enriched (EDMM: La/SmN ??? 1 and ??Ndi of 5. 7 to 7. 8) and a depleted (DMM: La/SmNb 1 and ??Ndi of 9. 5 to 11. 3) mantle sources. A progressive increase in the degree of melting and melt extraction with time occurred in both groups. Petrologic modelling indicates that low but variable degrees of wet melting (b 5 %) of an EDMM can produce the LREEenriched rocks. Higher degree of melting (N 10 %) of a mixedDMM+EDMM(40 to 60 %) may reproduce themore depleted rocks with temperatures in the range of ambient mantle in absence of plumes. Our results contradict the notion that the CLIP formed by melting of a plume head at ~ 90 Ma. Multiple magmatic pulses over several tens of Ma in small areas like Gorgona, also recognised in other CLIP areas, suggest a long period of diffuse magmatism without a clear pattern of migration. The age span of this magmatism is broadly concurrent with the Caribbean slab window. During this time span the Farallon oceanic lithosphere (later becoming the Caribbean plate) advanced eastward ~ 1500 km, overriding the <b>astenosphere</b> feeding the proto-Caribbean spreading ridge. This hotter mantle flowed westward into, and mixed with, the opening mantle wedge, promoting increasing melting with time. The fortuitous occurrence of a plume passing through the slab gap area cannot be excluded but not required to produce the observed composition and degree of melting...|$|E
40|$|European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2013, 7 - 12 April, Vienna, AustriaThe Purana Basins {{are unique}} feature of Proterozoic geology of Indian Peninsular Shield that include almost un-deformed and un-metamorphosed sediments that occupy more than 20 % {{of the area}} of Precambrian exposures. Among the seven Proterozoic basins in India, Bhima basin is the {{youngest}} (600 ma) and its deeper structures are the least studied geophysically. The sediments occupy an area of less than 5000 sq km 	the lithosequence is essentially constituted of limestone units of undisturbed horizontal beds. The basin {{is located on the}} northern edges of Eastern Dharwar craton comprising Peninsular Gneissic Complex, intrusive granitoids and a series of subparallel greenstone belts. The initiation of Bhima basin was related to regional tectonism related to Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) and Mid-Proterozoic Mobile Belt (MPMB) orogeny. To the North of the Bhima basin is finalized by the volcanic units of the Deccan Traps. Magnetotelluric studies were undertaken across this basin for estimating thickness of the sediments and crustal structure of the Eastern Dharwar Craton that underlie the sediments. Data were collected at 33 stations along three NNE-SSW profiles with station spacing of 10 km in the frequency range 100 - 0. 001 Hz. The data were processed using a remote reference robust code. Dimensionality analysis shows different strike angles for shallow structures (20 degrees) and deeper structures (- 55 degrees). This difference can probably be {{explained by the fact that}} the strike angle of the crustal units shows the amalgamation direction of the Bhima basin within the Indian continent. On the other hand, the mantle units show the direction of the motion of the Indian plate and probably also respond to the thermal events that have affected the Indian lithosphere since Archaean times. For the interpretation of the data, we have undertaken 3 D inversion of the measured responses. The models show a resistive upper crust in which there are several conductive anomalies, allowing to follow the northwestern extent of the Adoni shear zone, only mapped on the surface. The lower crust and upper mantle of the Bhima basins are fairly resistive, showing a quite homogeneous regional structure under the Deccan Traps, suggesting that the East Dharwar craton has continuation under the volcanics. Finally the electrical <b>astenosphere</b> has been located at about 140 km to the southeast of the study area (south-east of the Bhima basin) and 160 km to the northwest.

40|$|The Ural Mountains {{of central}} Russia {{separate}} the ancient core of Europe, the East European Craton, {{from the more}} easterly terranes of Siberia and Kazahkstan. Together with the Caledonian, Appalachian and Variscian orogenic belts, the Urals compose the Paleozoic framework of the old craton. Todays Mountains are largely a Tertiary feature. The Uralide orogen extends far eastwards, forming {{the basement of the}} Mesozoic hydrocarbon bearing formations of the West Siberian Basin. The 3000 km long mountain belt is a unique natural laboratory with many key features that are important for our understanding of Paleozoic collisional orogeny. Comparison of the Uralides with the other related Paleozoic orogens will provide new insight into the processes of pre-Mesozoic plate tectonics. The existing database indicates the Urals are remarkable for their preservation of a continental root, the orogen having apparently suffered less post-orogenic collapse than most other Paleozoic mountain belts. Nevertheless, extension must have contributed significantly to the preservation throughout the belt of some of the world's most complete ophiolites and island-arc volcanic suites (along with associated mineralizations), juxtaposed over very high-P blueschists and eclogites. Other Paleozoic orogens have been re-equilibrated to normal crustal thicknesses during late- to post-orogenic processes. Such mechanisms of uplift and extension are also demonstrated in young orogens (e. g. Himalaya, Alps). The existence or appearant preservation of a thickened crust beneath the Uralides represents a fundamental problem in the understanding of orogenic processes. The young history of the Urals, following extensive Mesozoic transgression and erosion, is of particular interest in view of the reportedly high (2 mm/yr) uplift rates and widespread evidence of Tertiary (Recent?) tectonism. Historical seismicity is reported to be concentrated to the Middle Urals, apparently related to a compressional stress regime. Establishing the relationship of the crustal roots to deep structures in the subcrustal lithosphere and <b>astenosphere</b> and understanding the development of these major structures in time is fundamental for full interpretations of the dynamic evolution of the Urals. A wide range of new interdisciplinary investigations of the Uralide orogen are proposed here {{in the form of a}} collaborative European-American initiative, the scope of which has never been previously attempted for the continental lithosphere. Geoscientists from institutions all over Europe will work together with N. I. S. colleagues on key aspects of the mountain belt.

40|$|Sardinia {{represents}} a southern transect of the Variscan Belt and is classically divided from SW to NE into a fold and thrust belt Foreland, Nappe zone and Axial zone. This latter high-grade domain {{is separated from}} the Nappe zone by the so-called Posada-Asinara Line. The whole metamorphic basement is intruded by many calc-alkaline coalescent plutons forming the Corsica-Sardinia Batholith. The timing of magmatism, in Sardinia, is broadly referable to a large interval {{in the range of}} 320 - 280 Ma. Recent geological maps coupled to several chronological systematics, point out to recognize two main post-collisional magmatic peaks clustered at about 305 Ma (Older Magmatic Peak, OMP) and at 285 Ma (Young Magmatic Peak, YMP), respectively. Plutons intruding different parts of the Sardinian basement show different geological styles. Among the OMP, main differences regard: (a) the granodiorite/granite volume ratio in the main plutons; (b) the abundance of peraluminous rock-types; (c) the occurrence of mafic intrusions; (d) the abundance of late-magmatic dyke swarms. The Axial zone is dominated by monzogranites and subordinate granodiorites and leucogranites (320 - 307 Ma); tonalites and granodiorites (305 - 300 Ma), along with peraluminous granites, characterize the inner Nappe zone (i. e., Goceano, Baronie, Barbagia). Remarkably, the oldest intrusions (i. e., Barrabisa and Santa Maria: 320 Ma) are foliated and may represent a prebatholith magmatic phase. Plutons occurring in the external Nappe zone and the Foreland are generally dominated by granodiorites (e. g., Arbus, Ogliastra, Sàrrabus: 305 - 300 Ma) associated to small gabbronoritic bodies. The YMP is marked in the Axial zone by large leucogranite intrusions (Monte Lerno); gabbroic intrusions are present at 285 - 280 Ma. The YMP is dominant in the external Nappe zone and in the Foreland. This peak include monzogranites and leucogranites with minor granodiorites; specific characters are: (a) common occurrence of F-bearing, ferroan, ilmeniteseries granitoids; (b) slightly peraluminous character; (c) very shallow emplacement levels, with common greisen alteration; (d) presence of Sn-W-Mo and F ores; (e) association to swarms of tholeiitic mafic dikes. The timing and distribution of Sardinian intrusive magmatism are tentatively framed during the post-collisional evolution of the chain, in response to progressive lithospheric delamination along a N-S direction. In this model, the passive upwelling of hot <b>astenosphere</b> triggered dehydration melting at lower to intermediate crustal levels, associated with minor melting of the lithospheric mantle. Several major issues emerge from this schematic picture, including (a) the precise timing of the magmatic peaks, (b) the significance of the gap between them, (c) the difference in volumes and spatial distribution of the main rock-suites, (d) the geological and petrological frame at the district- to single pluton-, up to regional scale, and (e) the age of mafic dyke swarms...|$|E
40|$|The Azores archipelago, located {{close to}} the triple {{junction}} where the Eurasian, African and American plates meet, {{is an example of}} plume related magmatism. Mantle plumes have been the locus of an intense debate. Their ultimate origin has been assigned to the D” layer, to the bottom of transition zone and even to the <b>astenosphere,</b> as the result of passive response to lithosphere cracking (e. g. Courtillot et al., 2003). He isotope geochemistry is a key tool to clear up this question given its ability to identify the incorporation of relatively undegassed lower mantle portions in plumes (with 4 He/ 3 He ratios as low as 20. 000 or R/Ra= 32) and to distinguish them from those generated in a degassed upper mantle generally accepted as the MORB source (with constant 4 He/ 3 He ratios around 90. 000 or R/Ra 8; e. g. Allègre et al., 1995). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the two mantle reservoirs expected from helium isotope systematics can be substantiated by neon data (Moreira et Allègre, 1998). In this work we present the first Ne isotopic data collected from Terceira samples; these data, in addition to new He isotope determinations, are used to better constrain the origin of the Azores mantle plume. The noble gases analyses were performed at IPG in Paris by crushing of olivine phenocrysts (~ 1 g). This method is particularly useful for measuring the mantle gases released by melt inclusions trapped inside the olivine crystals. Terceira island comprises four main strato-volcanoes (Self, 1976) : Cinco Picos, Guilherme Moniz, Pico Alto and Santa Bárbara. At least the later two are considered to be active and connected by a fissure zone regarded by some authors as the Terceira rift (e. g. Udías, 1980). One of the oldest features of the island is expressed by the Cinco Picos caldera (7 km in diameter) that should be younger than 300. 000 years (K/Ar data from Feraud et al., 1980). Previous studies have shown that Terceira lavas combine relatively high radiogenic lead isotopic signatures typical from HIMU basalts (206 Pb/ 204 Pb up to 20. 02) and slight primitive He signatures, with 63780 as a minimum value of 4 He/ 3 He ratio (R/Ra= 11. 3; Dupré et al., 1982; Moreira et al., 1999). A lower value of 48821 (R/Ra= 14. 8) was now obtained, strengthening the contribution of lower mantle to Terceira magmas. Our results also suggest a stratigraphic control on the variation of He isotopic signatures since the most primitive values appear to be confined to the most ancient rocks. In fact, values lower than 68814 (R/Ra ratios higher than 10, 5) were found in one lava collected near the village of Säo Sebastiäo (SE of Terceira, {{in one of the most}} eroded landscape of the island) and in samples from the lower levels of a 20 m thick lava flow sequence exposed in the actual sea cliff near the village of Santa Bárbara (SW of Terceira). At least for the later samples, we exclude the possibility of a cosmogenic 3 He contribution since this sequence is exposed in a relatively recent erosion surface. Our results raise important questions concerning the evolution of the Açores plume; several interpretations seems to be plausible, as the changing with time of the source isotopic signature or the increase of mixing with a MORB. These hypothesis will be better constrained in future works. Some of the analysed samples show higher 20 Ne/ 22 Ne and 21 Ne/ 22 Ne ratios than air suggesting the presence of a mantle component in the olivine melt inclusions. Moreover, in a three-Ne isotope diagram, the samples define a trend with a higher slope than the MORB line (e. g. Sarda et al., 1988). The Terceira trend is then interpreted as a mixing line between an atmospheric component and a mantle component with a solar like 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio and with a 21 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio of 0. 052 (extrapolated to solar). This value is in accord with the mantle mixing model predicted by the 4 He/ 3 He- 21 Ne/ 22 Ne relationship (Moreira et al., 2001) and is also strongly suggestive of a lower mantle contribution to Terceira magmas...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the backarc mantle lithosphere in Patagonia has shown that it suffered a regional, pervasive, re-crystallisation and that the regions {{to the north and}} south of the latitude of the actual triple point (40 ° 30 ’) between the Antartctica, Nazca and South America plate present important differences in the regional distribution of metasomatic components. Subduction of the Chile ridge is believed to have induced an interruption in the subducting plate (slab window, D’ 0 razio et al. 2001, Gorring and Kay, 2001), upraise and melting of the sub-slab <b>astenosphere,</b> producing the abundant plateau and postplateu OIB like lavas, which record slab component only in the westernmost occurrences (Stern et al., 1990). The Cerro de los Chenques locality occurs immediately {{to the north of the}} latitude of the Triple point, it overlays the subducted Nazca plate and occurs at the edge of the putative slab window. It is, therefore, of especial importance for revealing the processes and constraining the metasomatic components of the mantle wedge in a complex geotectonic situation. Xenoliths occurring in alkaline lavas are predominately granular to porphyroblastic spinel-facies lherzolites, being harzburgites and dunites less abundant. They do not contain hydrous phases, but may contain trace amounts of glass derived from infiltration of the host basalt. They record equilibrium temperature in the range of 900 - 1100 °C. Bulk-rock and mineral phases exhibit major element variation trends apparently consistent with melting and melt removal processes. This is also the case for moderately incompatible elements (e. g. HREE) in bulk rock and clinopyroxene, but not for highly incompatible elements. In lherzolites, clinopyroxene varies from moderately LREE depleted (Cen/Ybn 0. 26 – 0. 91) to moderately LREE-enriched (Cen/Ybn up to 2. 6), being the REE pattern virtually flat in the range Eu – Lu at a 2 to 5 xPM concentration level. Harzburgitic clinopyroxene is LREE-enriched and the whole REE pattern varies from U-shaped to steadily fractionated (Cen/Ybn 14. 4) In dunite, cpx is slightly LREE enriched. All the pyroxenes are enriched in Th, U and La with respect to Nb and Ta and depleted in Ti and Pb with respect to Gd and Ce, respectively. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr value in clinopyroxene ranges 0. 70279 – 0. 70423 and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd 0. 51279 – 0. 51349. In the Sr-Nd isotope diagram, clinopyroxenes constitute a tight array (R 2 = 0. 79) between a highly depleted end-member and a component enriched in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr with respect to BE. The C. Chenques array runs at higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr than the field of the Gobernador Gregores xenoliths and it is followed also by the xenoliths from P. Indios and E. Alvares (northern Patagonia) and Fraile and Cumbres (south of the volcanic gap). It is also on line at the enriched side with the isotope values of the C. Pampa, Lautaro and Aguilera adakites (those closest to the present occurrence). Isotope variations correlate with bulk-rock and cpx composition, so that the increase of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr correlates in cpx with an increase of the Mg# value and Sr, Zr, LREE, Pb, Th and U concentrations and with the decrease of Na, Fe, Ti, V, Y, Nb and HREE concentrations. Obviously the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd variation with respect to the geochemical parameters has the opposite behaviour of Sr. Assuming higher porosity in depleted peridotites, these data may indicate that a metasomatic agent affected a mantle that suffered previous variable depletion, being the amount of the metasomatic component proportional to the depletion. Alternatively, the variation trends may indicate melting triggered by the addition of a metasomatic agent and removal of the resulting hybrid melt. The increase of the highly incompatible element concentrations with increasing isotope fertility favours the first possibility. The trace element - isotope relationships reveal that the added component was enriched in LILE, LREE, Zr and depleted in Nb and Ti. These are characteristics expected in components derived from the subducting slab. The similarity of the potential melts estimated from clinopyroxene with the Patagonia arc magmas supports this conclusion. More detailed information on the composition of the subducted plate is provided by the correlations of isotopes with Th/La, Pb/U, Ce/Pb, Nb/U and Zr/Hf, showing that the metasomatic component was enriched in Pb with respect to U, in Ce with respect to Pb, in Th with respect to La, thus suggesting contribution of altered oceanic crust, pelagic sediments and, possibly, continental detritus components occurring in the trench. However, Klein and Karsten (1995) have documented the occurrence of Chile ridge basalts having arc-like geochemistry. Subduction of the Nazca plate related to one of these segments may control the composition of the metasomatic agent...|$|E
