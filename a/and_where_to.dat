5|$|On September 10, British troops {{moved from}} Long Island to occupy Montresor's Island, {{a small island}} {{at the mouth of}} the Harlem River. One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours. The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was not authorized to grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on.

5|$|The {{first film}} in J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), which was {{followed}} by seven Harry Potter sequels, beginning with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002, and ending with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011, nearly {{ten years after the}} first film's release. Fantastic Beasts <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>to</b> Find Them (2016) is the first film in the spin-off Fantastic Beasts series. A sequel to Fantastic Beasts <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>to</b> Find Them has been scheduled for 2018, alongside three additional instalments with one scheduled for 2020.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Strange earned $32.6 {{million on}} its opening {{day in the}} United States and Canada, {{including}} Thursday previews, with a total weekend gross of $85.1 million; IMAX contributed $12.2 million to the opening weekend gross, with 3D contributing $24 million. The film was the number one film for the weekend, and became the second largest opening in November for Disney. Initial projections for the film in late August 2016 had it earning as low as $50 million to as high as $88 million in its opening weekend, with projections revised to $65–75 million closer to the film's release. Doctor Strange remained the top film in its second weekend, and fell to second in its third, behind Fantastic Beasts <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>to</b> Find Them. In its fourth weekend, Doctor Strange was the third highest-grossing film, behind Fantastic Beasts and Moana. It fell to fifth in its fifth and sixth weekends, and by its seventh weekend had fallen to the ninth-highest-grossing place. It was projected to earn $255 million for its total domestic gross.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors– cookery {{writer and}} TV {{presenter}} Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling– to submit booklets {{related to their}} most famous works for publication. Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>to</b> Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7million for the fund. The £10.8million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis. In 2002 Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping {{to raise money for}} the National Council for One Parent Families.|$|E
