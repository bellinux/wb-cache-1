5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

He wrote that every measure should have been taken to prevention the worst outcome, but that had not been done thoroughly. There was some psychological confrontation between the [...] police leadership and the leadership of the Civil Secret Police.

So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way.
