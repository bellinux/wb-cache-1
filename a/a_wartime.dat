The notable refits to the Mahan class included the removal of one 5-inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns (1.6in) and between four and six 20 mm Oerlikon (0.9in) guns to increase the ships' light anti-aircraft (AA) armament.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing <b>a</b> <b>wartime</b> blackout exercise.|$|E
5|$|All this time, Bradbury {{remained}} nominally {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under <b>a</b> <b>wartime</b> contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work. Named for <b>a</b> <b>wartime</b> quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many of the topics were still classified and he was denied access to British war records.

5|$|During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was {{prevented}} from ordering an improved {{version of the}} preceding s by <b>a</b> <b>wartime</b> restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915. To obtain ships suitable for the doctrinal roles of battlecruisers, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Cowan was {{appointed}} player-manager at Mossley. He led {{the club to}} the seventh place in the Cheshire League and to the Manchester Challenge Shield title.

In October 1945, a shortage of players resulted in Cowan taking to the field in <b>a</b> <b>wartime</b> match against Bournemouth. Aged 44 years and 156 days, he became the oldest ever Brighton player. While at Brighton, Cowan started a physiotherapy business based near the Goldstone Ground.|$|E
