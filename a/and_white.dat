5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours {{are blue}} <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> {{although they have}} played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped jerseys <b>and</b> <b>white</b> shorts, they experimented with red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes <b>and</b> <b>white</b> shorts. They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{played in}} an all blue strip from their {{formation}} until 1884, when they adopted a red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes in the 1887–88 season. Their badge included a ship, {{the upper part}} of the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes. In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes.|$|E

Specifically, blacks scored {{an average of}} 239 points, <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> scored an average of 291 points on the NAEP reading tests in 1971. In 1990, blacks scored an average of 267, <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> scored an average of 297 points. On NAEP math tests in 1973, blacks scored an average of 270, <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> scored 310. In 1990, black average score was 289 <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> scored an average of 310 points.

5|$|West Brom {{have played}} in navy blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped shirts for the {{majority}} of their existence, usually with white shorts <b>and</b> <b>white</b> socks. The team is occasionally referred to as the Stripes by supporters. A number of different colours were trialled during the club's formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880–81, yellow <b>and</b> <b>white</b> quarters in 1881–82, chocolate and blue halves in 1881–82 and 1882–83, red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> hoops in 1882–83, chocolate <b>and</b> <b>white</b> in 1883–84 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884–85. The blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes made their first appearance in the 1885–86 season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War. For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{will explore}} the {{connection}} between Iris Murdoch <b>and</b> Patrick <b>White's</b> 'religious' <b>and</b> moral thinking as manifested in their novels. It begins by {{considering the importance of}} the quotidian in the work of both authors as the focus of attention in an increasingly secular age, in contrast to the work of existentialists, in particular, Jean-Paul Sartre, who view both a central moral framework and the quotidian as unnecessary. I will focus upon Murdoch's The Time of the Angels, in which, I will argue, her positioning of the quotidian within morality is most evident, <b>and</b> <b>White's</b> Voss, which challenges the existentialists' contempt for the quotidian. The thesis moves on to consider the similarities between Murdoch <b>and</b> <b>White's</b> emphasis on the importance of attempting to be a good person and will explore what 'being good' means to both authors. The discussion will centre upon Murdoch's The Good Apprentice <b>and</b> <b>White's</b> The Solid Mandala and A Fringe of Leaves. Finally, I will explore Murdoch <b>and</b> <b>White's</b> emphasis upon the importance of retaining the concept of Christ as a human being for secular use as an example of goodness. The core texts for this chapter are Murdoch's Nuns <b>and</b> Soldiers <b>and</b> <b>White's</b> Riders in the Chariot and Voss...|$|R

5|$|During World War II, {{the design}} of the jersey was {{modified}} because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort. This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys, and the single red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.|$|E

Because of this influence, the red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E

In 1996–97, the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back.|$|E
