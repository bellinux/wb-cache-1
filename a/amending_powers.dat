40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{whether and}} to what extent constitutions, and their constitutional law more generally, make provision for secession. More broadly put, the question is what place secession has, or should have under municipal constitutional law. The two aspects of the question naturally are different in focus and intent. Whether secession has a place under any constitutional system depends very much on the text of any given constitutional document and the current body of constitutional law and norms. It is principally a factual enquiry, a matter for descriptive jurisprudence. Whether secession should figure in some way in a constitution or the constitutional law and norms is more speculative an enquiry, bordering on politics, legal theory, constitutional theory, and like matters, and pertains more to analytic jurisprudence. The two are nonetheless conjoined inasmuch as the subsuming of secession under a constitutional system in the absence of express provisions therefor depends in a large measure on what analytic stance we take on constitutional and legal theory, and on what a constitution, generally and in particular, should address. Now obviously, the two sides of this single issues are related, insofar as the first draws upon norms and principles to inform – implicitly – constitutional and relevant law, and the second upon the constitution and law as practical framework or instantiation of the norms and principles. This suggests that in constitutional theory, secession should be conceived less as purely some institutional re-arranging inside or outside the current institutional and regulatory framework. Similarly, a constitution should be conceived less as purely a template or map of state, and more as institutional architecture, namely the building of institutions to strengthen and develop the moral foundations of a society. We take the position in this thesis that secession is indeed a matter appropriate for constitutional law, and is governed thereby. Whilst secession provisions are not and should not be incorporated expressly into a constitution the process of secession is certainly subject to constitutional law and norms. Some inroad to a full grasp of this position (but not its implications) has already been forged by the Supreme Court of Canada, in the Québec Secession Reference. As such, and to the extent outlined below, secession, as an element of constitutional law, engages the courts at least on that basis, insofar as their jurisdiction permits. Accordingly, secession is more than a purely political (TABLE OF CONTENTS Volume 1 Foreword	 i Table of Contents 	 ii Samenvatting	 vii Chapter 1 THE JUSTICIABILITY OF SECESSION? 1.

40|$|MOST treatises on {{constitutional}} law {{dispose of the}} federal amending clause in summary fashion. The commentators have thought fit to stress chiefly the division of authority between {{the federal government and}} the states. They have attached a high degree of significance to the dogma of separation of powers. A great deal of attention has been devoted to the doctrines of judicial review, the supremacy of the Federal Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. The taxation and the commerce clauses have come in for their full share of consideration. In recent years extensive studies have been made of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result, the amendment clause has almost been lost sight of. No monograph on Article Five has been published prior to the present book. Yet when one stops to realize that the subjects just referred to have to do only with the existing distribution of powers, and that the operation of the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> may bring about a complete reshuflling of the Constitution, it becomes obvious that one is dealing with a power of a higher grade and of more potential importance than any other power provided for in the Constitution. One may approach the study of the amending clause from at least three different points of view: from that of constitutional law, from that of jurisprudence and legal philosophy, and from that of political science and legislation. From the standpoint of constitutional law the genesis and justiciability of the power may be considered; the procedure of amendment may be examined in detail; and the scope of the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> may be analyzed. From the point of jurisprudence, the relation of the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> to the concept of sovereignty may be developed. Finally, from the standpoint of political science and legislation, the reform of the amending process itself may be made the basis of investigation. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the landscape of Parliamentary Supremacy of south asian countries, members of parliament often cross their limit by thinking parliament as a sovereign body to make unnecessary constitutional amendments which are ultimately questioned by the courts. As a member of the legislative department, I unmasked the reasons behind this unauthorized exercise of power to stop the mockery of parliamentary democracy. Supreme Courts in south Asia are often asked to judge constitutionality of constitutional amendments which provides them with the opportunity to engage with the noble issue of ‘constitutional limits on parliamentary amending power’. Constitutional courts and commentators have always recognized some short of constitutional limits on parliament’s <b>power</b> to <b>amend</b> the constitution, though the nature and scope of such limits have been a matter of controversy.

40|$|In the post-secession {{winter of}} 1861, both Houses of Congress {{approved}} a proposed thirteenth {{amendment to the}} U. S. Constitution. Three northern States even ratified the proposal before the Civil War intervened. That version of the thirteenth amendment, introduced in the House by Representative Thomas Corwin of Ohio, purported to prohibit any future amendment granting Congress power to interfere with slavery in the States. The Congressional Globe volumes for the winter 1861 legislative session include rich debates about whether the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> {{could be used to}} limit future exercise of that same authority. Those forgotten debates offer significant insights for modern controversies about the exclusivity of, and limitations on, the extraordinary power granted in Article V of the U. S. Constitution. Recent years have witnessed an outpouring of academic writing on the <b>amending</b> <b>power.</b> Salient examples of this scholarship are the works of Yale Law School Professors Bruce Ackerman and Akhil Amar, who have raised distinct challenges to the claim that Article V constitutes the sole legitimate means for constitutional revision. Their imaginative and controversial work has in turn prompted vigorous debate among constitutional scholars, political scientists, and historians about the role Article V can and should play in our constitutional order. As voluminous as the recent Article V scholarship has been, at least one fundamental question has gone virtually unnoticed: what, if anything, prevents or limits the use of Article V to make procedural or substantive changes to the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> itself? This question, which presents problems of the greatest theoretical difficulty, was posed starkly by Mr. Corwin 2 ̆ 7 s 1861 proposal. This article uses that Civil War-era proposal as a lens through which to study the tension between the claim that Article V articulates the exclusive procedure by which the Constitution may be amended and our nation 2 ̆ 7 s historical commitment to the ideal that the people are sovereign. Revisiting the long-forgotten Corwin Amendment illuminates current debates about the legal and political theory by which the U. S. Constitution can set forth the sole means for its revision. By understanding why the Corwin Amendment would have failed in its stated purpose (because a subsequent Article V amendment would have been sufficient to repeal it and grant Congress power over slavery), we discover certain fundamental constitutional principles. Those principles, important in their own right, also raise novel questions concerning the contemporary claims of Professors Ackerman and Amar that Article V cannot be the exclusive procedure for legitimate constitutional change...|$|R
2500|$|Six {{years later}} in 1973, the largest ever Constitution Bench of 13 Judges, heard {{arguments}} in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (case citation: AIR 1973 SC 1461). The Supreme Court reviewed the decision in Golaknath v. State of Punjab, and considered {{the validity of the}} 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th Amendments. The Court held, by a margin of 7-6, that although no part of the constitution, including fundamental rights, was beyond the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> of Parliament (thus overruling the 1967 case), the [...] "basic structure of the Constitution could not be abrogated even by a constitutional amendment". The decision of the Judges is complex, consisting of multiple opinions taking up one complete volume in the law reporter [...] "Supreme Court Cases". The findings included the following: ...|$|R
25|$|Held {{that the}} {{preamble}} to the Constitution contains the {{clue to the}} fundamentals of the Constitution. According to the learned Judges, Parts III and IV of the Constitution which respectively embody the fundamental rights and the directive principles have to be balanced and harmonised. This balance & harmony between two integral parts of the Constitution forms a basic element of the Constitution which cannot be altered. The word 'amendment' occurring in Article 368 must therefore be construed {{in such a manner}} as to preserve the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, but not so as to result in damaging or destroying the structure and identity of the Constitution. There was thus an implied limitation on the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> which prevented the Parliament from abolishing or changing the identity of the Constitution or any of its Basic Structure.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} focuses {{in defining}} the constitutional framing for fulfilling a possible {{will of the people}} of Catalonia in order to constitute a new and independent state. The paper starts from the relevance of current constitutional framework, the Spanish Constitution, and acknowledges the impossibility of channelling secession through this framework. The reason of this is because secession implies the emergency of a primary political subject, ignored by the current constitutional structure and addressing to exercise framing (constituent) <b>power.</b> Therefore <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> is not of relevance here. Nevertheless, it should be made a distinction between the expression of this framing will, which can be accommodated to current constitutional framework, and its fulfilment, which is clearly beyond. However, the framing process of emergent community should be respectful with the pre-existent community, within a supraconstitutional framework built by both actors implied, and based on democratic principle and rule of law, conceived in a substantial sense...|$|R

According to this Judgment-(i) the <b>power</b> to <b>amend</b> the Constitution {{is not to}} be found in Art. 368 but in Arts. 245, 246 and 248 read with Entry 97 of List 1; (ii) the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> {{can not be used to}} abridge or take away the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution; (iii) a law amending the Constitution is [...] "Law" [...] within the meaning of Art. 13(2) and (iv). the First, Fourth and Seventeenth Amendments though they abridged fundamental rights were valid in the past on the basis of earlier decisions of this Court and continue to be valid for the future. On the application of the doctrine of [...] "prospective overruling", as enunciated in the judgment, the decision will have only prospective operation and Parliament will have no power to abridge or take away Fundamental Rights from the date of the judgment.|$|R

As regards the First, Fourth and Seventh Amendments, these having long endured and been acquiesced in, he does not treat the question of their validity as being before him. As regards the Seventeenth Amendment he finds sufficient support {{for it in the}} Constitution as amended by the First, Fourth and Seventh Amendments and holds that the new definition of [...] "estate", introduced by the Amendment, though it is [...] "law" [...] under Art. 13 (2) and is an inroad into fundamental rights, is {{beyond the reach of the}} courts because it falls within the word [...] "law" [...] in Arts. 31 (1), (2), 2A and 31A(1).

Noorani notes [...] {{that the}} {{doctrine}} has [...] "now spread {{far and wide}} beyond its frontiers.", but that the eventual attribution to Dietrich Conrad is absent, who propounded the arguments in a lecture to the law faculty in the Banaras Hindu University. The argument, Noorani narrates made way to M K Nambyar who read the excerpt out in Golaknath. [...] "Perhaps {{the position of the}} Supreme Court is influenced {{by the fact that it}} has not so far been confronted with any extreme type of constitutional amendments. It is the duty of the jurist, though, to anticipate extreme cases of conflict, and sometimes only extreme tests reveal the true nature of a legal concept. So, if for the purpose of legal discussion, I may propose some fictive amendment laws to you, could it still be considered a valid exercise of the amendment power conferred by Article 368 if a two-thirds majority changed Article 1 by dividing India into two States of Tamilnad and Hindustan proper?"Could a constitutional amendment abolish Article 21, to the effect that forthwith a person could be deprived of his life or personal liberty without authorisation by law? Could the ruling party, if it sees its majority shrinking, amend Article 368 to the effect that the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> rests with the President acting on the advice of the Prime Minister? Could the <b>amending</b> <b>power</b> be used to abolish the Constitution and reintroduce, let us say, the rule of a moghul emperor or of the Crown of England? I do not want, by posing such questions, to provoke easy answers. But I should like to acquaint you with the discussion which took place on such questions among constitutional lawyers in Germany in the Weimar period - discussion, seeming academic at first, but suddenly illustrated by history in a drastic and terrible manner."
