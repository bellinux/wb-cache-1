40|$|AbstractGiven <b>a</b> simplicial {{hyperplane}} <b>arrangement</b> H and <b>a</b> subspace <b>arrangement</b> <b>A</b> {{embedded in}} H, we define a simplicial complex ΔA,H as the subdivision {{of the link}} of A induced by H. In particular, this generalizes Steingrímsson’s coloring complex of a graph. We do the following: (1) When A is <b>a</b> hyperplane <b>arrangement,</b> ΔA,H is shown to be shellable. As a special case, we answer affirmatively a question of Steingrímsson on coloring complexes. (2) For H <b>a</b> Coxeter <b>arrangement</b> of type <b>A</b> or B we obtain a close connection between the Hilbert series of the Stanley–Reisner ring of ΔA,H and the characteristic polynomial of A. This extends results of Steingrímsson and provides an interpretation of chromatic polynomials of hypergraphs and signed graphs in terms of Hilbert polynomials...|$|R
