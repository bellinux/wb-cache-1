5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck has a {{very large}} range extending across four continents. It breeds in lowland South America from northern Argentina to Colombia and then up to the southern US and the West Indies. It is found in a broad belt across sub-Saharan Africa <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> of the continent to South Africa and Madagascar. The Indian subcontinent is the Asian stronghold.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, {{the first}} {{sections}} of the Gotthard railway opened, linking Bellinzona to Biasca and Locarno. By 1882, the whole line was open, extending northwards to northern Switzerland via the Gotthard Tunnel, southwards to Lugano and Milan via the Monte Ceneri Pass, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> shore of Lake Maggiore to Luino. Between 1907 and 1972, Bellinzona was also linked to Mesocco and other Val Mesolcina communities by the Bellinzona–Mesocco railway.|$|E
25|$|Multinucleated sphere X (MSX) {{is caused}} by the {{protozoan}} Haplosporidium nelsoni, generally seen as a multinucleated Plasmodium. It is infectious and causes heavy mortality in the eastern oyster; survivors, however, develop resistance and can help propagate resistant populations. MSX is associated with high salinity and water temperatures. MSX was first noted in Delaware Bay in 1957, and is now found all up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Coast of the United States. Evidence suggests it was brought to the US when Crassostrea gigas, a Japanese oyster variety, was introduced to Delaware Bay.|$|E
25|$|Sheep farming {{began in}} the Wairarapa but soon spread up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> coast from Southland to the East Cape once {{rudimentary}} roads and transport became available. Much of the land used for farming was taken or leased from Māori. Sheep numbers grew quickly and by the mid-1850s, there were already a million sheep in New Zealand; by the early 1870s, there were 10 million. Wool became the first staple export, initially exported from the Wellington settlement in the late 1850s, although unrefrigerated meat and dairy products were exported as far as Australia.|$|E

25|$|PC-552 {{protected}} numerous convoys up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> {{coast and}} the Caribbean, {{as well as}} Convoy UGS-29, as part of Task Force 69. It also screened for the Battle of Normandy fleet. During this period, it make contact with suspected enemy submarines many times, vigorously attacking them each time. It was credited with just one kill, {{but that is not}} certain. Although PC-552 suffered air attack numerous times, it had only one surface to surface engagement with a German E-Boat 6–7 February 1945. In this case, PC-552 outgunned the target and the engagement consisted of a race. Ultimately, the E-Boat got away.|$|E
25|$|During September 1779, {{the four}} {{remaining}} vessels from a seven-strong squadron, which had {{departed from the}} anchorage at Groix off L’Orient in France on 14 August 1779, nominally {{under the command of}} American Continental Navy captain John Paul Jones, voyaged from a brief stop off Ireland, round the north of Scotland, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> coast of Britain, creating havoc wherever possible. Although sailing under the American flag, all the vessels were loaned or donated by France, with French captains, except for the Alliance, which had been built in Amesbury, Massachusetts specifically for the Continental Navy (although it had a French captain too). The crews included Americans, French volunteers, British sailors previously captured by the Americans and offered the chance to get out of captivity, and many others seeking glory or prize money.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred canal construction up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations {{in less than two}} years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round freight transportation, but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen {{were going to have to}} take a hard careful look. With steamboat tugs proven on the Merrimack and Middlesex Canal themselves, and news of railroads building in Europe and now, the United States, investors would need to adopt new techniques sooner or miss opportunities.|$|E

25|$|While {{living at}} the Verona apartments in Detroit's Cass Corridor, Chuck and Joni were regular {{performers}} at area coffee houses, including the Alcove bar, near Wayne State University; the Rathskeller, a restaurant {{on the campus of}} the University of Detroit; and the Raven Gallery in Southfield. She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician, Eric Andersen, in Detroit. Oscar Brand featured her several times on his CBC television program Let's Sing Out in 1965 and 1966, broadening her exposure. The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell dissolved in early 1967, and Joni moved to New York City to pursue her musical dreams as a solo artist. She played venues up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Coast, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style.|$|E
25|$|Morey {{demonstrated}} his {{engine in}} New York and Philadelphia {{and there are}} eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, {{when he decided to}} demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey’s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. Is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions , and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, it made sense to stop traveling up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> coast and call it quits.|$|E
500|$|An albino {{humpback}} whale that travels up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> coast of Australia became famous in local media {{because of its}} rare, all-white appearance. Migaloo is the only known all-white specimen and is a true albino. First sighted in 1991, the whale was named for an indigenous Australian word for [...] "white fella". To prevent sightseers approaching dangerously close, the Queensland government decreed a 500-m (1600-ft) exclusion zone around him.|$|E

500|$|The 1970s saw great {{upheaval}} in the Greek {{system and the}} university as a whole. Fraternities, whose membership was waning earlier, began to increase in size. In 1973 nearly 45 percent of first-years joined fraternities, the highest percentage in school history, and with this increased membership came more rowdy behavior. [...] In the 1970s the annual Easters parties, which had originated in the 1800s as formal dances sponsored by the ribbon societies, began to be particularly wild. The annual affair had evolved into a weekend-long celebration; the fraternities would flood Mad Bowl and the surrounding areas, creating huge mud pits for the event. By 1976, {{it was estimated that}} 15,000 people had come from up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Coast to pack Mad Bowl. Students washing mud off of themselves led to clogged drainage systems in the university, and entire dorms were flooded. Eventually the tradition became so belligerent and unmanageable that, in 1982, the university terminated Easters.|$|E
