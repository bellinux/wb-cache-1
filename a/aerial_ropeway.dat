25|$|The {{cableway}} and {{the cabins}} {{come from the}} Leitner Group. A continuous circulating bi-cable <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeway</b> system, where the track cable acts as a rail {{in the sky and}} the haul cable pulls the cabins, allows long spans between towers. It is the first of its type to be installed in Hong Kong. Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and bigger than that used in Austria. He said the steel columns used to support the system have to be stronger, and thus more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Hopes of {{extensions}} {{were raised}} when the Southern Railway invested £44,000 in discounted shares (£220,000 at par) in 1926, but dashed when it lost interest (although remaining friendly and having directors on the Board). The railway {{settled down to}} running coal trains for Tilmanstone Colliery as its only profitable activity. The colliery company objected to its rates, and opened an <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeway</b> in competition to the Eastern Arm of Dover Harbour in 1930. This was a failure, as the coal did not sell on the export market and mostly found a market in London. However, it was only dismantled in 1952.|$|E

30|$|As it {{is shown}} in the related literatures [2, 6, 9, 11, 12], <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> are an {{effective}} {{alternative to the}} conventional modes of land public transport in metropolitan areas and cities. <b>Aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> may be labeled as high-speed urban transport. The average speed of the passenger cabins may be from 18 to 40  km/h [9, 10, 13]. This value is higher than an average travel speed of the conventional land transport in straitened urban conditions. In addition, the problem of transport accessibility is becoming increasingly important when evaluating projects for the modernization of transport infrastructure in major urban centers [14]. This indicator is an apparent advantage of <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> as well.|$|R
25|$|Designed by Aedas, {{also the}} {{architect}} of the project, the line uses a continuous circulating twin cable <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeway</b> system, technically described as a bi-cable gondola lift. The Leitner Group was the contractor for the cable car system. Between the Tung Chung and Ngong Ping Terminals, the 5.7km cableway changes direction twice at the two angle stations, one on the south shore of Chek Lap Kok; the other west of Nei Lak Shan within the Lantau North Country Park. Whilst the gondola cabins are temporarily detached from the cables at each angle station, there are no passenger loading or unloading facilities at these points.|$|E
25|$|Work was {{commenced}} at Tilmanstone in 1906. An {{accident in}} 1909 killed {{three men and}} destroyed the pumping system, causing the mine to flood and work was abandoned for nine months. The site {{was connected to the}} East Kent Light Railway in 1912 and coal first brought to the surface in March 1913. An accident at the pit on 27 February 1931 resulted in Sydney William Padfield being awarded a bronze Edward Medal, the only one awarded in the Kent Coalfield. An <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeway</b> was built in 1930 to link the pit with Dover Harbour. This included tunnelling through the cliff at Dover to deliver the coal to a 5,000 ton bunker at the harbour. It wasn't used much after 1935, and was dismantled in 1954. In 1945, the workforce was 914, with 631 being employed sub-surface and 283 above. The colliery closed in 1986, having produced over 20,000,000 tons of coal. A system of tokens was used in the pithead baths and canteen and a lamp check was operated, in common with the majority of pits. All buildings have been demolished.|$|E

30|$|A {{detailed}} {{review of}} exploitation of <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> in different cities {{is given in}} [2, 13, 15]. In the urbanized environment, <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> have begun to {{play an active role}} in the last 10 ~ 15  years [16]. Therefore, due to the lack of theoretical studies and scientific publications on the topic, at present a lot of specific questions related to designing, calculation and modeling of operational processes in <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> should be considered specifically for the urbanized environment. Among the early publications on the issue is the research presented in [17]. Questions related to the productivity, cost and possibility of applying of cable-propelled systems in the urban environment are considered in the article. A number of papers addressed the issues of the effect of climatic factors (wind and air temperature difference) on the dynamics of passenger cabins and the cable system of <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> [18, 19]; calculation of strength and tension of carrying ropes [20, 21, 22]; safety of passenger transportation [2, 3].|$|R

30|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> {{are widely}} used as {{continuous}} transport for organization of passenger and cargo carriage in many countries worldwide [1, 2]. Passenger <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> are mostly used for rapid and convenient movement of people to the sports, tourist, ecological and health-improving facilities within nature areas with difficult terrain which are difficult to access [3, 4]. Cargo ropeways are used in many sectors of economics for transportation of different cargos. The industries where {{one can see the}} use of cargo ropeways are mining, coal, chemical, metallurgical, power, timber and agricultural [5, 6, 7, 8]. According to the data of the comparative techno-economic study [2, 9, 10, 11], <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> are more economically and environmentally beneficial than land transport (road, conveyor and rail), especially in cases when the terrain, high density of the housing and industrial development and various urban planning restrictions impede the development of the ground traffic.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{reliably}} monitor the operating status of one-way <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> for underground mine and better guarantee {{the safety of}} mine personnel, a hierarchical routing protocol based on energy efficiency and chain-type structure is proposed in this paper. Previous studies show that uniform cluster formation can prolong the lifetime of network. So a novel time allocation algorithm based on the residual energy of node is put forward {{to ensure that the}} starting time uniformly distributes in duration time of establishing network, when the nodes compete to become the cluster head node. Total energy consumption model based on free-space radio signal transmission model is used to search the optimal radius of node which can minimize total consumed energy of the network per round. The simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol is suitable for the operating status monitoring of one-way <b>aerial</b> <b>ropeways</b> for underground mine and the performance is better than LEACH...|$|R
