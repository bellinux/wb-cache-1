5|$|By 1591, {{the king}} of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was {{installed}} by the Portuguese. Although he was nominally a client, he resisted missionary activities and helped the interior Kandyan kingdom in its quest to get military help from South India. Eventually, a usurper named Cankili II, resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> fled the core areas of the former kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E

The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many failed to fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through {{the region as a}} tropical storm. Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters, as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. <b>As</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, hardware stores and food markets were generally well-stocked.|$|E

25|$|The hedonic {{treadmill}} theory originally {{proposed that}} most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent {{research has shown that}} for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E

25|$|In 2015 a {{study was}} {{published}} in Energy and Environmental Science that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass. Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable, as by 2050 it would save about $600 Billion Dollars health costs a year due to reduced air pollution and $3.3 Trillion global warming costs. This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway. According to that study, barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> didn't know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs.|$|E
25|$|This {{period was}} fueled by {{skateboard}} companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976, and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, {{made it possible for}} skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. <b>As</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} {{as a light}} rail between Majorstuen to Holmenkollen. The {{terminus}} at Majorstuen was an inconvenience for passengers <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> were bound for the city center and had to change to the street trams. For the operator Holmenkolbanen, there were two ways to solve the issue. They could sign trackage rights with Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei to use the Briskeby Line to reach the city center. Alternatively, a tunnel could be built to an underground station in the city center. Applications for a tunnel {{were sent to the}} municipality in 1901. However, disagreements as to whether the tunnel was to be considered a railway or tramway halted progress; the city considered the line a tramway while the company considered it to be a railway.|$|E
50|$|The 20th {{century is}} not the first to create images of life during medieval times. The Middle Ages ended over five centuries ago and each century has imagined, portrayed and {{depicted}} the Middle Ages through painting, architecture, poetry, music and novel. In the 20th century, film has defined Medieval history perhaps more so than any other medium. While the conclusions of academic research and findings of archeology have advanced knowledge of the Middle Ages, nothing has had more widespread influence on more people than the images created by film.

25|$|Methane is nontoxic, {{yet it is}} {{extremely}} flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant {{is much higher than}} the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E

25|$|The {{types of}} homes that {{were built in}} that time and area, usually one story rubble masonry with heavy flat roofs that were often already damaged, were not {{resistant}} to even {{a small amount of}} shaking. Public structures like bridges and walls fared better, as they were usually constructed with higher standards. The heavy damage in certain areas occurred for various reasons. Some cities were built on steep hillsides overlooking the plains (done for security reasons), while other sites were located on unstable soil where landslides had occurred previously. These conditions made assessing the intensity of the earthquake difficult, but Ambraseys settled on a maximum value of VII–VIII (Very strong–Damaging) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale for the event. That scale was used primarily in Europe and the Soviet Union up until the 1990s.

25|$|J.J., <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> at Columbia called him, soon joined Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The Columbia University {{chapter of}} SDS had been {{founded in the}} 1950s {{as part of the}} Student League for Industrial Democracy, the youth arm of the League for Industrial Democracy (a social {{democratic}} organization co-founded by Jack London, Norman Thomas, Upton Sinclair and others). The chapter had sputtered for years, but became active in 1965 when it became known as SDS). Jacobs became very active in the group. A series of protests against on-campus military, CIA and corporate recruitment and ROTC induction ceremonies rocked Columbia's campus for the next two years. Jacobs organized a protest in February 1967 against CIA recruiting at Columbia. Initially, the SDS chapter disavowed the action. But when Jacobs' sit-in proved popular among Columbia students, SDS claimed J.J. as one of their own. The CIA protest led to Jacobs' rapid rise within the chapter. The protests led Columbia President Grayson L. Kirk to ban indoor protests at Columbia beginning in September 1967.|$|E

500|$|Girdap's {{constituent}} assembly {{was held on}} 1 December 1881, less than {{four years after the}} Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria. At the time, the northeastern Bulgarian city of Ruse was a major economic hub. Ruse prospered due to its role as a major port on the Danube, its rapid industrial development and its well-established ties with Central Europe along that river. Banking, however, was a new concept, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> employed the services of money lenders and entrusted their savings to people they knew personally. The founders of Girdap sought to [...] "liberate the population of money lenders", in the words of later bank director Boncho Boev. Due to an overall lack of capital in the country, interest rates of loans given by Girdap were nonetheless high: 15–18% as compared to the over 20–30% interest rate of money lenders. The bank officially commenced operations on 1 January 1882. It took its name from the Girdap neighbourhood of Ruse where the {{constituent assembly}} was held.|$|E
