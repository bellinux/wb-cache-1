5|$|An unusual <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> {{the nearby}} {{thatched}} two-storey monks' reredorter or lavatory, {{which is considered}} unique in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The ride's layout was {{specifically}} designed to fit in the Yankee Harbor themed area at Six Flags Great America, although the layout for each successive <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> identical or {{a mirror image of}} the original.|$|E
5|$|After a {{year and}} a half of {{preparation}} and development, Behemoth premiered in May 2008. With its high speeds, tall heights and rapid changes in both direction and elevation, the <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> one of the most aggressive thrill rides in the park. Behemoth also has a high hourly passenger throughput – making it one of the most efficient rides in the park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Attractions</b> <b>are</b> {{covered by}} {{industry}} trade magazines including Hauntworld Magazine, Haunted Attraction Magazine, and Fangoria. The industry {{has also been}} featured by television networks, and <b>attractions</b> <b>are</b> ranked {{by a variety of}} special-interest web sites.|$|R
5000|$|The {{successor}} of this <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> the Jules Verne themed 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. The <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> given a Nautilus {{theme and}} a narration by Peter Renaday, whose voice {{was similar to}} that of actor James Mason, who portrayed Captain Nemo in the 1954 Disney film. The <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1994 for a [...] "rehabilitation" [...] period, but never reopened. Management felt that continual maintenance of the <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> simply too costly. In 2004, ten years after its closure, the water was drained and the lagoon area was paved over to create new land for Fantasyland.|$|R
50|$|Most tourist <b>attractions</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} by private companies, including companies owned, or {{funded by the}} States of Jersey. Elizabeth Castle, for example, is controlled by Jersey Heritage. Some other <b>attractions</b> <b>are</b> owned by the National Trust for Jersey.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> the Gomantong Caves, {{which is}} home to {{hundreds}} of thousands of swifts who build their nests high on cave walls and roofs.

5|$|Diagon Alley's {{flagship}} <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, 3-D motion-based steel {{roller coaster}} dark ride based around Gringotts Bank, the wizarding bank in Diagon Alley. Riders enter the bank into the queue area where Bogrod greets visitors and instructs {{them to continue}} past him to travel deep into the vaults of the bank to open an account.

5000|$|The <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} to Derry Township on August 17, 2010. The <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> described as reaching a maximum height of 212.6 ft [...] [...] In a subsequent meeting, the park shared a potential blueprint of a roller coaster.|$|R
50|$|Haunted <b>attractions</b> <b>are</b> {{entertainment}} venues {{designed to}} thrill and scare patrons. Most <b>attractions</b> <b>are</b> seasonal Halloween businesses that may include haunted houses, corn mazes, and hayrides, {{and the level}} of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown.|$|R
50|$|As of 2009, the <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} but not operating, {{and as of}} 2010 the <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> discontinued, and is {{no longer}} a functioning attraction. Although the facade is still present in its entirety, the upper floors have been gutted.|$|R
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man is a motion-based 3D dark ride {{located at}} the Islands of Adventure, Orlando and Universal Studios Japan, Osaka theme parks. Built for Islands of Adventure's opening in 1999, the <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> a hybrid ride {{combining}} special roving motion vehicles with 3D projection, elaborate physical sets, and both practical and tactile effects.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the films and books, Universal and Warner Brothers {{announced}} they would create The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a new Harry Potter-themed expansion to the Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida.

The flagship <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which exists within a re-creation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

50|$|In 2016, the <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} to be temporarily closing {{as part of}} Alton Towers' Towers Loving Care initiative. However, when Alton Towers' website was updated on 16 January 2017, the <b>attraction</b> <b>was</b> not listed at all, implying permanent closure.|$|R

5|$|Four years later, on 8 July 2014, Universal {{opened a}} Harry Potter-themed {{area at the}} Universal Studios Florida theme park. It {{includes}} a re-creation of Diagon Alley and connecting alleys and a small section of Muggle London. The flagship <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride. Universal also added a completely functioning recreation of the Hogwarts Express connecting Kings Cross Station at Universal Studios Florida to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure. Both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley contain many shops and restaurants from the book series, including Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and The Leaky Cauldron.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} was officially {{announced}} for Islands of Adventure on May 31, 2007, {{and after a}} two-and-a-half-year construction period, the area officially {{opened to the public}} on June 18, 2010. The area's flagship <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which exists within a re-creation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It takes riders on a journey through Harry Potter's wizarding world. Other attractions include Dragon Challenge, a now-closed pair of inverted roller coasters, and Flight of the Hippogriff, a family roller coaster. The area also features a re-creation of Hogsmeade containing many gift shops and restaurants from the novels including Dervish and Banges, Honeydukes, Ollivanders, Zonko's Joke Shop (though it houses Honeydukes), the Three Broomsticks, and the Hog's Head.|$|E

In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. Sideshow Bob, however, is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors.

Pocahontas, having been moved by Smith’s nobility, says she will not allow Smith to be killed unless she herself dies with him. This persuades Powhatan to free Smith. Soon, Percy and Rolfe encounter Smith and his Indian allies {{on the way back to}} the settlement, and Rolfe is immediately struck by Pocahontas, whose manner suggests the <b>attraction</b> <b>is</b> mutual. They speak of love, but Rolfe must soon depart with Smith. Pocahontas confesses her love for Rolfe to Miami, who receives the news with anger, jealousy and rage. Pocahontas convinces her father to dissolve her arranged engagement with Miami, which will mean war between their two tribes.|$|E
