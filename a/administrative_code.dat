5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's <b>Administrative</b> <b>Code.</b> The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Observational {{research}} frequently uses <b>administrative</b> <b>codes</b> {{for mental}} health or substance use diagnoses and for important behaviours such as suicide attempts. We sought to validate codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th edition, clinical modification diagnostic and E-codes) entered in Veterans Health Administration administrative data for patients with depression versus a gold standard of electronic medical record text ("chart notation"). Methods Three random samples of patients were selected, each stratified by geographic region, gender, and year of cohort entry, from a VHA depression treatment cohort from April 1, 1999 to September 30, 2004. The first sample was selected from patients who died by suicide, the second from patients who remained alive on the date of death of suicide cases, and the third from patients with a new start of a commonly used antidepressant medication. Four variables were assessed using <b>administrative</b> <b>codes</b> in the year prior to the index date: suicide attempt, alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence and tobacco use. Results Specificity was high (≥ 90 %) for all four <b>administrative</b> <b>codes,</b> regardless of the sample. Sensitivity was ≤ 75 % and was particularly low for suicide attempt (≤ 17 %). Positive predictive values for alcohol dependence/abuse and tobacco use were high, but barely better than flipping a coin for illicit drug abuse/dependence. Sensitivity differed across the three samples, but was highest in the suicide death sample. Conclusions Administrative data-based diagnoses among VHA records have high specificity, but low sensitivity. The accuracy level varies by different diagnosis and by different patient subgroup. </p...|$|R

After New Jersey's current state constitution was adopted in 1947 and some departments were consolidated, the department was incorporated into the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The statutes define an alcoholic beverage as [...] "any fluid or solid capable of being converted into a fluid, suitable for human consumption, and having an alcohol content of more than one-half of one per centum (1/2 of 1%) by volume, including alcohol, beer, lager beer, ale, porter, naturally fermented wine, treated wine, blended wine, fortified wine, sparkling wine, distilled liquors, blended distilled liquors and any brewed, fermented or distilled liquors fit for use for beverage purposes or any mixture of the same, and fruit juices." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 20, 2012, in {{what the}} Associated Press {{described}} as their [...] "breakthrough performance", eight {{members of the group}} performed a song on the Lobnoye Mesto in Red Square, entitled [...] "Putin Zassal". The title was variously translated by English language media as [...] "Putin has Pissed Himself", [...] "Putin Chickened Out", [...] "Putin Got Scared" [...] and [...] "Putin is Wetting Himself". The song called for a popular revolt against the Russian government and an occupation of Red Square. According to a Pussy Riot member identified as [...] "Shayba", the song was inspired by the events of December 24, 2011, during which approximately 100,000 people attended anti-Putin rallies in central Moscow. She told the Financial Times: [...] "We saw how troops were moving around Moscow, there were helicopters in the sky, the military was put on alert. The regime just wet its pants on that day. And the symbol of the regime is Putin." [...] During the performance a member ignited a smoke bomb, which led to Pussy Riot members being arrested and briefly detained on administrative charges, a Russian legal term similar to a summary offence or misdemeanor. A judge found two members of the group, Galkina and Schebleva, [...] "guilty under article 20.2 of the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Code</b> (violation of the rules for conducting rallies and pickets) and imposed a fine of 500 rubles on each." ...|$|E
