30|$|Results {{suggest that}} about 23 % of the {{population}} belonging to multidimensional poor households <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment had experienced short-term morbidities <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reference period of 30  days compared to 20 % {{of the population}} belonging to multidimensional non-poor households <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, 19 % of the population belonging to multidimensional poor households <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment and 15 % of the population belonging to multidimensional non-poor households <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment. Controlling for socioeconomic covariates, the odds of short-term morbidity was 1.47 [CI 1.40 – 1.53] among the multidimensional poor <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, 1.28 [CI 1.21 – 1.37] among the multidimensional non-poor <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment and 1.21 [CI 1.64 – 1.28] among the multidimensional poor <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment compared to the multidimensional non-poor <b>and</b> living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment. Results are robust across states and hold good {{for each of the}} three morbidities: fever, cough and diarrhoea. This establishes that along with poverty, household environmental conditions have a significant bearing on short-term morbidities in India. Public investment in sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel can reduce the morbidity and improve the health of the population.|$|R
