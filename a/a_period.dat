5|$|At {{least three}} red giants are Mira {{variables}} in Canis Minor. S Canis Minoris, of spectral type M7e, is the brightest, ranging from magnitude 6.6 to 13.2 over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of 332.94 days. V Canis Minoris ranges from magnitude 7.4 to 15.1 over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of 366.1 days.

5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across <b>a</b> <b>period,</b> atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across <b>a</b> <b>period.</b> The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across <b>a</b> <b>period.</b> Metals (left side of <b>a</b> <b>period)</b> generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of <b>a</b> <b>period),</b> with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E

After <b>a</b> <b>period</b> in which the 18th Brigade was held back in reserve at Port Moresby to defend the approaches to Lae, in December 1943 the 2/10th was sent into the Finisterre Mountains, where they joined the rest of the 7th Division whose campaign through the Markham and Ramu Valleys had culminated in heavy fighting around Shaggy Ridge during the first months of 1944.
