40|$|About the book: Critical Perspectives on Private <b>Authority</b> <b>in</b> Global Politics brings {{together}} an interdisciplinary group of distinguished scholars {{to explore the}} systems of knowledge, institutions, social meanings and social practices that constitute <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> contemporary politics. Drawing on original empirical research and studies of governmentality and institutions, this book challenges prevailing ideas about the emergence of private <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> global politics. The contributors examine the porosity and contextual nature of distinctions that are often taken for granted, including the public and private, the national and international, the local and global. Organized around three key themes - the disaggregation of authority, the innovation of authority and the mediation of authority - this book is a fascinating addition to the growing literature on private <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> global politics...|$|R
