25|$|Compared {{to earlier}} research, the {{assimilation}} and transformation of pre-existing architectural traditions is investigated under {{the aspect of}} mutual intra- and intercultural exchange of ideas, technologies and styles as well as artists, architects, and materials.

Early research into the area regarded the early Islamic architecture merely as a break with the past, from which apparently rose a distorted and less expressive form of art, or a degenerate imitation of the post-classical architectural forms. Modern concepts tend to regard the transition between the cultures rather as a selective process of informed appropriation and transformation.

We provide efficient distributed algorithms to optimally solve the best-coverage problem raised in [1]. In addition, we consider <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>sensing</b> model: The sensing ability diminishes as the distance increases.

We prove that for every measure μ (i. e., convolution Φ) and every λe there is no fixed point attractor.

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between proper names and common names is that proper names denote a unique entity e.g. London Bridge, while common names {{are used in}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> in reference to a class of objects e.g. bridge. Many proper names are obscure in meaning as they lack any apparent meaning {{in the way that}} ordinary words mean, probably for the practical reason that when they consist of Collective nouns, they refer to groups, even when they are inflected for the singular e.g. [...] "committee".

30|$|Later on, many generalizations, {{extensions}} {{and applications}} of this theorem {{have appeared in}} the literature (see, for instance, [6 – 13]). In this literature review, we start from looking at the paper of Wardowski [14] who introduced a new concept of contraction, called F-contraction. Consequently, Wardowski proved fixed point theorems generalizing the Banach-Caccioppoli fixed point theorem (of which Theorem  1.1 is the multivalued version) in a new way than in the previous known theorems of the same class. Subsequently, Sgroi and Vetro [15] extended Wardowski’s ideas to the case of multivalued mappings and studied the solution of certain functional and integral equations under a suitable set of hypotheses. Yet another inspiration for our work comes from Feng and Liu’s paper [16] providing useful tools to establish both global and local fixed point theorems. Finally, we recall that the concept of metric space has been generalized in many directions to include measurements in <b>a</b> much <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>sense.</b> Here, we focus our attention on the notion of b-metric spaces, which are metric spaces satisfying a relaxed form of triangle inequality, see Czerwik [17] and Bakhtin [18].

40|$|The {{personal}} {{relevance of}} an object is multi-faceted, each facet being capable of contributing to the effects on object memory attributed to personal relevance.

Images and drawings were produced under generic (e. g., “Please draw a bed”) and personal exemplar (e. g., “Please draw your bed”) instructions, and participants indicated the degree to which the image on which their drawing was based was of a specific object or a generic object. Object specificity induced a sense of time and place for a remembered object, the most recent encounter with the object being most salient. Other aspects of personal relevance collectively facilitated the retrieval {{of an object}}’s category-irrelevant features (thereby increasing the vividness of the object image), the other objects with which it was seen, and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> episodic <b>sense</b> of place.

40|$|Alternative {{theories}} of relativistic rotation considered viable as of 2004 are compared {{in the light}} of experiments reported in 2005. En route, the contentious issue of simultaneity choice in rotation is resolved by showing that only one simultaneity choice, the one possessing continuous time, gives rise, via the general relativistic equation of motion, to the correct Newtonian limit Coriolis acceleration. In addition, the widely dispersed argument purporting Lorentz contraction in rotation and the concomitant curved surface of a rotating disk is analyzed and argued to be lacking for more than one reason. It is posited that not by theoretical arguments, but only via experiment can we know whether such effect exists in rotation or not. The Coriolis/simultaneity correlation, and the results of the 2005 experiments, support the Selleri theory as being closest to the truth, though it is incomplete in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> applicability <b>sense,</b> because it does not provide a global metric.

2500|$|Schleiermacher’s {{desire to}} {{approach}} hermeneutics in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> {{was an attempt}} to shift away from more specific methods of interpretation, such as ways of interpreting biblical or classical texts, to a focus on the way in which people understand texts in general. Though he was certainly interested in interpreting Scripture, he thought one could only do so properly once one had established a system of interpretation that was applicable to all texts. This process was not a systematic or strictly philological approach, but what he called [...] "the art of understanding." [...] Schleiermacher understood that reading a text was a discourse between the interpreter and the text itself; however, he considered the text as the means by which the author is communicating thoughts previous {{to the creation of the}} text.

2500|$|Looking at the {{language}} of the play in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> has also produced a range of critical theories. For example, Jacques Berthoud argues that the rhetoric of the play is explicitly bound up with its theme; [...] "the entire dramatic script, soliloquies included, functions as a network of responses and reactions. [...] primary and consistent function is interlocutory." [...] An entirely different interpretation is that of Jack Reese, who argues that Shakespeare's use of language functions to remove the audience from the effects and implications of violence; it has an almost Brechtian verfremdungseffekt. Using the example of Marcus' speech, Reese argues that the audience is disconnected from the violence through the seemingly incongruent descriptions of that violence. Such language serves to [...] "further emphasise the artificiality of the play; in a sense, they suggest to the audience that it is hearing a poem read rather than seeing the events of that poem put into dramatic form." [...] Gillian Kendall, however, reaches the opposite conclusion, arguing that rhetorical devices such as metaphor augment the violent imagery, not diminish it, because the figurative use of certain words complements their literal counterparts. This, however, [...] "disrupts the way the audience perceives imagery." [...] An example of this is seen in the body politic/dead body imagery early in the play, as the two images soon become interchangeable. Another theory is provided by Peter M. Sacks, who argues that {{the language}} of the play is marked by [...] "an artificial and heavily emblematic style, and above all a revoltingly grotesque series of horrors which seem to have little function but to ironise man's inadequate expressions of pain and loss".|$|E
