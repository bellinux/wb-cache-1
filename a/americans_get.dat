500|$|Box-office {{analysts and}} critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, {{reasoned}} the film underperformed {{at the box}} office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that <b>Americans</b> <b>get</b> horror and comedy, but with the idea [...] "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb". [...] "The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films Tremors, Slither, Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks and The Evil Dead series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, [...] "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can." [...] In addition, he labeled the Scream franchise as more [...] "straight-up horror" [...] than comedy and stated Zombielands box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.|$|E

He would certainly accept it. He writes his cheque and turns back at the earliest opportunity to his miniature gardens and the odd little freaks of collecting that attract him. Have you ever heard of chintz oil jars? 'No,' you will say. Nor has anyone else yet except our immediate circle of friends and a few dealers who are no doubt industriously increasing the present scanty supply. We possess three. They are matronly shaped jars about two feet or a yard high, of a kind of terra-cotta with wooden tops surmounted by gilt acorns, and they have been covered with white paint and on this flowers and birds and figures from some very rich old chintz have been stuck very cunningly, and then everything has been varnished--and there you are. Our first and best was bought for seven-and-sixpence, brought home in the car, put upon a console table on the second landing and worshipped. It's really a very pleasant mellow thing to see. Nobody had ever seen the like. Guests, sycophantic people of all sorts were taken to consider it. It was looked at with heads at every angle, one man even kept his head erect and one went a little upstairs and looked at it under his arm. Also the most powerful lenses have been used for a minute examination, and one expert licked the varnish and looked extremely thoughtful and wise at me as he turned the booty over his gifted tongue. And now, God being with us, we mean to possess every specimen in existence--before the <b>Americans</b> <b>get</b> hold of the idea.
