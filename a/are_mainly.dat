5|$|Excess calcium in {{the urine}} (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> composed of calcium phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile heavy metals <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> f-block elements {{and the more}} reactive of the d-block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile heavy metals <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> the less reactive d-block elements, and period 4–6 p-block metals and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E

30|$|LCG {{tight oil}} <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> {{distributed}} in {{the upper and lower}} sweet spot, where in upper sweet spot source rocks TOC <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> {{distributed in the}} range of 2 – 8 %, lower sweet spot source rocks TOC <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> distributed in the range of 0.5 – 6 %, and non-sweet spot hydrocarbon source rocks TOC <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> distributed in the 0.5 – 4 %. Hydrocarbon source rocks abundance is significantly lower than the sweet spot, indicating that Lucaogou Formation tight oil <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> distributed in the high organic abundance of source rocks symbiotic tight reservoirs, and high quality mature hydrocarbon source rocks inside or adjacent to tight reservoir <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> tight oil distributed layer system.|$|R

30|$|MLS were {{prescribed}} for 1045 unique diagnostic codes and AMC was {{prescribed for}} 989 different diagnostic codes. Prescription rates showed {{that all the}} antibiotics {{included in this study}} <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> prescribed for respiratory infections with slight variations over the study period that did not change the overall pattern. When looking at more detailed diagnostic categories related to infections over all the study period, macrolides <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> used for bronchitis, pharyngitis, and gastrointestinal infections. Lincosamides <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> prescribed for tonsillitis, gastrointestinal infections, and skin infections.

40|$|Wireless systems <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> {{based on}} the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to split the input signals into number of sub carrier signals. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing requires an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). The inverse fast Fourier transform <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to produce multiple sub-carriers signal. The FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications is described in this paper. The architecture uses single path delay feedback style and it occupies less memory space. The read only memory <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to store the twiddle factors. To eliminate the Read Only Memory (ROM) a ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor is used. The reconfigurable complex multipliers <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to achieve the ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor and the bit parallel multipliers <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used for square root evaluation. The Fused Multiply Add (FMA) operation {{is very important in}} many scientific and engineering fields. The floating point unit increases the performance and accuracy of the floating point. The Fused Multiply and Add unit <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to reduce the latency and power...|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{pelicans}} and double-crested cormorants <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> {{found on}} cliffs {{along the coast}} and on seastacks, while sandpipers and gulls inhabit the seacoast and inland areas.

At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands.|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
