In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made <b>an</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>that</b> the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer.
