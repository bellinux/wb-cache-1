50|$|Ways {{to prevent}} razor burn include keeping the skin moist, using a shaving brush and lather, using a {{moisturizing}} shaving gel, shaving {{in the direction}} of the hair growth, resisting the urge to shave too closely, applying minimal pressure, avoiding scratching or irritation <b>after</b> <b>shaving,</b> avoiding irritating <b>products</b> on the <b>shaved</b> area (colognes, perfumes, etc.) and using an aftershave cream with aloe vera or other emollients.

3000|$|The {{ingredient}} {{lists of}} 100 natural {{personal care products}} that were available on the European retail or online market were analyzed. These products were a random selection of ten products each marketed by ten established European manufacturers (German, Swiss, Danish and French) covering a wide price segment. The most expensive products were nearly 20 times as expensive as the comparable cheapest products. The {{purpose of this study}} was to make a spot check of natural products. The spectrum was as wide as possible (e.g. <b>after</b> <b>shave,</b> anti-pimples <b>product,</b> body lotion, cleanser, day cream, deodorant, face mask, hair color, hair conditioner, lip balm, mascara, massage oil, mouth wash, nail balm, shampoo, shower gel). The small number of products analyzed cannot be representative nor comprehensive for natural cosmetics in general. The purpose was here to compile and analyze publically available data only and prepare the floor for further studies. Natural substances were defined here as substances, which originate clearly from a specific organism (indicated by its scientific Latin binomials or known to be from a definite biological species) as described in [13]. Substances from organisms which were a chemical group of substances that had been isolated from an organism or had undergone a chemical reaction were not considered here, e.g. ‘Brassica campestris sterols’, ‘tapioca starch’, ‘hydrolyzed wheat gluten’, ‘hydrogenated castor oil’, or ‘hydrogenated coconut acid’. There were some borderline cases: Xanthan gum and shellac were considered here, as these substances can occur as such in nature.
