5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary <b>and</b> <b>Artistic</b> Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of literary <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, {{in any manner or}} form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E
5|$|Zygmunt I Stary, {{who built}} the {{presently}} existing Wawel Renaissance castle, and his son Sigismund II Augustus, supported intellectual <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> activities and surrounded themselves with the creative elite.

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> quality.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International organises {{campaigns to}} protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a {{prisoner}} of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> freedom of expression and association.

In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|Beatty had {{a concept}} for a Dick Tracy film in 1975. At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, {{who gave up}} his option from Tribune Media Services after he was {{unsuccessful}} in pitching Dick Tracy to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing/distributing Dick Tracy. Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). The deal fell through when Chester Gould insisted on strict financial <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> control.|$|E
5|$|Creekside, a {{regeneration}} area beside Deptford Creek, {{is used for}} educational <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> purposes, such as the Laban Dance Centre, which was designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, and opened in February 2003; and the Art in Perpetuity Trust (APT) gallery and studio space.

5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E
5|$|Development lasted {{five months}} {{on a small}} budget {{with a team of}} only three core members and two support staff. The team leads had {{previously}} worked together on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for the Super NES, and so chose to develop for that system. Wild Guns was heavily influenced in its gameplay <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> design by arcade games such as Blood Bros. and Dynamite Duke. The game's scenery, characters, and sound design drew ideas from the Western film genre and the science fiction manga Cobra, creating a space western setting.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{architectural}} <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> value, the Church of St George {{has been}} part of the list of Bulgaria's monuments of cultural of national importance since 1927.

Together with the native house of Dimitar Peshev and the city art gallery, since 2010 it has been listed as number 26 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.|$|E
