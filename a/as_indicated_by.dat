Such compounds are useful in materials science as well as organic synthesis. A well known derivative is titanium isopropoxide, which is a monomer.|$|E

The earliest stages of Mongolian (Xianbei, Wuhuan languages) may have used an indigenous runic script <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> Chinese sources. The Khitan large script adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) script.|$|E

5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. <b>As</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. <b>As</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cenade {{village in}} Transylvania's Alba County (at {{the time in}} Alsó-Fehér County), Agârbiceanu was the second of eight children; his parents were Nicolae and Ana (née Olariu). His father and {{grandfather}} were both woodcutters, while he believed his great-grandparents were cowherds, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> the surname of his grandfather, Vasile , who originated in the Sibiu area. The name Agârbiceanu came from the family's ancestral village, Agârbiciu. According to the novelist's own notes, his father was literate and subscribed {{to a number of}} Romanian-language publications that appeared in Transylvania. His mother, although a great lover of stories and storytelling, was illiterate.|$|E

5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Freeborn Roman {{women were}} {{considered}} citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, {{but did not}} vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos ("children born of two Roman citizens"). A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. <b>As</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards.

5|$|In Belgium, {{the growth}} of the {{religion}} quickly begin to slow down, even to decline, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that no temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused {{because of a lack of}} dressed members and/or money. In contrast, the constructions of the temples in France has been continued until 1993, when a new temple in Toulouse was opened.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then {{make decisions based on}} what they know, or do not know, <b>as</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
