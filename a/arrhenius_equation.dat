2500|$|Van 't Hoff studied {{chemical}} {{dynamics and}} published in 1884 his famous [...] "Etudes de dynamique chimique". In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by {{the discovery of the}} laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions". After van 't Hoff, chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first order reactions, and second order reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>equation</b> and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.|$|E

Two intermediate phases, Pt 3 Al and α-NiPt(Al), are found to develop between the Pt and β-NiAl couples. The thicknesses of Pt 3 Al and α-NiPt(Al) layers varies linearly with the square of annealing time, indicating that the growth of Pt 3 Al and α-NiPt(Al) are diffusion-controlled. The calculated <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>equations</b> of the parabolic growth constants, k, for the Pt 3 Al and β-NiPt(Al) phases are obtained, respectively.

The oligomer {{can be used}} to prepare high performance resin-based composite material via resin transfer molding (RTM) due to its low melt viscosity (< 2 Pa. s) between 250 O C and 320 O C.

In this research, the rheological properties of the oligomer were measured and numerically fit with the dual Arrhenius model to predict the progression of the viscosity during cure.

The mathematics of the model are based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Respiration is simplified as the effect of one enzymic reaction, inhibited by its own product, carbon dioxide. Both competitive, and uncompetitive inhibition are incorporated. Fermentation is modelled including the competitive inhibition of fermentation by both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Temperature dependence is introduced using <b>Arrhenius</b> <b>equations</b> for the maximum rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.
