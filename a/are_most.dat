5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections <b>are</b> <b>most</b> common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections <b>are</b> <b>most</b> common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|An uncompetitive {{inhibitor}} cannot bind to {{the free}} enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors <b>are</b> <b>most</b> effective at high substrate concentration. In {{the presence of the}} inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive. This type of inhibition is rare.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Dyson sphere {{originated}} in fiction, {{and it is}} a concept that has appeared often in science fiction since then.

5|$|Despite {{formerly}} being working class, Summer Hill {{and many}} of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. Culturally, Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney suburbia, with Italian influences (which <b>are</b> <b>most</b> evident in Leichhardt to the east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which <b>are</b> <b>most</b> strongly evident in Ashfield to the West), and smaller influences from many other cultures.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that <b>are</b> <b>most</b> salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that <b>are</b> <b>most</b> frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012, {{after a week}} of {{conflict}} between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.

50|$|A review {{examined}} whether hold tests, {{best estimate}} or regression equation methods <b>were</b> <b>most</b> accurate in predicting overall IQ (full scale IQ) {{as determined by}} Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R) in a non-neurologically impaired population. It was found that different methods were more accurate depending on the IQ level of participants e.g. WRAT-3 (hold test) <b>was</b> <b>most</b> accurate for those of below average intelligence, NAART (hold test) <b>was</b> <b>most</b> accurate for those of average intelligence and the best estimate method <b>was</b> <b>most</b> accurate for above average intelligence. This provides support for the idea that no single method is superior in all cases and a combination of approaches <b>is</b> <b>most</b> appropriate in clinical practice.|$|R
