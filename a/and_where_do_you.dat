500|$|In 2009 Mehldau also {{recorded}} Highway Rider, an album that combined his usual trio with guest musicians and a 28-piece orchestra. Again based compositionally {{on the theme}} of travel or a journey, the album was produced by Brion, and, in critic Mike Hobart's description, [...] "probes the confluence of the arbitrary and non-arbitrary in music, of balancing what is committed to the page with improvisation." [...] This was pursued further in the winter of 2010–11, in public performances of pieces from the album in the US and Europe. Mehldau's trio returned to the studio {{for the first time in}} several years in 2008 and again in 2011, resulting in Ode, an album of the pianist's originals, <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> Start, an album of covers. Down Beat reviewer Jim Macnie commented that, on the former album, [...] "More than ever, Mehldau uses his instrument as a drum, popping staccato notes into the maw of the rhythm section's formidable bustle." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When {{they asked}} me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I was out of my mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. [...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is indeed--delightfully. <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>DO</b> <b>you</b> {{get your}} ways of saying things? It isn't anything--and the things aren't anything. But it's so droll." ...|$|E
2500|$|Question 4th. How, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{obtain the}} book of Mormon? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare, {{this is very}} sudden. But {{you have}} succeeded. Who made the suit? <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get all that pretty fringe and those {{beautiful}} beads?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come from?" [...] a voice asked, and Sergeant Corney {{took it upon}} himself, much to my relief, to act as spokesman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, young 'un," [...] one said, [...] "what's yer name, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from? Calcutta isn't {{much of a}} {{place for}} recruiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How dreadful!" [...] exclaimed Nelly. [...] "Who {{takes care}} of you, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> live? Without fathers and mothers you cannot have any home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she said, [...] "there is {{something}} about you, sir, which I do not understand. Who are you, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`What's your name, man, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come from, <b>and</b> {{how old are}} you, and how far can {{you jump}} without a race? and in fact I want to know all about you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quien sabe? The {{girls do}} not like me! The men do not care," [...] she declared. [...] "José took me by surprise, though, or I would have killed him. But who are <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not awake yet. It's {{twenty minutes}} past three," [...] {{and the man}} looked at his watch, as if to assure himself {{that he had made}} no mistake. [...] "Now, what is the matter, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave Harvey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think he}} is? At Darminster--editing a paper there. It {{is called the}} Darminster Politician. He said he sent a copy here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have enough}} for us all, Pigeonswing, and you shall have a full share. Now, tell me; what will be your next move, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> intend to pass the morrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who are you, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from?' {{said she}} {{to the little}} fish, whom the others had pushed in front. And in a low, {{trembling}} voice, the visitor told her story.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was there," [...] Lacy said. [...] "So {{you were}} the officer who charged through a {{squadron}} of our cavalry, accompanied by a single orderly! You certainly won your promotion fairly there. <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get your last step?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{came just}} in time," [...] replied Pan-at-lee; [...] "but who are <b>you</b> and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> know that I was here and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know of Om-at <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come from <b>and</b> what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean by calling Om-at, gund?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me! is that you, Pop?' exclaimed the ladies. 'What have <b>you</b> been <b>doing</b> with {{yourself}} all this time? Travelling, I suppose. Every one travels now. Really you travelled men get quite bores. <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get that coat, if it be a coat?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is your name, sir, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from?" [...] asked Mr. Mopes the Hermit--with {{an air of}} authority, but in the {{ordinary}} human speech of {{one who has been}} to school.|$|E
6000|$|Don. Louisa. Well, for all this, I {{would have}} sent him to plead his pardon, but that I would not yet awhile have him know of my flight. <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> hope to find protection? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Seven! I {{guess you}} {{had to pay for}} extra baggage. Shall I get you a carriage, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to be driven to--to your own house or the hotel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "M'Corkle!" [...] {{repeated}} Miss Montgomery, with a dissonant tone in {{her voice}} and a slight flash in her eyes. [...] "What are you thinking of? There never was a Mr. M'Corkle; {{it was one of}} my noms de plume. <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>YOU</b> hear it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE (seeing HUNT). Ha, a {{new face}}--and with a patch! (There's nothing under heaven I like so dearly {{as a new}} face with a patch.) Who the devil, sir, are you that own it? <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get it? <b>And</b> how much will you take for it second-hand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “My dear lad!” {{the admiral}} exclaimed, {{grasping}} his hand, “I gave {{you up for}} lost many months ago, and we have all mourned for you deeply. Where have you been? what have <b>you</b> been <b>doing?</b> what on earth have <b>you</b> <b>done</b> to yourself? <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get this extraordinary craft?” ...|$|R
6000|$|For some seconds {{they stood}} {{and looked at}} one another in silence, {{grasping}} their hands hard again and again with intense emotion; then Felix repeated his question a second time: [...] "Who are you, monsieur? <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter {{nodded his}} head in approval. [...] "You can always trust Old Mother Nature {{to know what is}} best," [...] said he sagely. [...] "By the way, Slaty, what do you make your nest of <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> put it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The reply fretted me. I wanted bare facts just then. [...] "Why {{are you so}} angry? What is your name? <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> live?" [...] It {{was my turn to}} ask questions, and I popped {{them out}} as if from a Little by Little.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] {{the young}} man assured her; [...] "but please {{remember}} that you are none the less heartily welcome here. We have few women neighbors, and intercourse with them seems to have slipped out of our lives.

6000|$|... "My good young man," [...] said King Pelias, {{taking the}} softest tone imaginable, {{in order to}} throw Jason off his guard, [...] "you are {{excessively}} welcome to my kingdom. Judging by your dress, you must have traveled a long distance, for {{it is not the}} fashion to wear leopard skins {{in this part of the}} world. Pray what may I call your name? <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> receive your education?" ...|$|R
5000|$|May 8: Smith {{spends the}} {{afternoon}} [...] "answering the questions {{proposed in the}} Elders Journal", {{one of which was}} [...] "How, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> obtain the book of Mormon?" [...] The answer, published in July 1838, states, [...] "Moroni, the person who deposited the plates from whence the book or Mormon was translated, in a hill in Manchester, Ontario County, New York, being dead, and raised again therefrom, appeared to me, <b>and</b> told me <b>where</b> they were..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am of Alsace," [...] said he; [...] "and, you know, {{they are}} more German than French. For myself, I have been in so many lands that I {{feel at home in}} all. I have been a great traveller; <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think that I might find a lodging?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{imprudent}} of you, Gertrude!" [...] she said. [...] "Not {{that it is}} {{your fault}} more than mine. I ought to have stopped you, but I did not think your voice would be heard through that thick curtain. Who are you, sir, <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from?" [...] she asked, turning to Ned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fair and softly, lad, else by {{too much}} haste you spoil the whole broth.

6000|$|... "I've {{been searching}} for Lucy, sir, night and day. I haven't slept a wink since I heard the awful news of her {{sickness}} <b>and</b> escape. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think she can be, sir?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Schenkkan {{describes}} All the Way as a {{play about}} [...] "the morality of politics <b>and</b> power. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> draw the line in terms of intentions and action. How much leeway does a good intention give you to violate the law?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, sir! Nonsense <b>you</b> said, <b>did</b> <b>you?</b> Your mother {{nonsense}}! This {{is the way}} {{to treat}} a parent, is it? I am nonsense, am I? I will teach you what nonsense is. Nonsense shall be very good sense; you shall find that, sir, that you shall. Nonsense, indeed! I'll write to your guardian, that I will! You call your mother nonsense, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>And</b> <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> learn that, I should like to know? Nonsense, indeed! This comes of your going to Cherbury! So your mother is nonsense; a pretty lesson for Lady Annabel to teach you. Oh! I'll speak my mind to her, that I will.' ...|$|R
