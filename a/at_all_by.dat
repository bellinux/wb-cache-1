5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful.

5|$|Tonelli was {{effectively}} an only child; his half-sister {{was not born}} until he was 14. A decade later, he discovered two half-sisters from his biological father's remarriage. His family moved around frequently due to his stepfather's work, before settling permanently in Brisbane. Tonelli's family had no history of athletic success, and had little knowledge of swimming, but his mother encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport to ease his asthma. In his first year, Tonelli came third in his age group at Western Districts Club, prompting his mother to send him at age nine to John Keatinga swimming coach who had guided several swimmers to national selectionat the Centenary Pool in the hope that he could improve to Olympic standards. Tonelli said the reality was that he could hardly swim <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>By</b> the age of 10, Tonelli was regularly winning at school carnivals and at 11, came seventh in the 100m freestyle in his division at the Queensland Championships, before winning the event the following year. Tonelli rates his win over Stephen Holland, the future 1500m freestyle world champion and world record holder, in a 200m freestyle race at a schoolboys' carnival as his favourite race. Holland was to break his first world record just a few months later.|$|E

25|$|As Tate's Lear {{disappeared}} from the stage (except when revived as a historical curiosity), and as critics were no longer faced with the difficulties of reconciling a happy ending on the stage with a tragic ending on the page, the expressions of indignation and disgust became less frequent, and Tate's version, when mentioned <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>by</b> modern critics, is usually mentioned simply as an interesting episode in the performance history of one of Shakespeare's greatest works.|$|E

Nathan Paget, his son and John's nephew, had already returned to pursue his career as a physician and lived in London throughout the English Civil War. He sustained the contacts with polyglot and polymath circles and the interest in Hebrew he had acquired from his uncle. He married Elizabeth Cromwell, cousin of Oliver Cromwell, and became a close friend of John Milton, sharing his interest in radical political and religious ideas. A distinguished member of the College of Physicians, his career was affected little if <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>by</b> the Restoration.|$|E
25|$|At Columbus' time, St. Martin was populated, if <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>by</b> Carib amerindians.

The Arawaks were agricultural people who fashioned pottery and whose social organization was headed by hereditary chieftains who derived their power from personal deities called zemis. The Caribs' territory was not completely conquered until the mid-17th century when most of them perished in the struggle between the French, English (later British), Dutch, Danes and Spanish for control of the West Indies islands around the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

Furthermore, the king would not again start an expedition relying heavily on mercenaries, and was hindered by starting any offense <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>by</b> {{the investigation of}} the Wesenberg incident and a few subsequent trials in Reval throughout 1574. Ivan IV seized the initiative until the Battle of Wenden (1578) turned the war's tide. In 1580, Sweden took Kexholmslän, and in the winter of 1580/81, Pontus de la Gardie led a Swedish army over the frozen Gulf of Finland, captured Wesenberg, turned to Narva which was taken on 6 September with the whole population slaughtered by the assailants, and until the end of 1581 sacked the last Russian strongholds in Estonia.|$|E

25|$|Various metres {{are used}} in the plays. As far as is known, the iambic senarii were spoken without music; trochaic septenarii (and also iambic septenarii and trochaic and iambic octonarii) were chanted or recited (or {{possibly}} sung) to the sound of a pair of pipes known as tībiae (the equivalent of the Greek aulos), played by a tībīcen ("piper"); and other metres were sung, possibly in an operatic style, to the same tibiae. In Plautus about 37% of lines are unaccompanied iambic senarii, but in Terence {{more than half of the}} verses are senarii. Plautus's plays therefore had a greater amount of musical accompaniment than Terence's. Another difference between the playwrights was that polymetric songs (using metres other than iambic and trochaic) are frequent in Plautus (about 14% of the plays), but hardly used <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>by</b> Terence.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of specimens, {{statistical}} analysis can be used to investigate this problem. In 2008 Chiappe et alii published a morphometrical study of 106 fossils. The population showed a clear bimodal distribution {{of the size of the}} animals with two weight classes. However, there was no correlation between size and the possession of the long tail feathers. From this it was concluded that either the sexes did not differ in size or both sexes had the long feathers. The first case was deemed most likely which left the size distribution to be explained. It was hypothesised that the smaller animals consisted of very young individuals, that the large animals were adults and that the rarity of individuals with an intermediate size was caused by Confuciusornis experiencing a growth spurt just prior to reaching adulthood, the shortness of which would have prevented many becoming fossilised during this phase. This interpretation was criticised by Dieter S. Peters who pointed out that, as the smaller animals were not neonates, the young of Confuciusornis had to grow very fast immediately after hatching regardless. This would then imply two growth spurts, which assumption was not very parsimonious. He thought the data would be more simply explained by assuming that both sexes had the long feathers and one of them was the largest. He favoured the possibility that these were the females, having observed such a pattern with the modern pheasant-tailed jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus), a water-bird in which both sexes have long tails and the female sex is the heaviest. He accounted for the fact that most specimens show no tails <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>by</b> the possibility that Confuciusornis shed the feathers as a defence mechanism, a method used by several extant species, which would have been triggered by the stress induced by the very volcanic explosion that buried the animals.|$|E
