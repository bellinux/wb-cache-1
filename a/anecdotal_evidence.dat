40|$|Adult orbital xanthogranulomatous {{disease is}} a group of rare orbital and ocular adnexal disorders, which is {{classified}} as class II non-Langerhans histiocytic proliferations. This disease can be classified into 4 subtypes based mainly on systemic involvement: adult-onset xanthogranuloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, Erdheim-Chester disease and adult-onset asthma and periocular xanthogranuloma. Diagnosis depends on its characteristic clinical manifestations and pathologic features. Therapeutic approaches are derived from <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidences,</b> which include corticosteroid, immunosuppressive agent, surgical debulking and chemotherapy. The management of this disease varies with different subtypes, as well as associated systemic presentations.

40|$|Commercialization of university’s {{research}} has drawn growing attention of late {{as it is}} increasingly seen as drivers to local economic growth. However, current studies have focused mainly on factors affecting commercialization assuming their presence would encourage greater commercialize activities. While this assumption is satisfactory, <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidences</b> indicated {{that the presence of}} those factors sometimes do not improve commercialization. We argued that this anomaly is due to the influence of university researchers’ perceptions toward commercialization which manipulate their propensity to engage in this activity. This paper begins by reviewing the various mechanisms to commercialization in Malaysia universities. The impact of perception on commercializing activities formed {{the second part of the}} analysis. Recommendations to enhance commercialization within a university environment are also highlighted...|$|R
5|$|Overall, <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} that temazepam {{may be the}} most psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E

In some cases groups of aborigines resisted colonial influence, but other groups and individuals readily aligned with the colonial powers. This alignment could be leveraged to achieve personal or collective economic gain, collective power over neighboring villages or freedom from unfavorable societal customs and taboos involving marriage, age-grade and child birth.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence,</b> including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|E

This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
40|$|Pharmacovigilance is {{the outcome}} of a natural and implied {{willingness}} of a physician to ensure safety to his patient. This is a discipline in medicine which pragmatises the principle of first do no harm towards a wider and systematic application in clinical practice. It is however important to understand that despite of its huge potential in ensuring a safe practice of medicine through knowledge of avoidable causes of adversities, its path has never been easy. Applying principles of pharmacovigilance into the realm of traditional medicine particularly to Ayurveda is even more difficult for the issues of why and how of pharmacovigilance in light of historical practice and <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidences</b> of safety in Ayurveda. Application of pharmacovigilance in Ayurveda thereby demands a careful and thoughtful observation of its needs and its methods of application in order to to maximize its impacts to ensure the patient safety to every extent possible...|$|R

Instead of examining entry advantage and disadvantage in isolation, entry momentum is introduced in this study to capture the net, differential advantages accompanying firm's tinting of entry. Entry timing is aligned with the stages of product life cycle to explicate that the first mover advantages could be sustained or lost depending upon variations in entry momentum, and the effectiveness of subsequent product strategy determines firm's market performance...|$|R

Implications of changes in business processes are reflected on the individuals’ job functions within businesses. IT is causing {{a major shift in}} pharmaceutical business paradigm. This shift can be observed in the changes in the traditional job functions of pharmacists. In this new paradigm, the Pharmacists are no longer perceived as just the “pill dispensers” but are viewed as the health consultants to the patients.

5|$|Timid and {{harmless}} to humans, the smalleye hammerhead {{is caught}} incidentally by inshore artisanal multispecies fisheries throughout its range, and marketed as food. It {{is the most}} or second-most important shark caught by such fisheries off Trinidad, Guyana, and Brazil. Because of its head shape, individuals of all ages are readily caught in gillnets; small numbers are also caught on line gear and in bottom trawls. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable, as it is subjected to intense fishing pressure and its low reproductive rate renders it susceptible to population depletion. <b>Anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that smalleye hammerhead catches have declined significantly off Trinidad and northern Brazil, which are likely indicative of population trends {{in the rest of}} its range. It is not the target of any conservation or management schemes.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E

Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous undersized fish, {{and may be}} avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball sinker commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works {{has yet to be}} proved, but <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer.

These factors arose from empirical research and were consolidated based on a literature review. This is a qualitative study whose data were collected in interviews carried out with 15 executives from different businesses in Brazil. The results showed that, while some Entrepreneurially Oriented practices can induce employees to adopt entrepreneurial behavior, autonomous behavior intrapreneurs are mostly stimulated by manager attitude.
