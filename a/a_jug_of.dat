25|$|Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, {{whom she}} later married. She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (<b>A</b> <b>Jug</b> <b>of</b> Punch, A Pinch of Salt and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True Love Knot also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> water and goblets on a tray.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E

500|$|On April 3, Presley {{made the}} first of two {{appearances}} on NBC's Milton Berle Show. His performance, {{on the deck of the}} USS Hancock in San Diego, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas. Twelve weeks after its original release, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests—"like <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> corn liquor at a champagne party," [...] wrote a critic for Newsweek. Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days. He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of [...] "Hound Dog", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became the new closing number of his act. After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. It warned that [...] "Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.... actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium.... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph." ...|$|E

2500|$|Trade {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} it was becoming necessary to double the railways. Attracting suitable labour was also a problem.

2500|$|Jieun {{returns to}} sing the second verse of the song with interchanging scenes from the {{abandoned}} building, the misty rice field {{and in the back}} seat of the car. Yongguk proceeds to rap in the misty rice field but this time his hands are tied up with ropes while sitting in a chair and blindfolded in the scene where he raps in front of a red wall. The video returns to the present where the woman has parked her car in a road near a rice field at night. When Jieun starts {{to sing the}} second chorus, the woman opens her car trunk in a straight-on view, revealing a captive man (Kim Him Chan) who had been blindfolded and tied up with rope. The woman takes <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> gasoline in the trunk of her car and kisses the man. She then pours gasoline on the prisoner and backs up a distance from the car. The video ends with the woman igniting her lighter and throwing it in the pool of gasoline. [...] The video ends before the car explodes.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{entering}} {{the house the}} man approaches the fireplace, called ognjište (...) —the hearth of an ognjište {{is similar to a}} campfire, in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon prosperity for the household. Any other logs are brought in by other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the first. The head of the household takes <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or similar. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. When the log has burnt through, some families let the fire go out, while in others the men keep watch in shifts during the night to keep the badnjak burning.|$|E

2500|$|Alternatively, or (in {{the opinion}} of some commentators) subsequently, Saul and David were {{reconciled}} following a similar occurrence when David was able to infiltrate Saul's camp on the hill of Hachilah and remove his spear and <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> water from his side while he and his guards lay asleep. In this account (1 Samuel 26), David is advised by Abishai that this is his opportunity to kill Saul, but David declines, saying he will not [...] "stretch out [...] hand against the Lord’s anointed". David shows, by removing Saul's spear, that he had chance to take Saul's life but did not do so. Saul confesses {{that he has been}} wrong to pursue David, blesses him and promises that he [...] "will do great things and surely triumph". David prays that his own protection will be like his protection of Saul. The New King James Version and the New International Version both identify this episode as a second reconciliation between Saul and David (with no account of any intervening dispute) but theologian Albert Barnes says the incident [...] "is of a nature unlikely to have occurred more than once". This, it seems, was their last interview; after this they saw each other no more.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Llewelyn Moss – while hunting {{antelope}} – stumbles {{across the}} aftermath of a drug deal gone awry which has left everyone dead but a single badly wounded Mexican who pleads with Moss for water. Moss responds that he does not have any and searches the rest of the vehicles, finding a truck full of heroin. He searches for the [...] "last man standing" [...] and finds him dead some ways off under a tree with a satchel containing $2.4 million in cash. He takes the money and returns home. Later, however, he feels remorse for leaving the wounded man and returns to the scene with <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> water only to find that the wounded man had since been shot and killed. When Moss looks back to his truck parked on the ridge overlooking the valley, another truck is there. After being seen, he tries to run which sparks a tense chase through a desert valley. This {{is the beginning of a}} hunt for Moss that stretches for most of the remaining novel. After escaping from his pursuers, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to her mother in Odessa, Texas, while he leaves his home with the money.|$|E
