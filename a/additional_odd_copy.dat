It is proven that the latter plays a key role in origin of perpendicular spin torque as well as for angular dependence character of all spin and charge transport considered.

30|$|The assumed shape {{method is}} chosen {{because it allows}} us to use the flat-plate modeshapes as the {{fundamental}} building blocks of the solution, thereby permitting observation of how the addition of the brace affects those fundamental modeshapes. This method also permits greater flexibility in analyzing the effects of changes in brace dimensions since it enables the creation of an analytical solution from which numerical solutions can be quickly obtained for various thicknesses of the brace. The equations of motion are derived using a computer algebra system (Maple). This yields mass and stiffness matrices where each matrix entry is a function of all physical parameters (dimensions, density, stiffnesses, etc.). The effect of any parameter on the system’s eigenvalues can then easily be examined without having to re-establish the entire system model. Using the assumed shape method, it has also been found that only two <b>additional</b> <b>odd</b> or even trial functions more than the one of interest are required for convergence (depending on whether it is itself odd or even). The finite element method was also considered. While the FE method offers significant advantages over the other approximate methods, namely its ability to model complex systems and boundaries and a high numerical accuracy, its disadvantage {{for the purpose of this}} work is its inability to make use of the known mode shapes of the system without the brace. Furthermore, the FE method also requires a large number of degrees of freedom in order for the solution to converge to accurate results. Contrary to the nature of the global functions approach, the finite element method uses local functions which extend over small subdomains of the system (Meirovitch 1996 b), thus comparison of the global behaviour to the exact solution of a simple plate problem cannot be directly incorporated into this solution approach.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have derived {{constitutive}} equations for the stress tensor of a viscoelastic material with anisotropic rigid particles. We {{have assumed that}} the material has fading memory. The expressions are valid for slow and small deformations from equilibrium, and for systems that are nearly isotropic {{in the absence of}} shear. For viscoelastic materials with fading memory the free energy depends not only on the deformation and degree of orientation in the current configuration, but also on the deformation and orientation history of the system. We have incorporated this dependence by incorporating a dependence on the relative Finger tensor and the alignment difference history in the expression for the free energy. We have used the entropy balance and the expression for the free energy to arrive at a set of fluxes and corresponding driving forces for this type of material. We have used this set of fluxes and driving forces to derive expressions for the stress tensor. We have calculated the explicit form of these expressions for a simple shear deformation in the xy-plane with shear rate γ̇. For fully isotropic materials the expression for the xy-component of the stress reduces to an equation containing only odd powers of γ. The inclusion of a non-zero value for the alignment difference history leads to an additional set of terms in the equation, all proportional to Qdxy (the xy-component of the alignment history tensor), and all proportional to even powers of γ. In a Fourier transform rheometry experiment the even powers of γ introduce small even harmonics in the frequency spectrum of the stress response. The expression for the first normal stress contains only even powers of γ, and the inclusion of the alignment difference history does not lead to additional harmonics in the frequency spectrum. For the second normal stress, inclusion of the alignment history leads to additional terms in the expression proportional to Qdyy and Qdxy. For an isotropic material the spectrum of the second normal stress contains only even harmonics. The terms proportional to Qdxy are all proportional to odd powers of γ, and will generate <b>additional</b> <b>odd</b> harmonics in the frequency spectrum...|$|R

For large contact resistances, R>>h/ 2 e 2, a SWCNT exhibits Coulomb blockade, and transmission can only occur, when a gate voltage leads to an energy degeneracy for two different number of electrons in the SWCNT. The Coulomb blockade gate voltage change is directly proportional to the addition energy for the single electron tunnelling. In certain ideal cases every second of the populated electronic states has a higher addition energy, indicating that two spindegenerate electrons are roomed at each orbital state.

40|$|The human {{salivary amylase}} genes display {{extensive}} copy number variation (CNV), and recent work has implicated this variation in adaptation to starch-rich diets, and {{in association with}} body mass index. In this work, we use paralogue ratio tests, microsatellite analysis, read depth and fibre-FISH to demonstrate that human amylase CNV is not a smooth continuum, but is instead partitioned into distinct haplotype classes. There is a fundamental structural distinction between haplotypes containing odd or even numbers of AMY 1 gene units, in turn coupled to CNV in pancreatic amylase genes AMY 2 A and AMY 2 B. Most haplotypes have one copy each of AMY 2 A and AMY 2 B and contain an <b>odd</b> number of <b>copies</b> of AMY 1; consequently, most individuals have an even total number of AMY 1. In contrast, haplotypes carrying an even number of AMY 1 genes have rearrangements leading to CNVs ofAMY 2 A/AMY 2 B. Read-depth and experimental data showthat different populations harbour different proportions of these basic haplotype classes. In Europeans, the copy numbers of AMY 1 and AMY 2 A are correlated, so that phenotypic associations caused by variation in pancreatic amylase copy number could be detected indirectly as weak association with AMY 1 copy number. We showthat the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay previously applied to the high-throughput measurement of AMY 1 copy number is less accurate than the measures we use and that qPCR data in other studies have been further compromised by systematic miscalibration.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a nonlinear coupling between a radial and a nonradial mode of {{nearly the same}} frequency. The results may be of general interest, but in particular have application to the "beating-modes model" of the Blazhko effect which was recently shown to accurately reproduce the light curve of RR Lyr. For weak coupling, the two modes do not phase-lock and they retain separate frequencies, but the coupling nevertheless has important consequences. Upon increasing the coupling strength from zero, an additional side-peak emerges in the spectrum forming an asymmetric triplet centered on the fundamental. As the coupling is further increased, the amplitude of this side-peak increases and the three peaks are also pulled towards each other, decreasing the Blazhko frequency. Beyond a critical coupling strength, phase-locking occurs between the modes. With appropriate choice of coupling strength, this "interactive beating-modes model" can match the side-peak amplitude ratio of any star. The effects of nonlinear damping are also explored and found to generate <b>additional</b> side-peaks of <b>odd</b> order. Consistent with this, the odd side-peaks {{are found to be}} favored in V 808 Cyg.

Script: In three main hands; hand changes back and forth several times as different sections of the text are supplied in different hands : hand [1] (p. 17 - 50) hand [2] (p. 51 - 52) hand [1] (p. 53 - 60) hand [2] (p. 61 - 82) hand [1] (p. 83 - 108) hand [2] (p. 109 - 141) hand [3] (p. 142 - 166) hand [1] (p. 167 - 192) hand [3] (p. 193 - 308); hand [1] Naskh, neat Syrian (?) hand, sans serif, mainly open counters, kāf mashkūlah preferred, rounded with occasional swooping descenders, the lām alif al-warrāqīyah preferred; hand [2] Naskh, small Syrian (?) hand, virtually serifless, quite rounded, mainly closed counters; hand [3] Naskh, bold Syrian (?) hand, mainly serifless, though occasional right-sloping head serifs on lām and free standing alif (or alif of lām alif ligature), strong vertical character, mix of open and closed counters, effect of slight variation in line thickness between horizontal and vertical strokes in a few instances; section headings appear in a fine tawqīʻ, occasionally highly ligatured (see fol. 85 b- 88 b/p. 170 - 176). Layout: Written in 19 to 21 lines per page; mainly single column, often divided to two columns or a narrower central column to set off verses of poetry; frame-ruled with impression of ruling board clearly evident.

Ms. composite codex. Ṣafadī, Khalīl ibn Aybak. Tamām al-mutūn fī sharḥ risālat ibn Zaydūn. (Cairo, 1969). Brockelmann, C. GAL,Odd copy of al-Ṣafadī's {{commentary on}} Ibn Zaydūn's famous epistle, al-Risālah al-Jiddīyah. Acephalous and incomplete with an arrangement inconsistent with that of published editions. Begins just before the 15 th قول of the epistle (see p. 67 of the 1969 Cairo ed.). Appears to have been assembled from roughly three manuscript copies. Mode of access: Internet. Acquired in 1926 from the bookseller Isaac Benjamin S. E. Yahuda via purchase transacted on his behalf by Abraham Shalom Yahuda (1877 - 1951), his younger brother. Inscription in black ink on fol. 71 b (p. 142) followed by signs and numerals, reads: "هاذى متن قصيدت ابن زيدون ۱۱۴۱" and thus would appear to be dated 1141 [1728 or 9]; numerous collation marks and statements in a variety of hands (see fol. 14 b/p. 28 "بلغ مقابلة بحسب الطاقة"); marginal corrections throughout...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} in decision-making has typically utilized hypothetical measures or simplified gambles {{to investigate the}} decisions people make. This method has been criticized as it lacks ecological validity and omits background knowledge and experience from the decision process. Mixed findings in the literature have emerged {{in terms of the}} effects positive and negative affect on risk-taking. The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) consolidates the mixed findings by incorporating factors that affect the extent to which affect is infused in the judgment process (i. e. experience). The current research examined the effects of mood on risk-taking in a decision task that allowed for background knowledge and experience; the game of poker. Three studies were conducted to test the predictions of the AIM using a novel methodology. Mood was manipulated in all three studies. Study 1 found evidence of the moderating role of experience in the relationship between affect and risk-taking in a hypothetical poker decision task. The decisions of more experienced participants were less infused with affect than less experienced participants. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 in a real-time poker task conducted in a laboratory setting. Study 3, using a similar design to Study 2, introduced a task incentive and an additional condition that provided real-time odds/expected value information during the decision task. An unexpected finding emerged with respect to the moderating role of experience in the relationship between affect and risk-taking. With the introduction of a task incentive, the decisions of more experienced participants were more infused with affect than less experienced participants during the first 20 minutes of the task. Evidence of a main effect of Mood and Odds Information was also found. An <b>additional</b> Mood X <b>Odds</b> Information effect on risk-taking emerged for decisions early in the decision task. The results obtained in the present research program are discussed with respect to their novel contributions to the decision-making and risk-taking literature...|$|R
