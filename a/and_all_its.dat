As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.|$|E

After settling into camps located between Gaza and Qastina, the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training, and many soldiers were granted leave. On 22 December, a formal parade involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.|$|E

5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{continuing}} external threats Gibraltar was {{neglected by}} the Spanish crown and its fortifications fell into disrepair. Barbary pirates from North Africa {{took advantage of}} the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The Shrine of Our Lady of Europe was sacked <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> valuables were stolen. Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by Bernardino de Mendoza intercepted the pirate ships near Alborán as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar. The Spanish crown belatedly responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the Charles V Wall to control the southern flank of the Rock and commissioning the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Calvi to strengthen other parts of the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> camps were closed by the summer of 1942.

5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E

The Zagreb Corps reported that the entire national border in its AOR was secured <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> Operation Storm objectives had been achieved.

In order to counterbalance the political influence of Transylvania's Hungarian minority, nationalist Romanians in Transylvania founded the Party of Romanian National Unity (PUNR) at {{the beginnings of the}} 1990s; the party was present in the Romanian Parliament during the 1992–1996 legislature. The party eventually moved its main offices to Bucharest and fell into decline as its leadership joined the ideologically similar PRM. In 2008, the Institute for Research on National Minorities, subordinated to the Romanian Government, opened its official headquarters in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons. This great perturbation may possibly be the reason why the satellite system of Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> moons seen in the satellite systems of all the other giant planets.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, the 4th Regiment was disbanded, its 1st Battalion {{assigned}} to the 1st Regiment {{and the rest of}} its manpower {{assigned to}} the 2nd Regiment. On 1 December 1942, the Corps was incorporated into the Wehrmacht <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> members were required to swear an oath to German leader Adolf Hitler. The Corps grew in numbers throughout 1942, following an influx of volunteers from Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Greece. By late 1942, the Corps totalled about 7,500 men, all of whom were Russian. During the re-organization, an attempt was made to expand the Corps further by recruiting Soviet POWs, but the first experiment with 300 POWs proved unsuccessful and was not repeated. On 9 December 1942, the 1st Regiment started to be transformed with the arrival of Kuban Cossacks led by Major General Naumenko. By January 1943, it consisted entirely of Cossacks. On 17 March 1943, Major General Gontarev replaced Shapilov as commander of the 3rd Regiment. The 1st Regiment fought in Loznica in April and participated in a large operation in Zapolje just south of Krupanj over the border with the NDH on 11–15 May, where it engaged in heavy combat with Partisan forces. From 1–8 July, the regiment was again stationed in Loznica and Ljubovija, participating in the defence of the Drina Bridge at Zvornik against the Partisans. During this time the regiment allowed the passage of 379 wounded Croatian soldiers and civilians, 1,000 healthy soldiers and as many refugees, sustaining casualties of two killed and seventeen wounded. It clashed with the Partisans over the village of Nedelica on 19 July. Meanwhile, the 2nd Regiment clashed with the Partisans around the town of Negotin. The 4th Regiment was re-established on 15 December, and was based in Jagodina, Paraćin and Ćuprija in the centre of the occupied territory.|$|E

5|$|Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has {{at times}} been {{considered}} basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered {{it to be}} inside Dinosauria. They supported this {{on the basis that}} Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} {{whether he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time.

He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
