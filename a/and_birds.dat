5|$|The first amniotes (clade of {{vertebrates}} {{that today}} includes reptiles, mammals, <b>and</b> <b>birds)</b> are {{known from the}} early part of the Late Carboniferous. By the Triassic, this group had already radiated into the earliest mammals, turtles, and crocodiles (lizards <b>and</b> <b>birds</b> appeared in the Jurassic, and snakes in the Cretaceous). This contrasts sharply with the (possibly fourth) Carboniferous group, the baphetids, which have left no extant surviving lineages.|$|E

5|$|Banksia flower spikes are {{important}} sources of nectar for mammals, insects <b>and</b> <b>birds,</b> particularly honeyeaters. Animals recorded foraging among the flower spikes of B.canei include the yellow-tufted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops), and bees, wasps and ants.|$|E
5|$|Banksia inflorescences are {{energy-rich}} {{sources of}} food, and B. aquilonia nectar is a likely food item {{of the endangered}} mahogany glider (Petaurus gracilis), {{as well as many}} other mammals <b>and</b> <b>birds.</b> Avian species observed visiting the flower spikes include the bridled honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, eastern spinebill and rainbow lorikeet.|$|E
