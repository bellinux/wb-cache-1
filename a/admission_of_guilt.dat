5|$|The {{cross-examination}} of him {{and other}} witnesses by Birkett swayed the jury, and they took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse {{admitted that he had}} in fact committed the murder– although he never gave a reason– it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> the identity of the victim has never been discovered.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} avenues of appeal {{available}} to the Bali Nine. Lawyers had seven days post-sentencing to lodge appeals. There is no time limit for those convicted to request clemency from the President of Indonesia, but this requires an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and had never been granted for a drug crime until 2009. All appealed to overturn their sentence. The sentences of Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after appeal. In May 2011, Rush's death sentence was reduced to life after he launched a final appeal in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|In May 1582, {{letters from}} the Spanish {{ambassador}} in England, Bernardino de Mendoza, to contacts in Scotland were found on a messenger by Sir John Forster, who forwarded them to Walsingham. The letters indicated a conspiracy among the Catholic powers to invade England and displace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. By April 1583, Walsingham had a spy, identified as Giordano Bruno by author John Bossy, deployed in the French embassy in London. Walsingham's contact reported that Francis Throckmorton, a nephew of Walsingham's old friend Nicholas Throckmorton, had visited the ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. In November 1583, {{after six months of}} surveillance, Walsingham had Throckmorton arrested and then tortured to secure a confession—an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> that clearly implicated Mendoza. The Throckmorton plot called for an invasion of England along with a domestic uprising to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, and depose Elizabeth. Throckmorton was executed in 1584 and Mendoza was expelled from England.|$|E
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{there are}} {{regulations}} {{related to the}} consequences of inconsistency in term <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> In New Jersey, the inconsistency of alternative facts in pleading {{may not be used}} as an admission against that party.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} {{understand}} Ursula's attitude. The girlish weakness, the submission to the highest authority in the land born of centuries of tradition, the maidenly bashfulness at the monstrosity of the accusation, were so many little feminine traits which at this moment appeared to him as so many <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b>|$|R

25|$|Darrow {{had hoped}} that a plea bargain (rather than an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in open court) would be all that was needed. But Los Angeles {{employers}} were worried that defense attorney Harriman would trounce Mayor Alexander on election day (December 5). Nothing short of an actual <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in open court would discredit Harriman and prevent his victory, and the employers were pressing hard for one.|$|E
25|$|Admission of guilt: if a {{declarant}} makes a statement, {{verbal or}} otherwise, as an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> {{of the matter}} at hand, that statement is admissible.

50|$|On April 7, 2011, LaGrotta {{pleaded guilty}} to {{altering}} prescriptions he had submitted to three different pharmacies, in two Pennsylvania counties, to obtain more of the anti-anxiety medication Xanax.

25|$|In {{the weeks}} before the jury was seated, Darrow became {{increasingly}} concerned about {{the outcome of the}} trial and began negotiations for a plea bargain to spare the defendants' lives. During the weekend of November 19–20, 1911, he discussed with pro-labor journalist Lincoln Steffens and newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps the possibility of reaching out to the Times about the terms of a plea agreement. The prosecution had demands of its own, however, including an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in open court and longer sentences than the defense proposed.|$|E
5000|$|These {{procedures}} may be {{constitutional and}} efficient, but they undermine key values served by <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in open court. —Stephanos Bibas, Cornell Law Review Stephanos Bibas writes in a 2003 analysis for Cornell Law Review that Judge Frank H. Easterbrook {{and a majority}} of scholars [...] "praise these pleas as efficient, constitutional means of resolving cases". Bibas notes that prominent plea bargain critic Albert Alschuler supports the use of this form of plea, writing, [...] "He views them as a lesser evil, a way to empower defendants within a flawed system. As long as we have plea bargaining, he maintains, innocent defendants should be free to use these pleas to enter advantageous plea bargains without lying. And guilty defendants who are in denial should be empowered to use these pleas instead of being forced to stand trial." [...] Bibas instead asserts that this form of plea is [...] "unwise and should be abolished". Bibas argues, [...] "These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in open court. They undermine the procedural values of accuracy and public confidence in accuracy and fairness, by convicting innocent defendants and creating the perception that innocent defendants are being pressured into pleading guilty. More basically, they allow guilty defendants to avoid accepting responsibility for their wrongs." ...|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of peace}} bonds is rather {{uncommon}} in the U.S. justice system, but a deferred prosecution {{has a similar}} effect. Since there is no conviction or <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> any <b>guilt,</b> signing a peace bond in Canada does not usually result in U.S. inadmissibility under INA § 212 (a) (2).|$|R
50|$|Vadim Rogovin's book 1937: Stalin's Year of Terror {{contains}} a lengthy discussion of another unexplained mystery: {{that it took}} only about two weeks to force <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> from the accused {{despite the fact that}} all of them were relatively young, able-bodied military trained people. Rogovin contrasts it with the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, where the inquest lasted about four years, despite brutal tortures. One possible explanation is that the Soviet commanders, after a life of military service, could not stand up psychologically to the position of opposing their commander-in-chief. Another is that the men may have been tricked into signing confessions in the belief that their lives or those of their families would be spared, a tactic sometimes employed by Stalin.|$|R
25|$|The {{committee}} {{takes the}} role of prosecutor, judge and jury when handling its cases. After the hearing is opened with a prayer, the accused is invited to make a personal statement. If there is no <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> the individual is informed {{of the source of}} the charges and witnesses are presented one at a time to give evidence. Witnesses do not remain present for the entire hearing. Once all the evidence is presented, the accused and all witnesses are dismissed and the committee reviews the evidence and the attitude of the accused.|$|E
25|$|Pashtunwali (or Pakhtunwali) {{refers to}} an ancient self-governing tribal system that regulates nearly all aspects of Pashtun life ranging from {{community}} to personal level. One of the better known tenets is Melmastia, hospitality and asylum to all guests seeking help. Perceived injustice calls for Badal, swift revenge. Many aspects promote peaceful co-existence, such as Nanawati, the humble <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> for a wrong committed, which should result in automatic forgiveness from the wronged party. These and other basic precepts of Pashtunwali continue {{to be followed by}} many Pashtuns, especially in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{the teams}} {{affiliated}} to FOCA threatened {{to withdraw from}} the race. The organizers of the event, the Real Automóvil Club de España (RACE), concerned that their race was in jeopardy, offered to pay a deposit on the fines owed by the drivers. The FISA refused any payment, unless RACE could prove that the deposit came from the drivers themselves (which would be an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> on the teams part). The King of Spain, Juan Carlos, insisted that RACE proceed with the event, and as a result RACE bypassed the Federación Española de Automovilismo, the Spanish motorsport federation, who were affiliated to FISA. With the race now not sanctioned by FISA, there was no requirement that the drivers hold a FISA racing licence.|$|E
40|$|Throughout its existence, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{has allowed}} {{defendants}} to settle cases without admitting to {{the allegations of}} wrongdoing. This “neither admit nor deny” policy has received heavy criticism by judges, Congress, and the public, especially {{in the wake of}} the 2008 financial crisis. On June 18, 2013, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White announced the agency’s intention to require <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in certain cases. While Chairman White did not articulate a clear standard <b>of</b> when <b>admissions</b> would be required, she did say that the agency would focus on the egregiousness of the defendant’s conduct and the harm to investors. This Article develops a model to help determine which settlements should require an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing. This model balances the costs of requiring admissions—in resources and litigation expenses, with the social benefits of requiring admissions—both in ensuring that the defendants are responsible for their actions and allowing the public to distinguish between technical violators and the more culpable offenders...|$|R
25|$|In October 2000, Komnas HAM {{released}} {{another report}} indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, {{should be investigated}} for their involvement; it called for an ad hoc tribunal {{to look into the}} matter further. With President Abdurrahman Wahid calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (islah) with victims' families; although the islah did not contain <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of Rp. 1.5-2 million (US$200–250). The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made. As a result of the islah, several victims or their families, suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped. However, investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003.|$|R
30|$|During these painful <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> Ms. A {{suffered}} from panic attacks with hyperventilation, which had occasionally appeared {{over the past}} few years. After the panic attack naturally subsided, Ms. A was able to recall some previously forgotten facts; namely, that “Mother tenderly thanked me for staying in a rest home.” Ms. A had, therefore, already been forgiven by her mother. After she recalled this fact, and felt its reality, she could also accept the many troubles that she had caused to her mother, and that had been denied. Ms. A recalled that she sometimes wished for her mother’s death. This discovery evoked excessive guilt toward her mother and her father. Ms. A understood with quiet sorrow that keeping this guilt was nonsensical in the face of her own sinful acts and forgiveness by her mother. Ms. A was convinced that she had been loved by her mother.|$|R
25|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, two {{competing}} visions for the post-war world emerged. The first was offered by the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), which called for a meeting in Bern, Switzerland, in July 1919. The Bern meeting would consider both {{the future of the}} IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the Central Powers as equals. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> for their countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in Paris which would only consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} slavery has {{received}} wide public and media attention {{in response to}} the bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. In this context, <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and apology are potent and confronting as they threaten to disrupt the collective self-understanding of Britain and Empire. As such, the silenced narrative of minority groups has found no place within the British cultural semantics for remembering Abolition. This paper will examine the rhetorical resources drawn upon in policy, media and public discourses to understand and soothe the traumatic history of the exploitation of African people, and uses critical discourse analysis to do so. The result, it will be argued, is a way of talking about the transatlantic slave trade which we have labelled the ‘abolition discourse’. The data used emerges from formal institutional talk (parliamentary debates and political speeches), media reporting and everyday talk (observed through a range of computer-mediated communication forums) ...|$|R

500|$|A {{conviction}} requires proof in one {{of three}} ways. [...] The first is an uncoerced confession. Alternatively, the testimony of two male witnesses can convict (four in the case of adultery), unless it is a hudud crime, in which case a confession is also required. Women's evidence normally carries half the weight of men in Sharia courts, however in criminal trials women's testimony is not allowed at all. Testimony from non-Muslims or Muslims whose doctrines are considered unacceptable (for example, Shia) may be discounted. Lastly, an affirmation or denial by oath can be required. Giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia's, and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> resulting in conviction.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, E. H.

[...] He {{concluded}} [...] "German men of learning set to work to demonstrate the guiltlessness of their country, fondly believing that, if this could be established, the whole fabric of the treaty would collapse." [...] René Albrecht-Carrié wrote in May 1940, that [...] "article 231 gave rise to an unfortunate controversy, unfortunate because it served to raise a false issue." [...] He wrote that the German inter-war argument [...] "rested on her responsibility for the out-break of the war" [...] and if that guilt could be disproved then the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.|$|E
5000|$|In a news interview, Murray says he {{went before}} a parole board four times, {{maintaining}} his innocence until the fifth: [...] "I said what the hell, {{let me tell}} these people {{what they want to}} hear."

Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. ... I became so desperate to get out, I had to say something. I had to say something because what I said before didn't work." [...] His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, Medwed's Second Look clinic, a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. Overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> at his parole hearings.|$|R

[...] <b>Admissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> were an integral part of witchcraft trials in Scotland and torture was often used until the practice was discontinued in 1708. Allison Balfour, who lived in an area of Stenness known as Ireland, had been asked for advice on how best to cast a spell on Patie by his brothers and friends who were plotting to kill him. Together with her aged husband, son and seven-year-old daughter, Balfour was subjected to extensive torture for forty-eight hours. She finally confessed but was found guilty of conspiring to murder by the use of witchcraft and was sentenced to be strangled and burned. On 16 December 1594 she was executed although she had retracted her confession.|$|R
