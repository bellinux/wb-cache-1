5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded <b>auroral</b> emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause <b>auroral</b> emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These transient phenomena {{are thought to}} be related to interaction with the solar wind. The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail. The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval {{may be related to the}} boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar <b>auroral</b> emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of <b>auroral</b> X-rays. The spectrum of the <b>auroral</b> X-ray radiation consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' <b>auroral</b> spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the <b>auroral</b> emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field lines, which Io crosses, couple Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere by generating an electric current {{known as the}} Io flux tube. This current produces an <b>auroral</b> glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this <b>auroral</b> interaction darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its <b>auroral</b> footprint with respect to Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian radio emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The Juno mission, currently in orbit around Jupiter, should help {{to shed light on}} these processes. The Jovian {{magnetic field}} lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn creates an induced magnetic field within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate magma ocean 50 kilometers beneath Io's surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by Galileo, generated within liquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.|$|E
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active <b>Auroral</b> Research Program.|$|E
5|$|Spots {{were found}} to {{correspond}} to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed {{in the vicinity of}} moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian <b>auroral</b> spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The Voyagers found aurora-like {{ultraviolet}} {{emissions of}} hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level <b>auroral</b> activity {{may lead to}} the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the solar wind's {{influence}} on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown; however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated solar activity. The <b>auroral</b> radio, optical and X-ray emissions, as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure, indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study <b>auroral</b> streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} with ESRO resulted in TSS providing telemetry for ESRO-IA, ESRO-IB, ESRO-2B, HEOS-1, HEOS-2, TD-1A and ESRO-4, {{all of which}} had low-Earth orbits. The two telemetry stations used {{a large portion of}} the Norwegian space budget, but became platforms which allowed for development of technology. Tromsø Satellite Station worked well in tandem with Andøya Rocket Range and became an international center for study of the <b>auroral</b> zone. The University of Tromsø was established in 1968 and started teaching in 1972. The same year, it took over the geophysical observatory and cosmic geophysics became one of the university's fields of excellence.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main <b>auroral</b> ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the <b>auroral</b> regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between the}} poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, he {{developed}} and published an <b>auroral</b> echo-scattering model {{to predict the}} obscuration of targets when the radar transmission path is through the <b>auroral</b> region.|$|E
25|$|Most auroras {{occur in}} a band known as the <b>auroral</b> zone, which is {{typically}} 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the <b>auroral</b> oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of <b>auroral</b> observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the <b>auroral</b> zone. Day-to-day positions of the <b>auroral</b> ovals are posted on the internet.|$|E
25|$|Auroras are {{occasionally}} seen in latitudes {{below the}} <b>auroral</b> zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the <b>auroral</b> oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common {{during the peak}} of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.|$|E
25|$|Auroras seen {{within the}} <b>auroral</b> oval may be {{directly}} overhead, but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, {{as if the}} Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the <b>auroral</b> zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be sub-visual.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} and brightest are the curtain-like <b>auroral</b> arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that <b>auroral</b> electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an <b>auroral</b> display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to <b>auroral</b> emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the <b>auroral</b> zone. The main findings have been that <b>auroral</b> arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auroral</b> radio {{emissions}} from giant planets with plasma sources, such as Jupiter's volcanic moon Io, could be detected with radio telescopes such as LOFAR.|$|E
25|$|A {{geomagnetic}} storm causes the <b>auroral</b> ovals (north and south) to expand, {{and bring the}} aurora to lower latitudes. It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000km away from the magnetic pole. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that <b>auroral</b> arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the aurora}} and {{associated}} currents produce a strong radio emission around 150kHz known as <b>auroral</b> kilometric radiation AKR, discovered in 1972. Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, {{have also been}} detected.|$|E
25|$|The altitudes where <b>auroral</b> {{emissions}} occur {{were revealed}} by Carl Størmer {{and his colleagues}} who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras. They discovered {{that most of the}} light is produced between 90 and 150km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000km.|$|E
25|$|On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes {{were able}} to determine, for the first time, the {{triggering}} event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third {{the distance to the}} moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to <b>auroral</b> intensification.|$|E
25|$|Electrons mainly {{responsible}} for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions {{perpendicular to the}} local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of <b>auroral</b> zone magnetic field lines. Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.|$|E
25|$|The high {{latitude}} magnetosphere {{is filled}} with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth {{and back into the}} solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the <b>auroral</b> zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an <b>auroral</b> glow.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Tromsø, as northern Norway {{is located in the}} <b>auroral</b> zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Tromsø is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.|$|E
25|$|The {{back of the}} 200kroner note shows a map of {{the north}} polar regions {{including}} Scandinavia to the right and northern Canada to the left. A ring encircling the magnetic dip pole (located near Resolute, Canada) symbolizes the location of <b>auroral</b> phenomena including the satellite-determined statistical location of Birkeland currents. Birkeland's original depiction of field-aligned currents published in 1908 is shown in the lower right corner.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrons}} {{responsible for}} the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the <b>auroral</b> atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature. The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.|$|E
25|$|Intense {{columns of}} <b>Auroral</b> {{ionization}} at 100km altitudes within the <b>auroral</b> oval backscatter radio waves, including those on HF and VHF. Backscatter is angle-sensitive—incident ray vs. magnetic field {{line of the}} column must be very close to right-angle. Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler-spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise-likedepending on how high radio frequency is used. The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes. The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (sub-storming phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly back-scatter mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} experiments, such as HAARP (High Frequency Active <b>Auroral</b> Research Program), involve high power radio {{transmitters}} {{to modify the}} properties of the ionosphere. These investigations focus on studying the properties and behavior of ionospheric plasma, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and military purposes. HAARP was started in 1993 as a proposed twenty-year experiment, and is currently active near Gakona, Alaska.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} latitudes, {{the effect}} {{is known as the}} Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind. The southern counterpart, the Aurora Australis or the Southern Lights, has features that are almost identical to the Aurora Borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern <b>auroral</b> zone. The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back {{many of the}} downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of <b>auroral</b> light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|The 'diffuse' aurora, on {{the other}} hand, is a {{relatively}} featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility. It can be distinguished from moonlit clouds {{by the fact that}} stars can be seen undiminished through the glow. Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical <b>auroral</b> display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.|$|E
25|$|The aurorae of Saturn {{are highly}} variable. Their {{location}} and brightness strongly {{depends on the}} Solar wind pressure: the aurorae become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar wind pressure increases. The bright <b>auroral</b> features are observed to rotate with the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by the aurorae is about 50GW in the far ultraviolet (80–170nm) and 150–300GW in the near-infrared (3–4μm—H3+ emissions) parts of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Images of auroras are {{significantly}} more common today {{than in the}} past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities. Film and digital exposure to <b>auroral</b> displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectrum present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration of <b>auroral</b> charged {{particles}} invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which {{is believed to}} predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle {{in the direction of}} the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.|$|E
