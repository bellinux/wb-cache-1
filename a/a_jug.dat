5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, <b>a</b> <b>jug,</b> a hook.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E
5|$|Some 500fragments {{of pottery}} were found {{dating from the}} medieval period. Most of these were parts of jars, jugs or pipkins and {{were found in the}} area of the kitchen range. Most of it was {{produced}} locally, although 13sherds of Stamford Ware, fragments of two jugs from North France, and two small pieces of Saintonge pottery have been identified. Only a few wooden bowls were recovered. Much more pottery was found dating from the post-medieval period and later. Again most of this had been manufactured in England, especially in Staffordshire. Fragments of pottery from abroad included pieces from a Westerwald mug, <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> from Cologne and items of Chinese porcelain. The excavations produced over 4,000sherds of glass, dating from the 12th to the 20thcenturies, but only 16 of these came from the period before the dissolution. A total of 1,170fragments from clay tobacco pipes were found, dating from about 1580 to the early 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E

The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at Godin Tepe in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran, where fragments of <b>a</b> <b>jug,</b> from between 5400 and 5000 years ago was found to be coated with beerstone, a by-product of the brewing process.|$|E
25|$|Blowing {{over the}} edge of <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> or bottle can create a nearly pure tone of low frequency. The driving force is the flow over the jug edge so one might expect an edge tone dipole sound field. In this case, The {{curvature}} and roundness of the edge makes a strong edge tone unlikely. Any periodicity at the edge is likely submerged in the Class III feedback from the jug volume. The unsteady edge flow sets up a classical Helmholtz resonator response in which the interior geometry and the jug neck determines the resultant frequency. A resonance equation is shown below.|$|E

25|$|Canned Heat {{was started}} within the {{community}} of blues collectors. Bob Hite had been trading blues records since his early teens and his house in Topanga Canyon was a meeting place for people interested in music. In 1965 some blues devotees there decided to form <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> band and started rehearsals. The initial configuration comprised Bob Hite as vocalist, Alan Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass and Keith Sawyer on drums. Perlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist Kenny Edwards (a friend of Wilson) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to sit in on drums until they could find a permanent drummer.|$|E
25|$|Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, {{whom she}} later married. She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (<b>A</b> <b>Jug</b> of Punch, A Pinch of Salt and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True Love Knot also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has <b>a</b> <b>jug</b> of water and goblets on a tray.|$|E
