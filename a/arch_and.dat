5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould. On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century <b>arch,</b> <b>and</b> the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E

5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy.

5|$|In 1937 it {{appointed}} the architect Percy Thomas to produce designs. He proposed a new American-inspired station that would involve removing or re-siting the <b>arch,</b> <b>and</b> included office frontages along Euston Road and a helicopter pad on the roof. The redevelopment work began on 12 July 1938, when 100,000 tons of limestone was extracted {{for the new}} building and some new flats constructed to rehouse people displaced by the works. The project was then shelved indefinitely because of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing <b>arch,</b> <b>and</b> also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish {{architect}} George Wittet {{combined the}} elements of the Roman triumphal <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> the 16th-century architecture of Gujarat. The monument's design is a combination of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles. The arch is of Muslim style while the decorations are of Hindu style. The Gateway of India is built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The stone was locally obtained, and the perforated screens were brought from Gwalior. The gateway faces out to Mumbai Harbour from the tip of Apollo Bunder.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the main facade, with its dominant drawn-out and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts, reflects the internal division into three naves. At ground-floor level, the front was distinguished by the three-arch entrance and bifora, whereas the first-floor level had a high triforium with an elevated <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first pharyngeal <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> usually attached to {{the spine of the}} sphenoid bone, may be found attached to the rim of the foramen.|$|E

5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic <b>arch,</b> <b>and</b> the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} <b>arch,</b> <b>and</b> then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic <b>arch,</b> <b>and</b> passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the <b>Arch</b> <b>and</b> the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural <b>arch</b> <b>and</b> filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
