5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the fictional}} New England town {{of the same}} name, Bizenghast focuses on fifteen-year-old Dinah Wherever. Her parents' car crash leaves her {{orphaned}} at a young age, and as a result, she moves in with her aunt. Dinah can see the ghosts which haunt her aunt's house, which was a hospital and later a boarding school; however, her aunt and doctor believe that she suffers from schizophrenia. One day, she and her only friend, Vincent Monroe, sneak out of her aunt's house to search for materials for his garden. They stumble across an ancient mausoleum, and after Dinah reads aloud from a plaque, she discovers that her name is written on a contract which binds her {{to return to the}} mausoleum every night to free the ghosts. If she succeeds, she will win her freedom and a reward. If she fails, she will die <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mausoleum as a corpse.|$|E
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time}} and with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E

25|$|Until 1962, all Commonwealth {{citizens}} {{could enter}} <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962 and Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1968 to tighten immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|In the November 1860 Presidential election, Kentucky voters gave native Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln {{less than}} one percent of the vote. Kentuckians did not like Lincoln, because he stood for the {{eradication}} of slavery and his Republican Party aligned itself with the North. But, neither did they vote for native son John C. Breckinridge and his Southern Democratic Party, generally regarded as secessionists. In 1860, people in the state held 225,000 slaves, with Louisville's slaves comprising 7.5 percent of the population. The voters wanted both to keep slavery <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Union.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{feeling that}} {{membership}} of the Alliance had subsumed their identity, the Greens took the decision to stand candidates independently of the Alliance at the next election. While most of the Green party members left the Alliance, some decided instead to leave the Green Party <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alliance (notably MP Phillida Bunkle). Conversely, some of the Alliance party members who joined the Alliance via other parties {{decided to leave the}} Alliance and join the Green Party, notably Sue Bradford and Keith Locke, who both joined the Alliance via NewLabour.|$|E
25|$|Penalties can {{be either}} {{technical}} or personal. Personal fouls such as cross-checking, illegal body check or slashing, are mostly about player safety. These fouls draw 1-minute or more penalties; the offending player must leave the field <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> substitution area {{for the length of}} the penalty. His team plays with nine players for the duration. Because of the offsides rule, this means the opponent plays with six attackers versus five defenders plus the goalie. Technical fouls, such as offsides, pushing, and holding, result in either a turnover or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball.|$|E

The couple evangelized widely, starting a campus church and secret bible school in Fangshan District, Beijing. On May 9, 1996, the couple was detained for running a Christian training center in Fangshan District, Beijing and for illegal evangelizing. On July 8, they left detention in good health, having been reportedly treated well but warned not to engage with foreigners.

25|$|The {{government}} {{launched a}} voluntary evacuation program in December 1943 which encouraged old people, {{children and their}} mothers {{to move from the}} main cities <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homes of friends and relatives in rural areas. The government provided civilians with little assistance to evacuate, however. Few people evacuated until the first raid by American heavy bombers on Japan, an attack on Yawata, in June 1944 after which the government urged families to evacuate their children. As a result, 459,000 children and their parents moved to stay with friends and relatives. For families without contacts in the countryside, entire school classes evacuated as groups accompanied by their teachers; by August 1944, 333,000 children had been relocated to rural areas where they continued their education in inns, temples and other public buildings. A further 343,000 urban residents were forced to leave their homes when they were destroyed to create firebreaks; these people either moved to the country or lived in temporary accommodation near their workplace.|$|E
500|$|Mid May 2012, {{the crisis}} and impossibility {{to form a new}} {{government}} after elections and the possible victory by the anti-austerity axis led to new speculations Greece would have to leave the eurozone shortly due.

500|$|The {{traditional}} {{theory is}} that a cold can be [...] "caught" [...] by prolonged exposure to cold weather such as rain or winter conditions, which is how the disease got its name. Some of the viruses that cause the common colds are seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold or wet weather. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air longer.|$|E
500|$|She {{acknowledges}} the struggles for equality that women riders in earlier generations {{had to face}} were greater than her own, but notes that women jockeys still [...] "fight a battle." [...] In her early career, she simply tried to [...] "blend in" [...] with the male riders, but nonetheless encountered some owners and trainers who refused to hire a female jockey. She later said, [...] "I was very conscious when I raced against their horses—and when I beat them." [...] Napravnik has encountered harassment from male jockeys on the track when other riders would deliberately bump her or pen in her horse from all sides. [...] In a 2013 interview with 60 Minutes, Napravnik said that she has heard hecklers at the track yell at her to [...] "go home and have a baby," [...] or [...] "go home <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen." [...] She repeatedly has chosen to make her mark on the track instead of getting into post-race fights. [...] Trainer Larry Jones, having witnessed other jockeys deliberately bumping into her on the track, commented, [...] "Don't do Rosie that way, because she will run over you.

500|$|Oxford United {{finished}} eighteenth in the 1985–86 First Division, avoiding relegation on {{the last}} day of the season after defeating Arsenal 3–0. They also won the Football League Cup, known at the time as the Milk Cup under a sponsorship deal. As winners, Oxford would have qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup, had it not been for the ban on English teams that had resulted from the previous year's Heysel Stadium disaster. After beating fellow First Division side Aston Villa in the semi-final 4–3 on aggregate, Oxford faced Queens Park Rangers in the final, which was held at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1986. The game finished 3–0 with goals from Trevor Hebberd, Ray Houghton and Jeremy Charles. After the match long-serving physiotherapist, 72-year-old Ken Fish, collected one of the winners medals, instead of manager Maurice Evans. Evans felt that Fish deserved the medal for his service to the club, and so gave him his, in what was seen as an [...] "unprecedented gesture". It was the last time the League Cup was played under the name [...] "Milk Cup", sponsors Littlewoods taking over the following season. The 1986–87 season saw Oxford United narrowly avoid relegation <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First Division. Robert Maxwell resigned as chairman in May 1987, to take over at Derby County, handing the club to his son Kevin. Maurice Evans was sacked in March 1988 with Oxford bottom of the First Division.|$|E

500|$|The band began {{recording}} demos of {{new material}} in 2009. All three members brought song ideas that {{they worked on}} for years. As the band got back together, Barker said that the trio immediately [...] "got inspired" [...] by practicing their old songs and listening to them again, {{and they decided to}} record demos. There were four demos done, and only one was near completion, [...] "Up All Night". The trio wanted to release it as a single then, but quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in July. Sessions were stalled by the summer 2009 reunion tour, during which the band reconnected musically and emotionally. During the tour, Barker got the phone call that DJ AM had overdosed and died in New York, which heavily affected him. In addition to the tragedy regarding DJ AM, DeLonge was diagnosed with skin cancer the following year, but it eventually was cleared. The band did a large amount of writing before leaving on tour, but upon completion of the tour, they took time off to [...] "take a couple of months and chill and do other stuff," [...] with intentions to regroup in 2010. In June and July 2010, the band spent time at their rehearsal spot, and their intention was to wrap up touring by September, <b>and</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio {{for the rest of the}} year until the album was finished. The album sessions were to be partially documented in The Blinkumentary, which was scrapped in 2012.|$|E

Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not sure if the defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!" [...] He finished the season with 11 appearances and 1 goal for Wrexham, with opportunities in the team again being rare.|$|E
