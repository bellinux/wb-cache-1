25|$|Bayt Dajan {{was one of}} {{at least}} eight villages {{destroyed}} by Israel's First Transfer Committee between June and July 1948 {{under the leadership of}} Joseph Weitz.

On 23 September 1948 General Avner named Bayt Dajan as a suitable village for resettlement for new Jewish immigrants (olim) to Israel. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. Four villages, Beit Dagan (established six months after the conquest), Mishmar HaShiv'a (1949), Hemed (1950) and Ganot (1953) were later established on land that had belonged to the Bayt Dajan.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, the {{fraternity}} issued <b>a</b> <b>progress</b> <b>report.</b> Significant improvements {{have occurred in}} many areas of fraternity life and operations. Since the implementation of the alcohol free housing policy, the all undergraduate grade point average rose from 2.77 in 2000 to nearly 3.00 in 2005. The insurance premiums of individual members have also gone down as risk management violations have decreased. Perhaps the most telling area is in membership, where Phi Delta Theta showed an increase of new members. In 2004, Phi Delta Theta had 3,102 new members while other fraternities averaged 2,415. In 1990, chapters of Phi Delta Theta were 18% larger than the typical fraternity chapter. In 2004, they were 30% larger. Also, in 2004, Phi Delta Theta was one of only 13 national/international fraternities to show an increase in total undergraduates from the previous year with an increase of 4.2%. The significance of this is highlighted by the fact that Phi Delta Theta had fewer chapters than other fraternities. Competitively, Phi Delta Theta has remained a constant among others. In terms of new members, it ranked ninth in 1990, eighth in 2000, and ninth in 2004. Many alumni members have credited the alcohol free housing policy in continuing this trend.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Ron and {{the others}} deal with their meetings: April acts as uninterested as possible, Andy makes {{promises}} to people against Ron's wishes, and Ann provides several medical consults after revealing she is really a nurse (not a parks and recreation department employee). Although the two had previously been developing a romantic interest, Andy now acts uninterested in April because he feels uncomfortable about the eight-year age difference between them, further upsetting April on a difficult day. Ron, who views the many meetings as an utter nightmare, calls in the others {{during the middle of}} the day for <b>a</b> <b>progress</b> <b>report,</b> and angrily berates April for her mistake. After all the meetings, April arranges her own meeting with Ron, where she announces she is quitting. When Andy learns this, he convinces Ron that April is a great assistant. Ron goes to April's house and convinces her to come back by telling her about Andy's compliments. April then reveals that she knows Ron is Duke Silver, since her mother is a huge fan, and that she recognized him the first time that they met. On her first day back, April successfully scares off someone wanting to meet with Ron by scheduling absurd meeting dates and times such as June 50th, the [...] "one-teenth" [...] of [...] "march-tember" [...] and 2:65 PM. Ron gives her an approving smile and nod while watching from his office.|$|E
