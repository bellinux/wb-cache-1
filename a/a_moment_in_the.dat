25|$|I {{think of}} Ligonier as <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Orthodoxy in North America when {{a love for}} the missionary mandate of the Gospel transcended ethnic and {{cultural}} barriers and concerns. Ligonier provided a venue where Orthodox bishops offered words and visions of ecclesial unity. Ten years ago, the prophetic spirit of Ligonier stood opposed to jurisdictional pluralism even when other hierarchs, here and abroad, sought to justify the uncanonical status quo. Ten years ago, the bishops of Ligonier expressed a oneness of mind which exposed the falsehood that jurisdictional pluralism does not impede Eucharistic unity when, in fact, the presence {{of two or more}} bishops in one city undermines the very reality of ecclesial and, therefore, Eucharistic unity.|$|E

500|$|Part of {{the story}} {{involves}} the character Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), a Florentine policeman who learns [...] "Dr. Fell"'s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate {{the death of a}} gypsy pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife. There is <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as [...] "very thoughtful". Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption. Starling does not, however, and perseveres to the end, even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E
500|$|The play's [...] "greatest charm is the {{character}} of Imogen", writes Hazlitt. He observes how, in justifying her actions, [...] "she relies little on her personal charms" [...] or a prudish [...] "affected antipathy to vice" [...] but rather [...] "on her merit, and her merit is in the depth of her love, her truth and constancy." [...] Shakespeare's presentation is full and rounded. We see her beauty as observed by others (as by the villain Iachimo), but more often we see her from the inside, and are touched when, after endless nights of crying herself awake {{over the loss of}} Posthumus, she is outraged to learn (as she is falsely informed) that Some Jay of Italy [...] hath betrayed him. And we witness <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of her character, as her resolve to disguise herself to seek out Posthumus grows firmer. [...] "Of all Shakespear's women she is perhaps the most tender and most artless." ...|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the game's release, LucasArts {{announced}} development on two downloadable expansion packs for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The first expansion added [...] "skins" [...] that allow the player's character to appear as Star Wars figures other than Starkiller, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Qui-Gon Jinn, Jango Fett, C-3PO, Luke Skywalker, Darth Maul, Darth Sion, Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Kit Fisto and Ki-Adi-Mundi. The skins chosen {{to be part of}} the expansion were based in part on fans' feedback. The second expansion pack added a new mission that expands on Starkiller's background. Although <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game's main story was considered as a [...] "jumping off point" [...] for the expansion, LucasArts decided instead to make the new mission instantly accessible to players. The mission's location— the Jedi Temple on Coruscant— appears in the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions of The Force Unleashed, but was cut during planning from the PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms.|$|E
500|$|The {{design team}} for the series {{conceived}} eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's [...] and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti. Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes [...] "wouldn't be possible in real life". [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode," [...] Jean resumed, [...] "when she starts out with her hair down. Then, there's a curtain pulled in front of her, and in seconds, she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy. In real life, that would probably take 8 hours." [...] Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn, including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress. [...] "We {{did a lot of}} research, looking back at her old outfits, and she's really been in a million different things, had a million different looks." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also {{said that it was}} great to work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have the interaction between the Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like [...] "mum and dad arguing over directions in the car". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there is <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{has also}} been put on several top ten lists for 2011. Time {{reviewer}} James Poniewozik named the episode the second best television episode of 2011 calling the episode [...] "pitch-perfect". The A.V. Club named the episode among the top 2011 TV highlights. David Sims wrote that [...] "Although {{every member of the}} ensemble gets <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun, Michael’s silent airport farewell to Pam [...] works best of all, a testament to the audience's deep understanding of these characters". Daniel Feinberg named Carell's final episodes for The Office the 20th-best television episodes of 2011, although he only named Carell's final episodes under the banner. He mainly praised Carell's performance for switching from both laughs to sadness with a nuance. TV Guide named the episode the 12-best episode of 2011 and compared the episode to the humor of the series calling it [...] "understated and pitch-perfect". [...] "Goodbye, Michael" [...] was voted the highest-rated episode out of 24 from the season, according to an episode poll by the fansite, OfficeTally. In another poll, the episode was voted the fourth highest-rated episode of the series, out of 139, receiving 403 votes.|$|E
500|$|In {{one scene}} of [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Weevil (Francis Capra) accuses Logan (Jason Dohring) of having hit Lilly during their relationship. The series' writers were {{planning}} to develop that plot strand into a storyline, with it eventually being revealed that Duncan had hit Lilly in an epileptic fit. However, the storyline was abandoned {{in order to make}} time for other story arcs. Thomas commented, [...] "At the end of the day, I don't want people thinking that Logan hit Lilly. I did, however, want Weevil to believe it." [...] Although Veronica concludes in this episode that she had consensual sex with Duncan while they were both under the influence of roofies, more information about the night is later revealed in the show's second season finale, [...] "Not Pictured", in which it is revealed that Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas raped her. When asked whether the writers knew that Beaver would be eventually revealed as the rapist when writing [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Thomas responded, [...] "I wish I could claim that we were that clever." [...] The writers realized that there was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode's script where Beaver could have raped Veronica roughly a month after its airing.|$|E
500|$|Lasser {{provided}} {{ideas to}} his authors and commented on their drafts, attempting to improve both {{the level of}} scientific literacy {{and the quality of}} the writing. Some of his correspondence has survived, including an exchange with Jack Williamson, whom Lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader—the winning entry in one of the magazine's competitions. Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility, citing as an example <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language: [...] "You must be sure and make it convincing how they did it; for they have absolutely no method of approach to a written language of another world." [...] On one occasion Lasser's work with his authors extended to collaboration: [...] "The Time Projector", a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Wonder Stories, was credited to David H. Keller and David Lasser. Both Lasser and, later, Hornig, were given almost complete editorial freedom by Gernsback, who reserved only the right to give final approval to the contents. This was in contrast to the more detailed control Gernsback had exerted over the content of Amazing Stories in the first years of its existence. Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz has suggested that the reason was the poor financial state of Wonder Stories—Gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money.|$|E

Desmond, wanting to prove that he is not a coward, travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world, sponsored by Charles Widmore. He meets Libby (Cynthia Watros) in a cafe, and after a deep conversation, Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband. While Desmond is training, Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him. (There is <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run.) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore's race and promises that he will return. However, while sailing, Desmond gets caught in a bad storm, and washes up on the island.

Desmond violently confronts Inman about this, accidentally killing him in the process. After almost letting the countdown timer run down, Desmond starts drinking liquor and contemplates suicide. Before he shoots himself however, he hears John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) banging on the hatch door, and turns on a light.

2500|$|Lacan's first {{official}} contribution to psychoanalysis was the mirror stage, {{which he described}} as [...] "formative of {{the function of the}} I as revealed in psychoanalytic experience."

In [...] "the Imaginary order," [...] their own image permanently catches and captivates the subject. Lacan explains that [...] "the mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body-image".|$|E
2500|$|American author Ralph Ellison wrote {{a tribute}} to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel Invisible Man. According to Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad, the {{character}} of the narrator [...] "resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick". Ellison acknowledges his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana, and evocates a church service: [...] "Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'" [...] In this scene Ellison [...] "reprises <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford {{looking for a place to}} spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: [...] "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there." [...] According to Rampersad, it was Melville who [...] "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition" [...] by his example of [...] "representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text".|$|E
