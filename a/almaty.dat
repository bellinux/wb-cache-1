5|$|From <b>Almaty</b> in Kazakhstan, {{the railway}} extends to Tashkent and Samarkand, Uzbekistan {{and then to}} Tejen, Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with its neighbors).|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of <b>Almaty</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February in Vikersund, Prevc won {{the event}} despite sliding upon landing (he {{remained}} {{on his feet}} nevertheless), which rarely happens in ski jumping. By winning the second event in <b>Almaty</b> on 28 February, Prevc secured his first World Cup title, six events {{before the end of}} the season. At the end of the season, Prevc broke several statistical records. He won the highest number of points, victories, and podium finishes in a single season (2303 points, 15 victories and 22 podiums in total, the previous records being 2083 points, 13 victories, and 20 podiums by Gregor Schlierenzauer from the 2008/09 season). Other records include the point difference between the first and the second in the overall standings (813), the best average of points per event (79.4), and the highest number of points in the Four Hills Tournament (1139.4). By winning the ski flying title, Prevc became the first ski jumper to win the title for three years in a row.|$|E
5|$|Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow {{occurs in}} six {{probably}} disjunct areas, and {{is divided into}} at least three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another {{to the south of}} Lake Balkhash and the north of <b>Almaty,</b> where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus. The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.|$|E
