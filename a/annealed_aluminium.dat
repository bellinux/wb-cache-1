40|$|Creep {{tests at}} room {{temperature}} under combined tension-torsion have been performed on thin walled tubes of commercially pure aluminium (ElA) in the annealed, extruded and prestrained conditions. The required creep stresses were achieved by incremental loading along a constant stress ratio path (radial loading). Axial ([epsilon][sub]zz) and shear ([gamma][sub][theta]z) strains were measured throughout deformation. Strains produced by radial loading on annealed and extruded aluminium consisted of an instantaneous component and a short-time creep component. For all stress paths the latter component was the form [epsilon][alpha]t[sup]m where the time exponent m lay in the parabolic range [omicron]<m< 1 / 2. The plastic prestraining of <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> was either beneficial or detrimental to its combined tension-torsion creep resistance. Forward prestrains (in tension or positive torsion) or large reversed prestrains (in compression or negative torsion) were beneficial to creep resistance by hardening the aluminium {{in the direction of}} the stress path. The effect was to eliminate the short-time creep component of radial loading and to reduce the primary creep strains and secondary creep rates of ensuing long-time creep. Small amounts of reversed prestrain were detrimental to creep resistance by softening the aluminium {{in the direction of the}} stress path. The effect was to increase the parabolic creep component of radial loading (m lowered) and to increase the primary creep strains and secondary creep rates of ensuing long-time creep. Experimental observations on flow behaviour were not in agreement with predictions from isotropic theory. The anisotrophy in the three conditions of aluminium was examined in the instantaneous plastic strain increment vector of loading (d[gamma][sup]P[sub][theta]z/d[epsilon][sup]P[sub]zz) and in the strain rate vector of short and long-time creep ([gamma][sub][theta]z/[epsilon][sub]zz). For each stress path on <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> the colinearity in these vectors indicated an initially anisotropic material which hardened uniformly throughout deformation. Stress paths on extruded aluminium produced rotations in the initial instantaneous vectors of loading while stress paths on prestrained aluminium produced rotations in the instantaneous vectors of loading and in the strain rate vectors of long-time creep. With increasing stress of loading or with accumulating creep strain the vectors rotated into colinearity. The behaviour was typical of the nature of anisotropic hardening in material possessing a strain history. Plastic strain increment ratios derived from the yield functions of Edelman and Drucker f= 1 / 2 C[sub]ijkl([sigma]ij-m[epsilon][sup]P[sub]ij) ([sigma]kl-m[epsilon][sub]kl) and Yoshimura the three conditions of aluminium. Hill’s yield function f= 1 / 2 C[sub]ijkl[sup]sigma][sub]ij[sup][sigma][sub]kl was descriptive of the plastic anisotrophy in uniform hardening. This led to an extension of each theory for creep. In general strain rate ratios derived from the extended theories were in good agreement with observations on creep anisotrophy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} {{in heavily}} deformed metals {{can be characterized}} as a complex “mixture ” of low and high angle boundaries. By careful annealing of such cold deformed conditions, ultra-fine grained materials can be obtained. This phenomenon has been known for long and utilised in the production of special aluminium sheet qualities, and has received new interest with the emergence of the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) technique.

Up to approximately 16 % cold reduction ro, r 454 and r 901 remained approximately constant, while the average strain-ratio, r, showed no change. At cold reductions in excess of 16 % ro, and rgo, fall steadily, while the fall in r 4 s, is less pronounced. Specimens were then 'electromarked' with an array of 0. 1 in. dia. circles and bulged, using a pvc 'punch' technique. Plots of natural thickness strain (e) vs. bulge height (h max) show that, for a given height, the strain distribution is more even for an annealed material than for a cold-worked one, due to the effect of work-hardening. The relationship between polar thickness strain and uniaxial uniform elongation (eu) shows a discontinuity at about 10 % eu and a further plot of h and r against eu suggests that this is associated with the change in strain-ratio. Thus, bulge height increases linearly with increasing uniform elongation at a constant strain-ratio, but in a more complex fashion with varying strain-ratio. Increased r gives decreased € at the pole, producing a more even strain distribution over the bulge...|$|R

Then steel (cold rolled and <b>annealed)</b> and <b>aluminium</b> specimens were tested at two different aspect ratios (R?= 0. 1 and R?=- 1). It was shown that for small stress levels, the heat generated was more or less constant with cycle number. This energy was associated to visco-elastic behaviour (internal friction) and it was shown that the same energy could be measured with the two stress ratios when plotted against strain rate (stress amplitude at constant frequency, here 15 Hz). Then, after a certain stress level, an initial outburst of energy was evidenced over about 10 – 15 cycles before a constant level was reached again. This was associated to micro-plastic adaptation.

40|$|Crystal {{plasticity}} {{finite element}} (CPFE) models are useful tools in modelling the anisotropic stress-strain responses in large deformation of polycrystalline metals. In this study, a CPFE model {{is applied to}} simulate the evolution of crystallographic textures during cold rolling of hot-rolled aluminium plates and during uniaxial tensile, uniaxial compression and simple shear tests of <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium</b> sheets. The performance of the model is critically evaluated through quantitative comparisons of the simulated textures with those predicted by the full constraints (FC) Taylor model and the experimentally measured textures. It is shown that the CPFE model performs better than the FC Taylor model in all the cases. However, {{the quality of the}} texture predictions deteriorates with increasing strain values. The CPFE model gives better texture predictions in the moderately deformed tensile and compression samples (similar to 20 % strain), compared to the more heavily deformed simple shear (0. 85 - 0. 95 shear strain) and cold-rolled (40 - 98 % thickness reduction) samples. It is also shown that the CPFE predictions for cold rolling can be improved with finer discretization, i. e. by assigning multiple elements per grain instead of one element per grain in the finite element model. The improvement is mainly reflected in an improved prediction of the copper component and, in some cases, an improved prediction of the brass component.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} experimental and finite element studies of cold pressure welding of commercial purity aluminium by divergent extrusion. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I gives a general introduction to welding of aluminium alloys focusing on the heat affected zone (HAZ) strength loss following traditional fusion welding, the mechanisms of solid state bonding and {{the most commonly used}} solid state joining techniques for such materials. In Part II the divergent extrusion method, originally designed for simulation of cold pressure welding, has been further developed and explored. As a starting point the combination of advanced process instrumentation and finite element (FE) modelling is used to unravel the underlying material flow and deformation pattern during cold extrusion of commercial purity aluminium. It is shown that the plastic work within the shear deformation zone of the workpiece constitutes about 60 % of the total forming load, the remaining being the result of friction, upsetting and plane strain compression. Because of this shear deformation the divergent extrusion process bears a close resemblance to equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). In Part III the aptness of the divergent extrusion process in simulating cold pressure welding (CPW) is further documented and explored. As a starting point, the situation existing both prior to and after cold bonding is adequately reproduced using finite element (FE) modelling. Combined extrusion and joining experiments are then carried out to unravel the conditions under which cold bonding takes place in commercial purity aluminium. Based on three-point bend testing and fracture surface investigations in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), it is observed that bond initiation occurs gradually {{during the course of the}} extrusion process. Full metallic bonding is achieved when the surface exposure, as determined by the x-component of the strain acting in the extrusion direction, reaches a value of 0. 97. This surface exposure is comparable to that reported for bond formation using conventional CPW and cold roll bonding (CRB) in the presence of oxide and lubricant films at the mating interfaces under similar contact pressure conditions. Finally, Part IV is concerned with cold pressure welding (CPW) of severely plastically deformed (SPD) aluminium. As a starting point, commercially purity aluminium is subjected to single pass equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) and subsequently joined by divergent extrusion (DIE). The mechanical integrity of the spliced components is then documented using notch tensile testing, showing that both the strength and the flow properties of the SPD processed base material are fully maintained across the joint after cold welding. This is because the DIE process implies a mixed deformation mode, i. e. homogenous shear deformation in the bulk and plain strain compression at the joint line where bonding occurs. Moreover, finite element (FE) modelling reveals that the combination of contact pressure to yield strength ratio and surface exposure needed to achieve full metallic bonding is comparable with that reported for bond formation in soft <b>annealed</b> <b>aluminium.</b> This means that SPD processing by ECAP does not alter the conditions under which bonding takes place during CPW, which makes the DIE method particularly useful for joining such materials.

Furthermore we have conducted extensive calculations and analyses to facilitate the successful implementation of a Just-in-time production philosophy, including necessary process improvements and redesigns to be made.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the fatigue cycling of {{crystalline}} materials can lead to detectable changes in the. x-ray diffraction-line profiles. As the full width at half maximum (FWHM) can be more easily derived from the line 13; profile than other parameters such as variance or the Fourier co-efficients. many investigators(1 - 10) have studied the effect of fatigue cycling on the FWHM of the diffraction line. The studies pertaining to the effect of fatigue cycling on Fourier coeffients are limited(8, 11, 12). The results on steel(1 - 8),iron(3), aluminium(9, 10), and silicon, gold and aluminium alloy(9) indicate 13; that the (b/b) versus N curve (where N is number of fatigue cycles, and bo and b are the FWHMs,respectively, for the specimen before and after N cycles) in general shows three distinct stages. Fig. 1 shows this curve for <b>annealed</b> specimen of <b>aluminium</b> when the measurements are made using CuK, radiation, so that diffraction occurs, from the near-surface reqion. 6.
