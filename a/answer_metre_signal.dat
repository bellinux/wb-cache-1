50|$|In {{order to}} confuse the Norwegians Pinguin sailed in the {{opposite}} direction to where the third factory ship was. Once out of sight, she turned and approached the brightly lit vessel in dense fog. Coming in at full speed to within 200 <b>metres,</b> Pinguin <b>signalled</b> warnings and dispatched prize crews. The factory ship Pelagos was captured within minutes. Its several catchers were nearby engaged in their work. Pelagos had 9,500 tons of whale oil and 800 tons of fuel. It had a crew of 210. The captain of Pelagos was instructed to recall his catchers - Star XIV, Star XIX, Star XX, Star XXI, Star XXII, Star XXIII and Star XXIV.|$|R
50|$|Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS is {{the term}} for {{satellite}} navigation systems that provide positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allow small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude) to within a few <b>metres</b> using time <b>signals</b> transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites.

5000|$|AWS {{is part of}} the {{signalling}} system and warns the driver whether the next signal is clear or not. These warnings are usually given 200 yards (180 <b>metres)</b> before the <b>signal,</b> though the distance can vary according to linespeed. Information about the signal aspect is conveyed by electromagnetic induction to the moving train through equipment fixed {{in the middle of the}} track, known as an AWS magnet. [...] The system works by the train detecting sequences and polarities of magnetic fields passing between the track equipment and the train equipment via a receiver under the train.|$|R
30|$|Both leakage and {{compensation}} signals were routed {{to the front}} end of our RFID receiver [27] where they combine in the first directional coupler. This summed signal is then fed through a LNA and a LPF and finally reaches the second directional coupler. Here, a part of the received signal is extracted and fed to the internal power detector and an external power metre. The internal logarithmic power detector output is routed to the testbed controller (TBC) where it is used as a source signal for the tested LCC adjustment routines. Except for the LNA chosen for its highly linear operation, it is not affected by nonlinearity of any receiver hardware component and, therefore, is comparable to detector A discussed in Section 2.6. The external power metre was used to obtain measurement data only, but not for use in the adjustment algorithms. The TBC provides 16 -bit ADCs to capture the power <b>metre</b> output <b>signals</b> and 12 -bit DACs to control the I/Q channels of CCU 1 and CCU 2, corresponding to 4, 096 possible settings for each channel.|$|R
25|$|On the day, {{there were}} three {{sections}} on patrol, a total of 24 men, spread out in a head-high cornfield around the compound. Budd spotted four Taliban approaching, {{at a distance of}} 50 <b>metres.</b> With hand <b>signals,</b> Budd led his section in a flanking manoeuvre round to the cornfield's outskirts to try to cut them off, but they were spotted and the Taliban opened fire on the troops. A further group of Taliban opened up fire from a wall further back. The British soldiers took heavy fire, kneeling or lying down trying to take cover. One soldier received a bullet in the shoulder, and another was shot in the nose.|$|R
50|$|A {{satellite}} navigation or satnav {{system is a}} system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few <b>metres)</b> using time <b>signals</b> transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.|$|R
60|$|All {{national}} literature everywhere {{begins with}} rude songs. From the earliest period {{at which the}} English and Saxon people existed as separate tribes at all, we may {{be sure that they}} possessed battle-songs, like those common to the whole Aryan stock. But among the Teutonic races poetry was not distinguished by either of the peculiarities–rime or metre–which mark off modern verse from prose, so far as its external form is concerned. Our existing English system of versification is not derived from our old native poetry at all; it is a development of the Romance system, adopted by the school of Gower and Chaucer from the French and Italian poets. Its metre, or syllabic arrangement, is an adaptation from the Greek quantitative prosody, handed down through Latin and the neo-Latin dialects; its rime is a Celtic peculiarity borrowed by the Romance nationalities, and handed on through them to modern English literature by the Romance school of the fourteenth century. Our original English versification, on the other hand, was neither rimed nor rhythmic. What <b>answered</b> to <b>metre</b> was a certain irregular swing, produced by a roughly recurrent number of accents in each couplet, without restriction as to the number of feet or syllables. What answered to rime was a regular and marked alliteration, each couplet having a certain key-letter, with which three principal words in the couplet began. In addition to these two poetical devices, Anglo-Saxon verse shows traces of parallelism, similar to that which distinguishes Hebrew poetry. But the alliteration and parallelism do not run quite side by side, the second half of each alliterative couplet being parallel with {{the first half of the}} next couplet. Accordingly, each new sentence begins somewhat clumsily in the middle of the couplet. All these peculiarities are not, however, always to be distinguished in every separate poem.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} system for the stand-o {{detection}} (typically ten metres) of concealed body-worn explosives. The system must be capable of detecting a layer of explosive material hidden under clothing and distinguishing explosives from everyday objects. Millimetre wave radar is suitable for this application. Millimetre Waves are suitable because they are not signi cantly attenuated by atmospheric con- ditions and clothing textiles are practically transparent to this radiation. Detection of explosive layers from a few mm in thickness to a few cm thickness is required. A quasi optical focussing element is required to provide su cient antenna directivity to form a narrow, highly directional beam of millimetre waves, which can be directed and scanned over the person being observed. A system of antennae and focussing optics has been modelled and built using designs from nite element analysis (FEA) software. Using the developed system, represen- tative data sets have been acquired using a Vector Network Analyser (VNA) to act as transmitter and receiver, with the data saved for processing at a later time. A novel data analysis algorithm using Matlab has been developed to carry out Fourier Transforms of the data and then perform pattern matching techniques using arti cial neural networks (ANN's). New ways of aligning and sorting data have been found using cross-correlation to order the data by similar data slices and then sorting the data by amplitude to take the strongest 50 % of data sets. The signi cant contribution to knowledge of this project will be a system which can be eld tested and which will detect a layer of dielectric at a stando distance, typically of ten <b>metres,</b> and <b>signal</b> processing algorithms which can recognise the di erence 17 between the response of threat and non-threat objects. This has partially been achieved by the development of focussing optics to acquire data sets which have then been aligned by cross-correlation, sorted and then used to train a pattern matching technique using neural networks. This technique has shown good results in di erentiating between a person wearing simulated explosives and a person not carrying simulated explosives. Further work for this project includes acquiring more data sets of everyday objects and training the neural network to distinguish between threat objects and non-threat objects. The operational range also needs increasing using either a larger aperture optical element or a similarly sized Cassegrain antenna. The system needs adapting for real time use with the data processing techniques developed in Matlab. The VNA is operated over a band of 14 to 40 GHz, future work includes moving to a stand-alone transmitter and receiver operating at w-band (75 to 110 GHz). ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} future generations {{a fair and}} consistent level of environmental quality is necessary to ensure sustainable development of coastal resources. Adopting a static mode approach towards sea-level rise conflicts with sustaining a dynamic coastal system that responds to perturbations via sediment movement and long-term evolution. In the monitoring of this long-term evolution ancient technologies has played a very important role. Among these the satellite positioning {{is becoming more and}} more relevant. This paper presents a brief survey of the evolution of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) application in coastal processes. The Global Position System (NAVSTAR GPS) is the best known of these satellite navigation systems. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the standard generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and height) to within a few <b>metres</b> using the <b>signals</b> as transmitted by the GNSS satellites. In the same process the receivers also calculate the precise time of the signal reception and as such GNSS receivers can be used as highly accurate clocks. Currently, the United States NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is the only fully operational GNSS. The Russian GLONASS is a GNSS in the process of being restored to full operation. The European Union's Galileo positioning system is a next generation GNSS in the initial deployment phase. China has indicated it may expand its regional Beidou (also called COMPASS) navigation system into a global system. India's IRNSS, is also a next generation GNSS. However, its status and future is unclear as India seems to have entered into a close cooperation with the Russians on the GLONASS system. Satellite Positioning, for this reason, is very popular and its accuracy can support a large number of navigation and timing applications. However, it is generally recognized that these systems lacks the accuracy, integrity, and availability to satisfy the more critical applications. This has led to the development of techniques to augment the basic GPS service. The goal of this paper is to introduce an overview of aforesaid technologies and to present the improvement outcome from their integration (multi constellation) and their augmentation (SBAS – Satellite Based Augmentation Systems) in terms of positioning accuracy, very important in the definition of long-term sediment movement and system integrity...|$|R
