25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E
25|$|At 24 weeks, {{significant}} improvements were found, including <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processing improved, but a decline {{was seen in}} those who remained on benzodiazepines. Further improvements were noted at the 52-week followup, indicating ongoing improvements with benzodiazepine abstinence. Younger people on benzodiazepines also experience cognitive deterioration in visual spatial memory, but are not as vulnerable as the elderly to the cognitive effects. Improved reaction times were noted at 52 weeks in elderly patients free from benzodiazepines. This is an important function in the elderly, especially if they drive a car due to the increased risk of road traffic accidents in benzodiazepine users. At the 24-week followup, 80% of people had successfully withdrawn from benzodiazepines. Part of the success was attributed to the placebo method used {{for part of the}} trial which broke the psychological dependence on benzodiazepines when the elderly patients realised they had completed their gradual reduction several weeks previously, and had only been taking placebo tablets. This helped reassure them they could sleep without their pills.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is a very}} childish and unphilosophical set of impulses {{that has}} led the theologians of nearly every faith to claim {{infinite}} qualities for their deity. One has to remember the poorness of the mental and moral quality of the churchmen of the third, fourth, and fifth centuries who saddled Christendom with its characteristic dogmas, and the extreme poverty and confusion of the circle of ideas within which they thought. Many of these makers of Christianity, like Saint Ambrose of Milan (who had even to be baptised after his election to his bishopric), had been pitchforked into the church from civil life; {{they lived in a}} time of pitiless factions and personal feuds; they had to conduct their disputations amidst the struggles of would-be emperors; court eunuchs and favourites swayed their counsels, and popular rioting clinched their decisions. There was less freedom of discussion then in the Christian world than there is at present (1916) in Belgium, and the whole audience of educated opinion by which a theory could be judged did not equal, either in numbers or <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> the present population of Constantinople. To these conditions we owe the claim that the Christian God is a magic god, very great medicine in battle, [...] "in hoc signo vinces," [...] and the argument so natural to the minds of those days and so absurd to ours, that since he had ALL power, all knowledge, and existed for ever and ever, it was no use whatever to set up any other god against him.

40|$|Abstract — QoS routing {{has been}} shown to be NP-hard. A recent study of its {{hardness}} suggests that the “worst-case ” may not occur in practice and thus there may exist a fast exact algorithm. In this paper, we deploy the idea of iterative deepening search and look ahead to design an exact algorithm for finding the shortest path subject to multiple constraints (the MCSP problem). The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> look-ahead <b>information</b> determines the efficiency of a search algorithm. The higher the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the look-ahead <b>information,</b> the more efficient the search process. An empirical study on a wide range of topologies shows the high <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> look-ahead <b>information</b> in the studied cases. Experimental results also show that our algorithm IDA * MCSP is fast and in general significantly outperforms A*Prune, an algorithm designed for the MCSP problem. The characteristics of iterative deepening search and the high <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> look-ahead <b>information</b> make IDA * MCSP a fast exact algorithm for the MCSP problem. I...|$|R

In implementing FMS cases the U. S. Navy utilizes the same resources and support organizations that are employed to manage and implement U. S. Navy support programs. To reimburse the O&MN appropriated funds used to finance the FMS transactions, a universal language must be utilized to transmit expenditure information to the billing, collecting and accounting activity, the Security Assistance Accounting Center (SAAC). <b>Accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> is critical for the full recoupment of expenditures.
