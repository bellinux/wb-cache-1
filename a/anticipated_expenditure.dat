In 1899 the British Electric Traction Company sought permission for a tramway joining the northern suburbs with the city centre. The system, which operated under the name Peterborough Electric Traction Company, opened in 1903 and was abandoned in favour of motor buses in 1930, when it was merged into the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company. Today, bus services in the city are operated by several companies including Stagecoach (formerly Cambus and Viscount) and Delaine Buses. Despite its large-scale growth, Peterborough has the fastest peak and off-peak travel times for a city of its size in the UK, due to the construction of the parkways.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple Wicksellian macroeconomic model {{that can be}} used in undergraduate macroeconomics courses. It is designed as an alternative to the Romer (2000) model that is slowly replacing IS-LM/AS-AD in many textbooks. The Wicksellian model has four desirable features relative to the Romer model. First, it treats the interest rate as an exogenous monetary policy instrument rather than assuming that the central bank follows a monetary policy rule. Second, the model can be used to derive a monetary policy rule that is consistent with optimizing behavior on the part of the central bank. Third, the model includes a term structure equation. Fourth, the model has a simple recursive structure that makes it easy to work with. The model can be used to analyze a number of interesting issues in monetary policy that are difficult to handle in the IS-LM/AS-AD or Romer model frameworks. These include issues involving permanent versus temporary <b>expenditures</b> shocks, <b>anticipated</b> <b>expenditures</b> shocks, and shocks to the term structure of interest rates.

Materials and methods. A total of 3678 DM 2 patients (with mean HbAc 1 level 9. 3 %) were examined in 23 regionsin the framework of the Diabetes mellitus subprogram of the Federal target program "Prevention and control of socially significant diseases". Two hypothetical therapeutic modalities were considered: treatment with NovoMix 30 and oral hypoglycemic (OHG) agents. The CORE model was used to analyse <b>anticipated</b> <b>expenditures</b> and DM outcomes. Results. Simulation revealed a greater decrease of HbA 1 c levels (- 1. 7 %), reduction of total cholesterol, LDL, systolic AP (- 4. 1 %) and risk of cardiovascular diseases coupled to increase of HDL in patients treated with NovoMix 30. Maximum life expectancy was 17. 2 yr compared with 16. 5 yr in the OHG group and overall cost of the treatment 1, 650, 725 and 1, 586, 234 rubles respectively. Savings for the treatment of diabetes using NovoMix 30 amounted to 19, 832 rubles per patients due to reduced indirect expenditures including management of renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and cerebrovascular complications.

We allow for standard determinants based on Solow’s growth model, as well as financial globalization and trade openness measures for a sample of 56 industrial and emerging market economies over the 1970 - 2004 period. We find that unanticipated government expenditures have negative and significant effects on output growth, with higher effects in developed economies. Along with savings responses, we interpret these results based on how fiscal policy reacts to business cycles. <b>Anticipated</b> government <b>expenditures</b> have negative - but smaller effects - on output growth. These results are very robust to a recursive treatment of expectations, which reinforces the role of new information in an increasingly integrated world economy. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Annual revenues into the Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) from forfeited assets increased from $ 500 million in 2003 to $ 1. 8 billion in 2011, {{in part due to}} an increase in prosecutions of fraud and financial crimes cases. Expenditures in support of forfeiture activities such as equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies and payments to victims also increased over the same 9 -year period, growing from $ 458 million in 2003 to $ 1. 3 billion in 2011. The Department of Justice (DOJ) uses the difference between revenues and expenditures in any year to help cover anticipated expenses in the next fiscal year. Because the AFF uses fund revenues to pay for the expenses associated with forfeiture activities, DOJ carries over funds {{at the end of each}} fiscal year to ensure it has sufficient resources to cover expenses that may not be covered by the next years revenues. When determining the amounts to carry over, DOJ reviews historical data on past program expenditures, analyzes known future expenses such as salaries and contracts, and estimates the costs of any potential new expenditures. However, DOJ has not documented the process for determining the amount of funds needed to cover <b>anticipated</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the next fiscal year in its annual budget justifications. Providing more transparent information as part of the AFFs annual budget process would better inform Congress oversight of the AFF. Further, after DOJ obligates funds needed to cover program expenses, any remaining AFF funds identified at the end of a fiscal year may be declared an excess unobligated balance. DOJ has the authority to use these balances for any of the departments authorized purposes. Per Office of Management and Budget guidance, in recent years, DOJ used these excess unobligated balances to help cover rescissions. Rescissions cancel the availability of DOJs previously enacted budget authority, making the funds involved no longer available for obligation. For example, in fiscal year 2011, DOJ used excess unobligated balances to help cover a $ 495 million AFF program rescission. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that smokers {{are likely to be}} more {{impatient}} and prefer immediate benefits compared with non-smokers. Thus, smokers are regarded as myopic people and therefore have a high time discount rate. Such a tendency is thought to be related not only to short-term benefits (as opposed to long-term benefits), but also free-riding behavior. Using individual data, this paper examines which types of government spending smokers with such characteristics prefer. The important findings are: (1) smokers consider the amount of government spending on social security and unemployment measures to be low and (2) smokers perceive their tax burden to be high. These findings imply that smokers tend to place greater importance on public expenditure that they will personally benefit from, but they are less willing to bear its cost. It is inferred from the estimation results that those who are myopic do not consider long-term benefits, which can result in a number of personal problems in the future, and they <b>anticipate</b> government <b>expenditure</b> will help them with such problems. That is, to enjoy the benefit of free riding, seemingly myopic people are more likely to prefer expenditure on social security and unemployment measures. ...|$|R

Participants were analysed based on their endorsement of Problem Gambling Severity Index criteria (scores 0 – 27), and categorised as non-problem gamblers (score 0), low-risk gamblers (scores 1 – 2), and moderate/problem gamblers (scores 3 +). Specifically, we wanted to identify harm minimisation policies {{that resulted in the}} lowest decreases in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers and the highest decreases in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers. Regarding current policies, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was the ban on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in EGM venues (0. 2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was the reduction in maximum lines (46. 9 %). For the proposed measures, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was visible clocks (1. 2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was reducing cash withdrawals (36. 3 %). These results suggest universal EGM harm minimisation measures can differentially target non-problem and moderate/problem gamblers...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory about}} fiscal {{foresight}} suggests that, {{when it is}} present, the econometric analysis will face substantial challenges; and the shocks received can be nonfundamental if {{the information in the}} model is not sufficient. This thesis introduces fiscal foresight into a conventional vector autoregression (VAR) analysis and examines the dynamic effects of unanticipated and <b>anticipated</b> government <b>expenditure</b> shocks with Finnish data. However, since VAR models base only on present and past information, including a forward looking variable into a VAR may cause issues that lead to misspecifications of the model and into wrong conclusions. To measure government expenditure anticipations I create a news variable by using Bank of Finland’s government expenditure forecast data. The idea is that this variable should capture the effects when the future government <b>expenditure</b> increase is <b>anticipated</b> by the forecasters and assumably by the agents in the economy. By including this news variable in the VARs information set the recovered shocks should describe more accurately the identified shocks in the economy. I show with a simple example and with information sufficiency tests that this news variable overcomes the issues that fiscal foresight may cause to the VAR analysis and that this variable makes the VAR analysis more accurate. I will investigate if including this news variable in a conventional VAR model will change the outcomes on government expenditure, tax revenues, private consumption, private investment and output; first when the unanticipated government expenditure increase causes the shock and second when the positive shock comes from the news that can be interpreted to be an <b>anticipated</b> government <b>expenditure</b> increase. In most cases the literature either supports the Keynesian or neoclassical theory since there exist disagreements on the government expenditure effects on private consumption and investment. These effects are also in the centre of my thesis and the first result is that whether or not the news variable is included to the VAR model the unanticipated government expenditure shock does not crowd out private economic activity. Instead the effects are positive and persistent and they support the Keynesian view. Second result is that when the shock to the system comes from the news, the effects on private economic activity are quite the opposite and they support the neoclassical view. This would mean that if government <b>expenditure</b> increase is <b>anticipated</b> by the agents, they will postpone their consumption and investment decisions until the government expenditure increase is implemented and the expenditure starts to return back to its unshocked path. Results all together suggest that government expenditure increase as an expansionary fiscal policy action is effective if the increase is not anticipated by the agents in the economy. If announcements on future government expenditure increases is done, the hoped expansionary effect after implementation can actually retard the economy for a few years...|$|R

This is similar to the method employed in previous studies in which households were compared using a conventional “OECD-modified equivalence scale” (Girod and de Haan 2010; Chitnis et al. 2014).
