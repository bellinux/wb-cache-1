50|$|Night Owl, a 1993 vampire film shot in New York City's Alphabet City and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Arsenault, starred John Leguizamo and James Raftery as Jake, a brooding vampire/squatter who picks up women in nightclubs and while having sex with them, slices their necks with a matte knife and drinks their blood. One night he murders the sister of Angel, John Leguizamo, who begins a desperate search to find her killer. Ultimately, their paths cross <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> shocking. Meanwhile, Jake {{falls in love with}} Anne Guish, a performance artist, and tries desperately to resist his urge for fresh blood. Featuring Warhol superstar Holly Woodlawn, Caroline Munro of James Bond and Hammer Horror fame, and David Roya from Billy Jack, it was the first in a succession of gritty black and white bloodsucker movies set in the same area of New York City, followed by Nadja and The Addiction. Leguizamo, in one of his first roles, went on to major stardom with films like Moulin Rouge, Carlito's Way and Land of the Dead. Raftery now writes music and performs under the name Rat Wakes Red. Retitled Nite Owl when released on DVD. Not to be confused with a film of the same name starring Jennifer Beals. Interesting note: During the two-year time span of shooting the film, Arsenault directed Leguizamo in his first one-man show, Mambo Mouth, Off-Broadway.|$|E

40|$|O presente trabalho tem como objetivo mostrar como aconselhamento {{pastoral}} e a participação em grupos cristãos podem atuar como mecanismo de fortalecimento da resiliência no contexto familiar, ao mesmo tempo trazer a observação que o aconselhamento eficaz pode exigir do conselheiro, dependendo do caso, um encaminhamento para outro terapeuta, o profissional da psicologia. Nos próprios seminários teológicos existem as aulas de Introdução a Psicologia, onde os alunos aprendem algumas técnicas e conhecimentos como empatia, linguagem corporal entre outras. É bem sabido que os conselheiros pastorais mesmo não sendo explicitamente a favor,usam ferramentas da psicologia nos gabinetes pastorais. O trabalho mostra a fala contraditória de muitos contemporâneos focados na argumentação da Suficiencia das Escrituras, para o aconselhamento chamado noutético. As Sagradas Escrituras realmente são suficientes, a suficiência é nela revelada, o que acontece é que há uma confusão de termos pois a própria escritura fala do trabalho humano, da Graça Comum e de aspectos de bem estar do ser humano que não são salvíficos, pois a salvação eterna é o caso da suficiência da revelação. O aconselhamento pastoral tem o seu alcance assim como o tratamento psicológico profissional o seu, são áreas distintas. Através de pesquisas bibliográficas o trabalho mostra a conectividade de aspectos positivos entre o integracionismo da espiritualidade cristã e a terapia familiar em apoio à resiliência. O que não é alçada do aconselhamento pastoral é do profissional psicólogo, que também tem seus limites em casos psiquiatricos, assim vemos que cada um tem ao seu alcançe e onde acaba o terreno de um começa o do outro. The {{present study}} aims {{to demonstrate how}} pastoral counseling and taking part in Christian groups may act as a mechanism for strengthening the resilience within a familiar context; {{and at the same}} time bring to observation that a eficient counseling may demand from the counselor, depending on the case, a referral to a therapist, who is the professional psychologist. Even in theological seminars there exist classes of Introduction to Psychology, where students learn some techniques and skills such as empathy, body language, among olhers. It is well known that pastoral counselors are not explicitly even though inclined to the use of psychological instrumentation in their offices. This work shows the contradictory discourse of many contemporaries focused on the argumentation of the sufficiency of the scriptures, for the so called nouthetic couseling. The Holy scriptures are really sufficient, this sufficiency is revealed in itself, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> that there is a confusion of terms because the proper Scripture speaks of a human work, Common Grace and aspects of welfare of the human being, which arent for salvation, in salvation is the case of the sufficiency of eternal revelation. Pastoral counseling has its reach as well as a professional psychological treatment has its own, however they are distinct areas. Through literature searches this work shows the connection of positive aspects between the integrationism of Christian spirituality and family therapy in support of resilience. That, which is not achieved at pastoral counseling, comes from the professional psychologist, who also has his/her limits in psychiatric cases. Therefore, each one has his/her scope and where the field of one ends the other starts...|$|E

Know, based on experience with mothers of adolescents, their views and experiences on issues related to gender, sexuality and reproduction, the dialogue between mothers and daughters. 2. Identify the mothersÂ difficulties/ potentialities, with support in their lived experiences. 3. Discover the processes of communication between mothers and daughters, made collectively through dialogue, negotiation and argumentation. 4. Propose the practice of Health Education as a mediator of communication between mothers and daughters in the family context. Methodology: The social agents of the research were seven mothers of female adolescents, participants from non-governmental organization Acartes, residents in the District of Pirambu in Fortaleza-CE. The theoretical framework used was the Theory of Diversity and Universality of the Care of Madeleine Leininger. Data collection followed the model Observation-Participation Reflection, proposed by Leininger; semi-structured interviews and eleven meetings with the group, addressing the stages of development of the daughters: birth, childhood, puberty and adolescence. The project was submitted {{and approved by the}} Ethics Committee of the UFC under Protocol No 17 / 08. Results: social and cultural factors in the community contribute to the vision of sexuality of women and make difficult the dialogue with their daughters. The early pregnancy is a factor in their story of life, and when they project this fact to their daughters, the pregnancy has already occurred, or report that their daughters are likely to become pregnant early. That experience, the fruit of social development, creates barriers, which, alone, women can not overcome, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> the continuation of a cycle in which the relationship of non-dialogue between mother and daughter are reproduced over the generations. In this reality, many times women, placed in a particular cultural background, have little or no degree of motivation of the family or community. When they remember their experiences of adolescence, feelings such as fear and shame are reported in adulthood and relate these feelings as still present in their lives. In relation to dialogue with their daughters, the argument is used by the pregnancy issue, linking it to the future of these barriers in life. For STD, are little discussed as an argument for prevention, not on explaining signs and symptoms, making the vision of adolescents at the preventive issue. The TV is seen as an area that provides the reasoning and negotiation. Conclusions: The study may prompt a renewed vision in the field of sexual and reproductive health in the family, which considers the relational dimension of sexuality, sex and reproduction, aiming to contribute to the promotion of the dialogue between mother and daughter. The intervention of the nurse as part of the team of Health of the Family through the Health Education helps to improve self-esteem and perception of the womenÂs world, encouraging them to a greater degree of autonomy and power to decide about questions related to sexuality. The reflection of the experiences through the memories of the life cycle can encourage them to think about new projects for their lives and shows that even with difficulties, the dialogue between mothers and daughters can occur, whereas it is never too late to learnIntroduÃÃo: A saÃde sexual e reprodutiva Ã fundamental na formaÃÃo de um adulto saudÃvel e, nesta trajetÃria, a famÃlia deve promover a comunicaÃÃo/diÃlogo entre seus integrantes sobre essa temÃtica; no entanto a responsabilidade Ã concentrada na mÃe que, somada Ãs especificidades do ciclo vital, pode desenvolver processos comunicativos fortalecidos ou conturbados. AlÃm das vulnerabilidades sociais vivenciadas pelas mulheres, as estatÃsticas na Ãrea da saÃde evidenciam a crescente feminizaÃÃo do HIV/aids e aumento dos casos de gravidez precoce, sobretudo nas mulheres mais pobres, jovens e com menor acesso a medidas assistenciais e de PromoÃÃo Ã SaÃde. A ambigÃidade das mÃes quanto ao seu papel na orientaÃÃo dos filhos, aliada Ãs caracterÃsticas da adolescÃncia, pode dificultar a comunicaÃÃo efetiva sobre sexo, sexualidade e contracepÃÃo. Objetivo: conhecer, com base na vivÃncia com mÃes de adolescentes, suas opiniÃes e experiÃncias acerca de temas ligados a sexo, sexualidade e reproduÃÃo, dialogados entre mÃes e filhas no contexto familiar. Metodologia: Estudo qualitativo, fundamentado na Teoria da Diversidade e Universalidade do Cuidado, de autoria de Madeleine Leininger. Realizou-se o estudo com um grupo de sete mulheres, moradoras do Bairro Pirambu em Fortaleza-CE. A populaÃÃo foi definida por mÃes com filhas adolescentes; integrantes da ONG ACARTES. A coleta de informaÃÃes seguiu o Modelo O-P-R (ObservaÃÃo-ParticipaÃÃo-ReflexÃo) proposto por Leininger, entrevista semi-estruturada e encontros com o grupo, abordando as fases de desenvolvimento das filhas: nascimento, infÃncia, puberdade e adolescÃncia. O projeto foi submetido e aprovado pelo ComitÃ de Ãtica em Pesquisa da Universidade Federal do CearÃ âUFC, sob protocolo nÂ 17 / 08. Resultados: A faixa etÃria das mÃes variou entre 30 e 46 anos. Ao observar o contexto situacional das informantes, percebe-se que as questÃes ligadas aos fatores sociais e culturais contribuem para a visÃo da sexualidade que as mulheres possuem e dificultam o diÃlogo com suas filhas. Quando recordam as experiÃncias das mÃes na puberdade e adolescÃncia, sentimentos como medo e vergonha sÃo relatados. Sobre a argumentaÃÃo com suas filhas, utilizam o tema gravidez, relacionando a futuras barreiras no desenvolvimento social e profissional destas. Em relaÃÃo Ãs DST, essas sÃo pouco discutidas como argumento de prevenÃÃo, e apontadas numa perspectiva de risco Ã vida, porÃm nÃo esclarecendo muito sobre sinais e sintomas, o que dificulta a visÃo dos adolescentes ante a questÃo preventiva. A TV Ã vista como espaÃo que propicia a argumentaÃÃo e negociaÃÃo. Nas falas, percebe-se a reproduÃÃo das relaÃÃes de gÃnero: para trÃs informantes, as filhas irÃo aprender sobre sexo e sexualidade quando tiverem um companheiro, principalmente por meio do matrimÃnio. Dentre os discursos, a questÃo religiosa foi citada como um meio de influenciar no modo de viver a sexualidade e retardar o inicio da vida sexual. Outro fator Ã relativo Ã falta de motivaÃÃo da famÃlia ou da comunidade. ConclusÃo: Assim, a intervenÃÃo da enfermeira como integrante da equipe de saÃde da famÃlia pode contribuir para a melhoria da auto-estima e percepÃÃo do mundo de mulheres; ou seja, mediante a sistematizaÃÃo de um cuidado sensÃvel Ãs reais necessidades de mÃes e filhas, pode-se fomentar estratÃgias que contribuam para o âempoderamentoâ, incentivando as mulheres a um maior grau de autonomia e poder de decisÃo perante as questÃes sexuais e reprodutivas. Mesmo que muitas vezes todas as vulnerabilidades nÃo possam ser de todo eliminadas e as necessidades superadas na comunidade, as participantes reconhecem a necessidade de aprimorar ou iniciar o diÃlogo junto Ãs filhas adolescentes. Esse sentimento Ã importante, visto que o reconhecimento e a compreensÃo sobre o contexto no qual estÃo inseridas podem nortear e dar mais resolubilidade Ãs aÃÃes de promoÃÃo Ã saÃde neste context...|$|E
