5|$|Birch's tidy {{schedule}} was disrupted in December by Groves, who ordered Oppenheimer to {{give priority to}} the gun-type over implosion, so that the weapon would be ready by 1 July 1945.

5|$|The air pistol {{range is}} the same as the air rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide firing point, and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the firing line <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> line. The current rules require ranges to be built indoors, with specified minimum requirements for artificial lighting. Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Section 9 {{operatives}} {{develop a}} theory that a hacker known as the Puppeteer or 傀儡廻 (Kugutsumawashi, literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was 人形使い Ningyō-zukai, literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when {{they are part of}} a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are one in the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E

5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used {{so that no one}} would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> on 24 July.

The full video was introduced in a TV special, Michael Jackson: The Magic Returns, on Primetime, a CBS television show on August 31, 1987.

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of the prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces {{a picture of his}} daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

30|$|The {{first step}} is to obtain the {{specific}} motion equation of <b>the</b> moving <b>targets</b> after selected. Because of the continuous relative movement of <b>the</b> UAV <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> will constantly change and need to be updated in real time. In order to obtain the motion equation of <b>the</b> moving <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> positions of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are obtained by radar in this paper, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interception, tracking, track calculation, and tracking state determination of <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are completed by radar data processing. In radar data processing, the motion trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is established through correlation and filtering processing, which effectively eliminates false detection caused by residual clutter <b>and</b> updates <b>the</b> <b>target</b> position.|$|R
40|$|Sequential Monte Carlo {{methods have}} {{attracted}} the attention of the tracking community as a solution to Bayesian estimation particularly for nonlinear problems. Several attributes of particle filters support their use in jointly tracking and identifying ground targets in a road-constrained network. First, since <b>the</b> <b>target</b> dynamics are simulated, propagating a target within a constrained state space is handled quite naturally since the particle filter is not restricted to propagating Gaussian PDFs. Furthermore, a particle filter can approximate the PDF of a mixture of continuous random variables (<b>the</b> <b>target</b> kinematic state) <b>and</b> discrete random variables (<b>the</b> <b>target</b> ID) which is necessary for <b>the</b> joint tracking <b>and</b> identification problem. Given HRRGMTI measurements of a target, we propose to jointly estimate a target’s kinematic state and identification by propagating the joint PDF of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> kinematic state (position and velocity) and target ID. In this way, we capitalize on the inherent coupling between <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> feature measurement (<b>the</b> HRR profile) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> kinematic state. In addition to the coupling between a <b>target’s</b> feature measurement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> kinematic state, there exists a coupling between a <b>target’s</b> dynamics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> ID which can also be exploited through particle filtering methods. We develop the particle filtering algorithm for tracking and identifying ground targets in a road-constrained environment and present simulation results for a two-class problem...|$|R
