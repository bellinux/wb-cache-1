25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} model year 1999, an {{increasing}} number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation.|$|E

50|$|The primary factor used in {{determining}} the amount of fuel required by the engine is the amount (by weight) of air that is being taken in by the engine for use in combustion. Modern systems use a mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> to send this information to the engine control unit.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} where a mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF) is used and is located {{upstream}} from the blowoff valve, the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements.

30|$|However, {{most of the}} {{real-time}} <b>airflow</b> <b>sensors</b> {{obtain a}} fixed-point air velocity at designated installation locations. The fixed-point air velocities need to be converted to average volume airflow rates {{to be used in}} ventilation design and ventilation performance evaluations. Traditionally, the determination of air volume flow rate is achieved by using a vane anemometer or smoke tube in conjunction with an area measurement. Conversely, the constraints imposed on the fixed-point sensors are more rigorous because they are capable of measuring the airflow at only one point (Thimons and Kohler 1985).|$|R
50|$|A {{hot wire}} mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> determines {{the mass of}} air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|E
50|$|In many late model automobiles, a mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF sensor) {{is used to}} {{accurately}} determine the mass flowrate of intake air used in the internal combustion engine.

In either case, the vehicle's electronic control unit interprets the sensor signals as a real time indication of an engine's fuel requirement.|$|E

Velocity air meters can be rather restrictive, particularly when engines have been modified for significantly greater airflow than stock (e.g. by fitting turbochargers or superchargers). Velocity air meters have the additional disadvantage that, once the door is fully open, there is no way for the sensor to measure further increases in airflow.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there has}} been a growing demand for flow-temperature sensors for industrial, automotive, {{domestic}} and medical applications. A quick response and low power consumption. Hot Wire Mass <b>Airflow</b> <b>Sensors</b> are used in automotive industry to measure the mass air flow intake into the internal combustion engine according to heat transfer principles. As the heat transfer process is sensitive both to the velocity and temperature of the air, any changes in temperature must be compensated for in order to achieve accurate mass flow measurements. In this paper, the development of a Fuzzy Temperature Compensation Scheme (FTCS) for Hot Wire Mass <b>Airflow</b> (MAF) <b>Sensor</b> is presented. This FTCS used to compensate the measurement error occurred by using Sugeno type FIS for temperature of 60 ¡C- 100 ¡C. In order to verify the performance of the proposed Hot Wire MAF Sensor temperature compensation scheme, first a simulation model is developed using Matlab/Simulink. Then, the algorithm for FTCS has been developed using Programming C Language and been implemented in hardware based real-time using Digital Signal Controllers, (dsPIC). The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy compensation scheme is verified with the estimation error within only ± 1 % over full-scale value...|$|R
50|$|Some {{technicians}} {{will force}} {{the engine to}} run lean by creating a vacuum leak downstream from the mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor,</b> and then watch scanner PIDs for a response. The engine can be forced rich by adding a metered amount of propane to the incoming airflow. In either case, if the sensor does not respond, it likely has a problem. However, these tests do not rule out other circuitry problems or ECM issues. Thorough, systematic diagnosis is recommended.|$|E
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the throttle plate rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a throttle position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the throttle plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the idle position, wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The {{manifold absolute pressure}} sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E

50|$|In a dry nitrous system, extra fuel {{required}} is introduced through the fuel injectors, keeping the manifold dry of fuel. This property {{is what gives}} the dry system its name. Fuel flow can be increased either by increasing the pressure in the fuel injection system, or by modifying the vehicle's computer to increase the time the fuel injectors remain open during the engine cycle. This is typically done by spraying nitrous past the mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAF), which then sends {{a signal to the}} vehicle's computer telling it that it sees colder denser air, and that more fuel is needed. This is typically not an exact method of adding fuel. Once additional fuel has been introduced, it can burn with the extra oxygen provided by the nitrous, providing additional power.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve).

50|$|There {{is still}} some open debate on this issue, but some believe that a problem with short ram air intakes is that the air {{entering}} the intake is at a higher temperature due to {{the proximity of the}} engine, which may reduce some power. This may be partially offset by an increase in the volume of air entering the engine. To counter intake heat problems, many short ram intakes include some form of heat shield. Moving the intake inlet port further away from the engine block will also help to alleviate the problem and some users use a cold air intake where the inlet air is at or close to ambient temperature. However, others claim that Short Ram Intakes (SRIs) or similar Warm Air Intakes (WAIs) offer benefits over Cold Air Intakes (CAIs) which include better MPG due to a more complete burning of fuel. Users with forced induction engines often opt for short ram intakes because compressors adjacent to the engine, especially turbochargers, heat the incoming air and negate much of the benefits of a cold air intake. Additional problems can result from using a short ram intake in cars utilizing a mass <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> though most of today's sensors automatically adjust without issue. Turbulence in the intake airflow produced by the filter or piping, or a change in intake diameter {{at the point where the}} airflow is measured can produce inaccurate airflow readings. The error in airflow then translates to an error in the amount of added fuel. In the worst case, the air/fuel ratio can run lean, causing detonation and possibly engine failure although the <b>airflow</b> <b>sensor</b> will generally detect and correct the throttle to compensate for the warmer air. This can also be solved by modifying/elongating the intake piping, replacing the airflow meter, or by replacing/remapping the engine control computer to provide the correct amount of fuel for the intake airflow at all engine speeds.|$|E
