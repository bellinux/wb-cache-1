In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined <b>as</b> <b>substances</b> that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

40|$|During {{the recent}} decades {{the concept of}} place has been treated with {{intensity}} and frequency in architectural discourse. Much {{has been said about}} such issues as the sense of place, place versus placelessness, the loss of place and so on. This study surveys the concept of place as a theoretical issue of architecture in terms of two themes: place <b>as</b> <b>substance</b> and place <b>as</b> context. In light of these two themes, three further themes, called 'the immediate contextualism', 'towards an urban architecture' and 'spirits of place', are examined. The survey of "the immediate contextualism" starts from a shift from place <b>as</b> <b>substance</b> to place <b>as</b> context in the changing ideals of architecture {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. With the survey of the themes of 'towards an urban architecture' and 'the spirits of place', however, a re-shift from the place as context to place <b>as</b> <b>substance</b> becomes necessary, since what it is about with the first shift from place <b>as</b> <b>substance</b> to place <b>as</b> context on an architectural plane is, in the last analysis, not so much an issue of place as context as an issue of place <b>as</b> <b>substance</b> on an urban plane, namely, our cities. In regard to the changing nature of our cities, the study ends with an argument for open-minded concepts of place to rise to the challenge of new places...|$|R

6000|$|Dante's {{asking if}} they did not long for a higher state of bliss, she and her sister-spirits gently smiled; and then answered, with faces as happy as first love,[3] that they willed only what it pleased God to give them, and {{therefore}} were truly blest. The poet found by this answer, that every place in Heaven was Paradise, though the bliss might be of different degrees. Piccarda then shewed him the spirit at her side, lustrous with all the glory of the region, Costanza, daughter of the king of Sicily, who had been forced out of the cloister to become the wife of the Emperor Henry.

Thus, then, it was easy for me, who have access to all the stores of knowledge, to examine the rolls recording the first coming of my people, the rule of Joseph, the great governor, the coming of his relations here and their settlement in the country. Thus I learned that they worshiped one God, whom they believed to be the only God, in the world. I have been interested deeply in the learning of the priesthood, and have long seen that behind all the forms and mysteries of the Egyptian religion this central idea seemed to be hidden. None with whom I have spoken acknowledged boldly that it was so; but I heard reports that Ameres was bold enough to entertain the idea that there was but one God, and that our far-back ancestors, who had first worshiped him under the various attributes they ascribed to him, came in course of time to lose the truth altogether and to regard shadows <b>as</b> <b>substances.</b> Therefore, I said to myself, I too will believe in the one God worshiped by my forefathers, hoping that in time it may be that I may learn more of him.|$|E

The metal at its height of being seems a mute prophecy of the coming vegetation, into a mimic semblance of which it crystallizes. The blossom and flower, the acme of {{vegetable}} life, divides into correspondent organs with reciprocal functions, and by instinctive motions and approximations seems impatient of that fixture, by which it is differenced in kind from the flower-shaped Psyche that flutters with free wing above it. And wonderfully in the insect realm doth the irritability, the proper seat of instinct, while yet the nascent sensibility is subordinate thereto,--most wonderfully, I say, doth the muscular life in the insect, and the musculo-arterial in the bird, imitate and typically rehearse the adaptive understanding, yea, and the moral affections and charities of man. Let us carry ourselves back, in spirit, to the mysterious week, the teeming work-days of the Creator, as they rose in vision before {{the eye of the}} inspired historian [...] "of the generations of the heaven and earth, in the days that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens." [...] And who that hath watched their ways with an understanding heart, could, as the vision evolving still advanced towards him, contemplate the filial and loyal bee; the home building, wedded, and divorceless swallow; and, above all, the manifoldly intelligent ant tribes, with their commonwealth and confederacies, their warriors and miners, the husband-folk, that fold in their tiny flocks on the honied leaf, and the virgin sisters with the holy instincts of maternal love, detached and in selfless purity, and not say to himself, Behold the shadow of approaching Humanity, the sun rising from behind, in the kindling morn of creation! Thus all lower natures find their highest good in semblances and seekings of that which is higher and better. All things strive to ascend, and ascend in their striving. And shall man alone stoop? Shall his pursuits and desires, the reflections of his inward life, be like the reflected image of a tree {{on the edge of a}} pool, that grows downward, and seeks a mock heaven in the unstable element beneath it, in neighbourhood with the slim water-weeds and oozy bottom-grass that are yet better than itself and more noble, in as far <b>as</b> <b>substances</b> that appear as shadows are preferable to shadows mistaken for substance?
