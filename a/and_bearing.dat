5|$|Lamason's {{leadership}} {{boosted the}} airmen's spirits {{and gave them}} hope while instilling a level of discipline <b>and</b> <b>bearing.</b> One of the first assignments Lamason gave was to mount a guard detail, both day and night, to prevent pilfering by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp. During their incarceration, Lamason insisted the airmen march, parade and act as a military unit.|$|E

5|$|Q-ships were {{merchant}} ships crewed by Navy personnel <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> hidden weaponry. When {{attacked by}} U-boats, {{a portion of}} the ship's crew (referred to as a panic party) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q-ship's guns would become operational and open fire, hopefully destroying the submarine.|$|E
5|$|Tod's {{enthusiasm for}} bardic poetry {{reflected}} {{the works of}} Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society <b>and,</b> <b>bearing</b> in mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history {{on the basis of}} the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone– for example, the polymath James Mill– accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} to Ball, {{along with his}} parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the exterior wall of {{the southwest corner of}} Holy Trinity Church in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> the RFC and RAF motto Per Ardua ad Astra, along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College. A propeller from one of Ball's aircraft and the original cross from his grave in France are displayed at the college's library and chapel, respectively. One of the houses at Nottingham High's Junior School is also named after Ball.|$|E

5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730.

Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the Late Preclassic and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, {{has been linked to}} this tomb, which lies {{deep in the heart of}} the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> a three-pointed royal headband. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.|$|E
5000|$|Dreyer began {{producing}} his own fire-control computer. The {{fundamental difference}} between the systems was that the Dreyer system was a [...] "dual rate" [...] approach that plotted ranges <b>and</b> <b>bearings</b> separately, versus time rather than using a single rangefinder to take both ranges <b>and</b> <b>bearings</b> to drive the drawing of a plan view of own and target ships, as in the Argo system.

5|$|Chauvel began {{training}} his brigade {{upon arrival}} in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on {{high standards of}} dress <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> from his troops. The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General Alexander Godley's New Zealand and Australian Division, along with the 4th Infantry Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. When {{the rest of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties {{in the early days of}} the Gallipoli Campaign, however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to erect a}} further seven high-quality stelae until AD736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> the attributes {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E
5|$|Her {{family had}} been {{relatively}} obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen {{with the consent of}} the great powers to succeed his distant cousin, Frederick VII, to the Danish throne. At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent of Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later in 1863, the same year her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother was appointed to the vacant Greek throne as George I. She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{was killed}} on 9 May 2013, during {{training}} for the 34th America's Cup, when the Swedish Artemis Racing team yacht he was aboard capsized near Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay.

5|$|Telopea truncata, {{commonly}} known as the Tasmanian waratah, is a plant in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to Tasmania where it is found on moist acidic soils at altitudes of 600 to 1200m (2000–4000ft). Telopea truncata is a component of alpine eucalypt forest, rainforest and scrub communities. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to a height of , or occasionally as a small tree to 10m (35ft) high, with red flower heads, known as inflorescences, appearing over the Tasmanian summer (November to February) <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> 10 to 35 individual flowers.
