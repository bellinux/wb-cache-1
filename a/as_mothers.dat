5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, <b>as</b> <b>mothers.</b> Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas are described <b>as</b> <b>mothers,</b> except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme}} of loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> with babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were expected {{to arrive at the}} ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles <b>as</b> <b>mothers.</b> Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan is {{a patriarchal}} society where {{men are the}} primary {{authority}} figures and women are subordinate. Gender {{is one of the}} organizing principles of Pakistani society. Patriarchal values embedded in local traditions, religion and culture predetermine the social value of gender. Islam heavily influences gender roles in particular. An artificial divide between production and reproduction, made by the ideology of sexual division of labor, has placed women in reproductive roles <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> and wives in the private arena of home and men in a productive role as breadwinners in the public arena.|$|E
25|$|However, {{she does}} not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender {{inequality}} in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. She points at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.|$|E

25|$|The {{victims of}} agrarian {{violence}} were frequently Irish land agents, middlemen, and tenants. Merchants and millers were often threatened or attacked if their prices were high. Landlords' agents were threatened, beaten, and assassinated. New tenants on lands secured by evictions also became targets. Local leaders {{were reported to}} have sometimes dressed as women, i.e., <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> begging for food for their children. The leader might approach a storekeeper and demand a donation of flour or groceries. If the storekeeper failed to provide, the Mollies would enter the store and take what they wanted, warning the owner of dire consequences if the incident was reported.|$|E
25|$|While {{cases of}} HIV and AIDS in women have {{stabilized}} internationally, Chile {{has seen a}} rise in HIV/AIDS infection. Societal beliefs about traditional women's roles <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> leads to women being less likely to use contraceptives, increasing the opportunity for disease. Chilean women also often feel subordinate to men due to these traditional belief systems, making women less likely to negotiate {{for the use of}} condoms. In 2007, 28 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in Chile were women. Numbers of women living with HIV is lower than those with AIDS. A study by Vivo Positivo showed that 85 percent of women living with HIV/AIDS reported that they had little to no education or information about HIV/AIDS until diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Although Spartan {{women were}} {{formally}} excluded from {{military and political}} life they enjoyed considerable status <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4thcenturyBC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. Spartan women controlled their own properties, {{as well as the}} properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Girls as well as boys received an education. But despite relatively greater freedom of movement for Spartan women, their role in politics was just as the same as Athenian women.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the lead}} of Frances Power Cobbe, Lind af Hageby {{regarded}} feminism and animal rights (and, in particular, vegetarianism), as strongly linked, seeing the advance of women as essential to civilization, and the tension between women and male scientists as a battle between feminism and machismo. Craig Buettinger writes that feminism and anti-vivisection were strongly linked in the UK, where the comparison between the treatment of woman and animals {{at the hands of}} male scientists (and, indeed, their husbands) dominated the discourse. But in the United States, the antivisectionists based their need to protect animals on their duties <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> and Christians, and did not see advancing women's rights as part of that.|$|E
25|$|Patriarchal {{values are}} deeply {{embedded}} in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed in {{different aspects of the}} society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of patriarchy by women themselves, becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.|$|E

500|$|The first {{priority}} of Raúl Alfonsín was to consolidate democracy, incorporate {{the armed forces}} into their standard role in a civilian government, and prevent further military coups. Alfonsín first tried to reduce {{the political power of}} the military with budget cuts, reductions of military personnel and changing their political tasks. As for the crimes committed during the Dirty War, Alfonsín was willing to respect the command responsibility and accept the [...] "superior orders" [...] defense for the military of lower ranks, as long as the Junta leaders were sentenced under military justice. This project was resisted by human rights organisations such <b>as</b> <b>Mothers</b> of the Plaza de Mayo and public opinion, as it was expected that the defendants would be acquitted or receive low sentences. The military considered that the Dirty War was a legally sanctioned war, and considered the prosecutions to be unjustified. Alfonsín also established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP), composed of several well-known personalities, to document cases of forced disappearances, human rights violations and abduction of children. Alfonsín sent a military code bill to the Congress, so that the military would use it. In its [...] "Nunca más" [...] report (...) , the CONADEP revealed the wide scope of the crimes committed during the Dirty War, and how the Supreme Council of the military had supported the military's actions against the guerrillas.|$|E
