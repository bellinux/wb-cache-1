5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|Fountain pen nibs {{made from}} gold are {{sometimes}} plated with palladium when a silver (rather than gold) <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> desired. Sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades, either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types {{based on their}} <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time however, medieval {{elements}} that were uncovered were reconstructed in what <b>was</b> thought their <b>appearance</b> <b>was.</b> No precise drawings existed of the medieval elements, therefore an approximate reconstruction of their <b>appearance</b> <b>was</b> done.|$|R

5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.|$|E

5|$|The bill's <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} in the interactions of the common blackbird.

5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E

The New Zealand and Australian awards are still made by the jewellers Hancocks from the gunmetal used for the originals. The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular <b>appearance</b> <b>is</b> accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
