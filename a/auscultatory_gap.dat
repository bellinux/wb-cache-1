50|$|An <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> is {{a period}} of diminished or absent Korotkoff sounds during the manual {{measurement}} of blood pressure. The improper interpretation of this gap may lead to blood pressure monitoring errors: namely, an underestimation of systolic blood pressure and/or an overestimation of diastolic blood pressure. In order to correct for an <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> the radial pulse should be monitored by palpation. It is therefore recommended to palpate and auscultate when manually recording a patient's blood pressure. Typically the blood pressure obtained via palpation is around 10 mmHg lower than the pressure obtained via auscultation. In general, the examiner can avoid being confused by an <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> by always inflating a blood pressure cuff to 20-40 mmHg higher than the pressure required to occlude the brachial pulse.|$|E
50|$|In some patients, sounds may {{disappear}} altogether for a {{short time}} between Phase II and III which is referred to as <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Accurate blood {{pressure}} (BP) measurement {{is essential to}} the diagnosis and management of hypertension in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) to help prevent renal and cardiovascular complications. The presence of an <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> during manual BP measurement—the temporary disappearance of the Korotkoff sounds during cuff deflation—leads to a potentially important underestimate of systolic BP if undetected. Objectives. Since the presence of an <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> is frequently associated with increased vascular stiffness, we investigated its presence and correlates in 50 consecutive SSc patients. Methods. For each patient, BP was measured sequentially using three different approaches performed in the same order. Results. Sixteen of 50 patients (32 %) had an <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> which if undetected would have resulted in clinically important underestimates of systolic BP in 4 patients. The presence of an <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> was statistically associated with the presence of antibodies to RNA polymerase III (< 0. 0068) and SSc diagnosis type (< 0. 01). Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that auscultatory gaps are relatively common in SSc and correlate with markers for SSc vasculopathy. If undetected auscultatory gaps may result in clinically important underestimation of BP. Thus, electronic oscillometric BP may be preferred in SSc patients...|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> are related to carotid atherosclerosis and to increased arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients, independent of age. Another cause {{is believed to be}} venous congestion within the limb that is being used for the measurement. Although these observations need to be confirmed prospectively, they suggest that <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> may have prognostic relevance.|$|R
40|$|<b>Auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> are {{a common}} finding in {{clinical}} practice but their clinical and prognostic importance has never been assessed. To examine the relation of <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> to left ventricular and arterial structure and function, wideband external pulse recordings during cuff deflation to detect <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> and ultrasonographic examination of left ventricle and extracranial carotid artery were performed in 168 unmedicated, asymptomatic hypertensive subjects. Vascular stiffness was also evaluated by simultaneous carotid pressure waveforms obtained by applanation tonometry of the contralateral carotid artery. <b>Auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> were present in 21 % {{of the population and}} were associated with older age (64 ± 11 vs 55 ± 13 years, p< 0. 0005). female gender (66 vs 44 %, p< 0. 05) and increased arterial stiffness (beta = 8. 5 ± 4. 6 vs 5. 8 ± 3. 2, P< 0. 005). Differences in arterial stiffness persisted after controlling for the confounding effects of age and gender. The prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques was more than two-fold increased among subjects with gaps (50 vs 22 %, p< 0. 005). No significant differences were found in left ventricular structure and function between the subjects with and without gaps. The two populations had similar systolic and diastolic blood pressures, serum lipid levels and smoking history. Logistic regression analysis including age in the model indicated that only female gender, beta (an index of arterial stiffness) and the presence of plaque were independently related to the presence of <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps.</b> This study provides the first evidence that <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> are related to the presence of carotid atherosclerosis and to increased arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients, independently of age. Although these observations need to be confirmed by prospective studies they suggest a prognostic relevance of the <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps,</b> called Gl, G 2, and G 3, that occur during blood {{pressure}} measurement {{have been identified}} by using wideband external pulse recording. We have previously shown that the wideband external pulse recorded during cuff deflation can be separated into three components (Kl, K 2, and K 3), one of which (K 2) {{is closely related to}} the Korotkoff sound. Gl occurs with cuff pressure just below systolic and is characterized by the presence of Kl and K 2 with intermittent disappearance of K 2. Gl gaps are related to a phasic decrease of arterial (systolic) pressure and were exhibited by 13 of 60 hypertensive patients. G 2 gaps are related to a phasic increase of arterial (diastolic) pressure, occur when cuff pressure is just above diastolic, and are characterized by the presence of Kl, K 2, and K 3 with intermittent disappearance of K 2. Seven of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G 2 gap. G 3 gaps occur with cuff pressure between systolic and diastolic and are characterized by an underdeveloped or blunted K 2 signal. Three of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G 3 gap. The identification of <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gaps</b> in relation to the wideband external pulse provides a qualitative measure of their existence, can be of significant value in better understanding aspects of the auscultatory blood pressure measurement technique, and provides an objectiv...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{quartet of}} vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and respiration) has always played {{a prominent role}} in the diagnostic armamentarium and remains, appropriately, {{at the head of the}} written or verbally presented physical examination. The earliest manifestations of infection, sepsis, occult bleeding, and cardiopulmonary dysfunction often become apparent when looking at the vital signs. In the case of a patient with a high spinal cord injury and autonomic dysreflexia, profound hypertension and bradycardia may be the only clue to a medical or surgical crisis that otherwise remains silent because of interrupted pain pathways. Despite their value, these trusted measurements have always had their pitfalls and limitations. Blood pressure readings can be misleading because of measurement variation and error inherent in improper cuff width, <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap</b> (the silent phases between systolic and diastolic determinations), and even the auditory acuity of the listener,.. ...|$|E
40|$|Discrete wavelet {{analysis}} can efficiently be implemented by filter banks. This paper studies heart sound signals using a wavelet filter banks structure. The heart sound signals are viewed into different wavelet subspaces by expanding them uniquely into sub-band signals of varying time-frequency resolutions. This provides {{the ability to}} isolate and distinguish different vital time-frequency information from the original heart sound signal and to explore the physical characteristics of heart sounds and murmurs such {{as the presence of}} opening snap, third and fourth heart sounds, <b>auscultatory</b> <b>gap,</b> high and low frequency systolic and diastolic murmurs. Very specific important features can be extracted from this information and used as a base for an informative diagnostic tool to classify heart diseases. Preliminary results show the significance of this technique in emphasizing the diagnostic information obtainable from auscultation and in helping to bring cardiac auscultation into prominence again along with more modern technologies such as scans, echo and Doppler scans. These results are believed to be satisfactory and promising...|$|E
