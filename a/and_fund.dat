40|$|Mutual funds {{underwent}} some {{rapid development}} during 2008 - 2011, this was {{indicated by the}} escalation {{of a number of}} NAB and its inclusion units value. However, mutual funds still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> to compare efficiency between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds.</b> There are eighty-nine mutual funds used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock mutual funds, twenty-nine fixed-income mutual funds, twenty-one mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> nine protected mutual funds. This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each mutual funds, the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> 81. 04 percent in mixed mutual funds. Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 201...|$|R

The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a {{spokesperson}} for his race, second only to Booker T. Washington. Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities. Washington was the architect of the Atlanta Compromise, an unwritten deal he struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, disenfranchisement, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> black educational charities.Lewis, pp. 180–181.Logan, Rayford Whittingham (1997), The Betrayal of the Negro, from Rutherford B.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

However, Manchester City Council {{did not have the}} money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.|$|E

5|$|The {{delayed release}} of Odin Sphere led to {{issues with the}} company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire.

Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt.

On 1 April 2010, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that it would initiate action to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the consistent sighting of tigers in the forest area and the tiger reserve declaration would strengthen wildlife conservation efforts, as the sanctuary managers will get more financial support from the central government and the Government of India may also provide support to appoint an additional anti-poaching watchers <b>and</b> <b>fund</b> the establishment of anti-poaching camps.|$|E
