2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> should have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, I think I just got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1993, The Prayer Chain {{released}} {{there first}} collection {{of all new}} material since 1990. The album showed a more aggressive side of the band compared to the upbeat poppier sound of the [...] "Whirlpool" [...] EP. The band proudly distanced themselves from their past, announcing in album opener Crawl that is [...] "Shine is dead", referring to their hit song Shine. The album produced fan favorites Never Enough, Fifty-Eight (written in 5/8 time) and Worm.

The album is about an era of his life that’s been ended. With Fearnet, Hung discusses about how the character within the album became this serial killer. Hung said “he's lost and friendless at that point, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> {{said a lot of}} that comes from my own life, when I've let a lot of people go and went my way alone”, adding to that Hung “used Mannibalector to get out some of those feelings” from his past.|$|E

He has recalled that around that time, [...] "I can remember sitting in my living room and listening to music and the feeling it gave me was incredible… All I knew is that I wanted {{to spend the rest of}} my life trying to give people that feeling.

Brooker also mentioned the selection process for the actress as being disturbing by adding [...] "Presumably someone at To Catch a Predator HQ sat down with a bunch of audition tapes and spooled through it, trying to find a sexy 18-year-old who could pass for 13.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy he said: [...] "The making of this album for me has probably been the most refreshing, mainly because I wasn't trying to record an album, so to speak. I thought I'd take some time off, write some songs for a bit, go and hang in LA for a bit. The album kind of evolved, and I thought, 'You know what, these songs are good'. It's fairly musical. There's nothing really generic about this album, in that when I say generic I mean it's not typically RnB or typically soul or typically pop, it's got different elements from the three. It's quite live, it's got live sounding drums <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, guitars and piano. It's pop songs but the lyrics are a bit deeper. It's an album that I think in moments will make you think." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{questions}} about a possible reunion of the original trio began not long after Peek left the group. When asked {{about the prospects for}} a reunion in the early 1980s, Beckley and Bunnell stated, that they were happy for Peek in that he had found a new life and a new direction, but that it was unlikely there would be a reunion. [...] "All things are possible, like Dan says", Beckley told radio host Lew Irwin in 1982, but [...] "it just doesn't seem in the cards." [...] Within a few years, however, Peek had begun to entertain just such thoughts publicly. [...] "Like they said <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, all things are possible", Peek told interviewer Steve Orchard in 1985. [...] "I really have my fingers crossed. I would love to get back together them and do some things." ...|$|E
5000|$|There was {{an issue}} raised on {{same-sex}} marriages, etc. It is true {{we do not have}} a law allowing same-sex marriages in our country, and that I say again, due to our own traditions and very cultural strong beliefs. Although activities involving same-sex do take place, but they do take place under cover, so to say, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said when I was presenting our report on the ICCPR Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that if one were to exhibit such a behavior in public, one could be, actually be stoned by the public itself. It is a cultural thing. It's not yet acceptable. So the government ... it would be very strange for the government to propose a law towards allowing that; so, it's just that maybe time has not come for us to consider such freedoms in our country.|$|E

We had a really long talk about it and I’m really looking forward to it because I always enjoy working with Hansi and just spending time with him.

5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} review of Hobo with a Grin for his website, George Starostin said: [...] "..."Someones Coming" [...] and [...] "Hot Youth" [...] arent nearly as thrilling, though (even if the strings {{on the former}} are of prime Cockney Rebel quality), and overall, its not like Im saying theres no filler or anything. There is, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, occasionally Steve just rambles so much he forgets about the music (although even this isnt such a terrible crime, seeing as how Harleys lyrics are always intriguing). But its {{just one of those}} albums that is so infused with personality, albeit a shaky, insecure one, you cant really reject it as crap without feeling ashamed. Heres this witty intelligent guy whos obviously trying and often succeeding... and he does {{try to come up with}} interesting musical ideas, not something youd expect from somebody just obsessed with venting out his feelings and thats it." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} based on an {{original}} script by Shane Black who was known for writing Lethal Weapon. He wrote the script after having taken a two-year break from writing, triggered in part by the end of a relationship. Black later recalled:I was busy mourning my life and, in many ways, the loss of my first real love. I didn’t feel much like doing anything except smoking cigarettes and reading paperbacks. All things come around. Time passed and eventually I sat down and transformed some of that bitterness into a character, the central focus of a private eye story which became The Last Boy Scout. Writing that script was a very cathartic experience, one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. I spent so much time alone working on that. Days which I wouldn’t speak. Three, four days where I maybe said a couple words. It was a wonderfully intense time where my focus was better than it’s ever been. And I was rewarded so handsomely ($1.75 million) for that script, if felt like a vindication <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was back on track.|$|E
