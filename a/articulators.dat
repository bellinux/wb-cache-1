Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E

The vertical and horizontal displacements of the maxillae were determined from measurements of the positions of markers on the skull and teeth. Comparison of the magnitudes of the actual and intended movements showed that wafers constructed on the standard <b>articulator</b> had systematic prediction errors of up to 5 mm, but the improved orthognathic <b>articulator</b> showed much smaller random errors.

25|$|Articulation is {{the process}} by which the joint product of the {{vibrator}} and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the <b>articulators</b> result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip ("labial consonants"), the flexible front of the tongue ("coronal consonants"), the middle/back of the tongue ("dorsal consonants"), the root of the tongue together with the epiglottis ("pharyngeal consonants"), and the glottis ("glottal consonants"). These <b>articulators</b> can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called coarticulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} pattern {{within the}} motor map determines the movement pattern of all model <b>articulators</b> (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) for a speech item. In {{order not to}} overload the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the performance of}} the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) improves by either incorporating smoothness constraint directly in the inversion criterion or smoothing (low-pass filtering) estimated <b>articulator</b> tra- jectories in a post-processing step, where smoothing is performed independently of the inversion. As the low-pass filtering is inde- pendent of inversion, the smoothed <b>articulator</b> trajectory samples no longer remain optimal as per the inversion criterion. In this work, we propose a sparse smoothing technique which constrains the smoothed <b>articulator</b> trajectory to be different from the estimated trajectory only at a sparse subset of samples while simultaneously achieving the required degree of smoothness. Inversion experi- ments on the articulatory database show that the sparse smoothing achieves an AAI performance similar to that using low-pass filtering but in sparse smoothing ∼ 15 % (on average) of the samples in the smoothed <b>articulator</b> trajectory remain identical to those in the esti- mated <b>articulator</b> trajectory thereby preserve their AAI optimality as opposed to 0 % in low-pass filtering...|$|R

25|$|The large {{focus on}} the {{possibility}} of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual <b>articulators</b> is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the morphology (internal structure of individual signs).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the proposals of Motor Theory and Direct Realism about the relation between phonological features and articulatory gestures, Kenneth N. Stevens proposed another kind of relation: between phonological features and auditory properties. According to this view, listeners are inspecting the incoming signal for the so-called acoustic landmarks which are particular events in the spectrum carrying information about gestures which produced them. Since these gestures are limited by the capacities of humans' <b>articulators</b> and listeners are sensitive to their auditory correlates, the lack of invariance simply {{does not exist in}} this model. The acoustic properties of the landmarks constitute the basis for establishing the distinctive features. Bundles of them uniquely specify phonetic segments (phonemes, syllables, words).|$|E
25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the <b>articulators</b> affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E
50|$|Generally, in articulatory phonetics, {{the place}} of {{articulation}} (or point of articulation) of a consonant {{is the point of}} contact, where an obstruction occurs in the vocal tract between an active (moving) <b>articulator</b> (typically some part of the tongue) and a passive (stationary) <b>articulator</b> (typically some part of the roof of the mouth).|$|R

25|$|Articulatory-kinematic {{treatments}} {{have the}} strongest {{evidence of their}} use in treating Acquired Apraxia of Speech. These treatments use the facilitation of movement, positioning, timing, and <b>articulators</b> to improve speech production. Sound Production Treatment (SPT) is an articulatory-kinematic treatment that has received more research than many other methods. It combines modeling, repetition, minimal pair contrast, integral stimulation, articulatory placement cueing, and verbal feedback. It was developed to improve the articulation of targeted sounds in the mid-1990s. SPT shows consistent improvement of trained sounds in trained and untrained words. The best results occur with eight to ten exemplars of the targeted sound to promote generalization to untrained exemplars of trained sounds. In addition, maintenance effects are the strongest with 1–2 months post-treatment with sounds that reached high accuracy during treatment. Therefore, the termination of treatment should not be determined by performance criteria, and not {{by the number of}} sessions the client completes, in order to have the greatest long-term effects. While there are many parts of SPT that should receive further investigation, it can be expected that it will improve the production of targeted sounds for speakers with apraxia of Speech.|$|E
25|$|For speech production, the ACT model {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In {{the case of a}} frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs {{at the level of the}} phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. Motoneuron activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently movement patterns of all model <b>articulators</b> (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal.|$|E

Originally {{after two years of}} speech therapy, the patient exhibited speech motor and production problems including problems with phonation, articulation, and resonance.

2500|$|Common {{linguistic}} {{features of}} many sign languages are {{the occurrence of}} classifiers, {{a high degree of}} inflection by means of changes of movement, and a topic-comment syntax. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual <b>articulators,</b> and the signer's face and body. [...] Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions [...] "function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information". It needs to be noted that the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "musilanguage" [...] (or [...] "hmmmmm") {{refers to}} a pre-linguistic system of vocal {{communication}} from which (according to some scholars) both music and language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech <b>articulators.</b> Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, [...] "we're setting off to find honey" [...] might sound qualitatively different from [...] "we're setting off to hunt" [...] or [...] "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that of everyone else, group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.|$|E
2500|$|To {{provide a}} {{theoretical}} {{account of the}} categorical perception data, Liberman and colleagues worked out the motor theory of speech perception, where [...] "the complicated articulatory encoding {{was assumed to be}} decoded in the perception of speech by the same processes that are involved in production" [...] (this is referred to as analysis-by-synthesis). For instance, the English consonant [...] may vary in its acoustic details across different phonetic contexts (see above), yet all 's as perceived by a listener fall within one category (voiced alveolar plosive) and that is because [...] "linguistic representations are abstract, canonical, phonetic segments or the gestures that underlie these segments". When describing units of perception, Liberman later abandoned articulatory movements and proceeded to the neural commands to the <b>articulators</b> and even later to intended articulatory gestures, thus [...] "the neural representation of the utterance that determines the speaker's production is the distal object the listener perceives". The theory is closely related to the modularity hypothesis, which proposes the existence of a special-purpose module, which is supposed to be innate and probably human-specific.|$|E
50|$|Speech organs or <b>articulators,</b> {{produce the}} sounds of language. Organs used for speech include the lips, teeth, {{alveolar}} ridge, hard palate, velum (soft palate), uvula, glottis and {{various parts of the}} tongue. They can be divided into two types: passive <b>articulators</b> and active <b>articulators.</b> Active <b>articulators</b> move relative to passive <b>articulators,</b> which remain still, to produce various speech sounds, in particular manners of articulation. The upper lip, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, soft palate, uvula, and pharynx wall are passive <b>articulators.</b> The most important active articulator is the tongue as it is involved in the production of the majority of sounds. The lower lip is another active articulator. But glottis is not active articulator because it is only a space between vocal folds.|$|E
