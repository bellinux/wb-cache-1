5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E

Many of the leaks were a result of Modern Continental and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This information was not made public; engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Reliant was {{dismantled}} by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned {{for display}} in {{pride of place}} in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005. The tug was then controversially removed and scrapped <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> reduction exercise, with only a single engine and a sectioned representation of one paddle wheel remaining on display (as had been originally intended back in 1969). Further controversy followed as members of the public complained to have been told that the tug, having been visited by many during its nearly 25 years on display, had been put into 'storage' when this was not the case.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> {{reduction}} measure, {{especially in}} high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E

25|$|HPV+OPC is {{not merely}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} HPV-16. Only the expression of viral oncogenes within the tumor cells plus the serum presence of E6 or E7 antibodies is unambiguously conclusive. There is not a standard HPV testing method in head and neck cancers, both in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are commonly used. Both methods have comparable performance for HPV detection, however it is important to use appropriate sensitivity controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of the tissue for p16 is frequently used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> effective surrogate for HPV in OPC, compared to ISH or PCR but there is a small incidence of HPV-negative p16-positive disease accounting for about 5% of HPV-OPC.|$|E

The Duke's first son and successor, João II, raise the House of Braganza to new heights of power, having launched the Portuguese Restoration War and been acclaimed King João IV of Portugal, thus installing the House as the ruling dynasty of Portugal. Teodósio II's second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made Lord of Vila do Conde and became a diplomat, serving at the court of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, but later died a prisoner <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> of the Restoration War.

25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E

25|$|In February 2014, Airbus Helicopters {{announced}} at Heli-Expo 2014 {{the development of}} an improved variant, the EC225e. The EC225e features numerous changes including new avionics systems, such as the TCAS II collision avoidance system, an automatic identification system, and a specialized rig-approach system; it was also intended to feature an improved Turbomeca Makila 2B engine to increase the EC225e's maximum takeoff weight by 550kg, and an additional fuel tank in the rear baggage compartment to extend its range to 300 nautical miles with up to ten passengers on board. Some, but not all, modifications can be retrofitted onto existing EC225s. In the same announcement, in February 2014, Lease Corporation International said that they had placed a $645million order for 15 EC225e (along with 6 Airbus Helicopters EC175) helicopters as the launch customer. In February 2016, the Makila 2B engine was dropped from the EC225e <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> reduction measure, development of the other structural and avionics aspects is proceeding.|$|E
