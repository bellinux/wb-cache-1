Thermal Transfer Ltd subcontracted to S&P Darwell Ltd, which subcontracted to CAT Metalwork Services, which hired young Darren Strang. Darren made ‘a foolish mistake {{on the spur of the}} moment’ by climbing down from a roof, where he was sent by his workmate to get fittings, through a duct. He was meant to use crawling boards and roof purlins. The duct collapsed, hit a sprinkler, and flooded the site. Viasystems sued Thermal, S&P Darwell and CAT Metalwork, while Thermal brought an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>contribution</b> against S&P Darwell and CAT Metalwork.|$|E

40|$|Allocation of {{environmental}} cleanup costs among responsible parties {{is a key}} component of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has expressly acknowledged its importance and twice within the past three terms has grappled with how responsible parties may bring CERCLA claims, <b>for</b> <b>contribution</b> or otherwise, to force other responsible parties to share responsibility for cleanup costs at contaminated sites. While some questions remain to be answered around the edges, it is once again fairly clear that a responsible party who is subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs has a statutory claim under CERCLA by which he can require other responsible parties to bear their equitable shares of the cleanup burden. Thus, because a CERCLA defendant can bring <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>contribution</b> or cost recovery, he may not have to shoulder the entire cleanup burden himself, while other responsible parties avoid liability entirely, just because he had the misfortune of being the one responsible party sued. In addition to providing a whiff of fairness in the Superfund program, the availability of contribution and cost recovery claims by responsible parties is widely credited with promoting settlements and encouraging cleanups of contaminated sites by private parties while preserving governmental resources. The 2 ̆ 2 imminent hazard 2 ̆ 2 provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), like CERCLA, are used to force responsible parties to bear the costs of cleaning up contaminated sites. Sections 7003 and 7002 (a) (1) (B) authorize the United States and citizens, respectively, to require responsible parties to clean up wastes which may present an 2 ̆ 2 imminent and substantial endangerment 2 ̆ 2 to health or the environment. Defendants in RCRA imminent hazard cases, like CERCLA defendants, generally are subject to strict, retroactive and joint and several liability. But unlike in CERCLA cases, virtually without exception courts have ruled that defendants in RCRA imminent hazard cases do not have a claim under RCRA, <b>for</b> <b>contribution</b> or otherwise, by which they can seek to force other responsible parties to share the cleanup responsibility...|$|R

40|$|Background: At a time {{of growing}} {{emphasis}} on both the use of research and accountability, {{it is important for}} research funders, researchers and other stakeholders to monitor and evaluate the extent to which research contributes to better <b>action</b> <b>for</b> health, and find ways to enhance the likelihood that beneficial contributions are realized. Past attempts to assess research 'impact' struggle with operationalizing 'impact', identifying the users of research and attributing impact to research projects as source. In this article we describe Contribution Mapping, a novel approach to research monitoring and evaluation that aims to assess contributions instead of impacts. The approach focuses on processes and actors and systematically assesses anticipatory efforts that aim to enhance contributions, so-called alignment efforts. The approach is designed to be useful for both accountability purposes and for assisting in better employing research to contribute to better <b>action</b> <b>for</b> health. Methods: <b>Contribution</b> Mapping is inspired by a perspective from social studies of science on how research and knowledge utilization processes evolve. For each research project that is assessed, a three-phase process map is developed that includes the main actors, activities and alignment efforts during research formulation, production and knowledge extension (e. g. dissemination and utilization). The approach focuses on the actors involved in, or interacting with, a research project (the linked actors) and the most likely influential users, who are referred to as potential key users. In the first stage, the investigators of the assessed project are interviewed to develop a preliminary version of the process map and first estimation of research-related contributions. In the second stage, potential key-users and other informants are interviewed to trace, explore and triangulate possible contributions. In the third stage, the presence and role of alignment efforts is analyzed and the preliminary results are shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback and validation. After inconsistencies are clarified or described, the results are shared with stakeholders for learning, improvement and accountability purposes.

The research method is integrated and consists of <b>action</b> research <b>for</b> coach <b>contribution</b> by training and evaluation, and theoretical-argumentative to deduce a framework in which define the data processing. Eleven well-trained competitive athletes were recruited and asked to swim 5 x 20 -m, one time with ball, and one time without ball. This test was repeated three times. For each swimmer was calculated the mean and standard error of times per test, both with and without the ball. Analysis was conducted individually for each athlete, and in total for each test. The results, trough confrontation of means of times, reveals a high variability, and indicate a non mechanical incidence of ball handling on swimming intensity. Reading this results in correlation to athletes anamnesis reveals that incidence of ball-handling is significant only in athletes who have a swimming-oriented athletic history, but there are not significant differences in times for athletes who have a water polo oriented athletic history. The results show as this study can help the coach to train the team for improving the analyzed skills in different mode, creating a methodological system training to enhance the performance. Coaches are suggested to carefully monitor swimming rhythm during trials, and to increment ball-handling in every training condition...|$|R
