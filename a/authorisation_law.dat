40|$|Native title {{involves}} an interface between the Australian legal system and Indigenous legal, {{cultural and political}} systems. The assertion and management of native title rights involves collective action by sometimes large and disparate groups of Indigenous people. Contentious politics makes such collective action difficult and the courts will often be asked to decide whether group decisions have been validly made. In {{the last two decades}} a vast and complex body of law and practice has developed to address this challenge. <b>Authorisation</b> <b>law</b> is a set of principles about how the views and intentions of native title claimants or holders are translated into legally effective decisions. This book sets out the legal rules and their application in various situations: native title claims, native title agreement-making, decision-making by native title corporations, and compensation applications. It also addresses key practical, ethical and political dimensions of native title decision-making. This book will be useful for native title practitioners including lawyers, judges and native title holders. It will also be relevant to academic research into the ethical, political and anthropological dimensions of Indigenous governance...|$|E

50|$|Until {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, {{commercial}} banks {{were able to}} issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation. Many consider {{the origins of the}} central bank to lie {{with the passage of the}} Bank Charter Act of 1844. Under this <b>law,</b> <b>authorisation</b> to issue new banknotes was restricted to the Bank of England. At the same time, the Bank of England was restricted to issue new banknotes only if they were 100% backed by gold or up to £14 million in government debt. The Act served to restrict the supply of new notes reaching circulation, and gave the Bank of England an effective monopoly on the printing of new notes.|$|R
40|$|This chapter uses a {{negligence}} law framework {{to consider the}} liability of online intermediaries, such as ISPs, for copyright infringement by their users. It examines negligence cases which ask whether a defendant {{has a duty to}} act to stop a third party from harming a plaintiff, and argues that these cases provide a more coherent conception of “control” than the notion of “power to prevent” that currently exists in copyright <b>authorisation</b> case <b>law.</b> This chapter argues that “power to prevent” in sections 36 (1 A) (a) and 101 (1 A) (a) of the Copyright Act 1968 is too easily established, particularly when conflated with an assessment of “reasonable steps” in paragraph (c) of those sections. This chapter proposes that an intermediary’s power to prevent infringement must be a real and actual power over the infringing user and that this power is relevant to whether the intermediary has a duty to act to prevent infringement. By contrast, reasonable steps taken to prevent infringement are not relevant until after a duty is established. The judgment of Justices Gummow and Hayne in the High Court decision of Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited [2012] is used to demonstrate these claims...|$|R
500|$|In 1869, {{the time}} {{allowed by the}} 1864 Act to build the bridge expired. Delays caused by the Chelsea Embankment project meant that work on the bridge had not even begun, and a new Act of Parliament was {{required}} to extend the time limit. Construction finally got underway in 1870, and it was anticipated that the bridge would be completed in about a year, {{at a cost of}} £70,000 (about £ in [...] ). In the event, the project ran for over three years, and the final bill came to £200,000 (about £ in [...] ). It was intended to open the bridge and the Chelsea Embankment in a joint ceremony in 1874, but the Albert Bridge Company was keen to start recouping the substantially higher than expected costs, and the bridge opened without any formal ceremony on 23 August 1873, almost ten years after its <b>authorisation.</b> As the <b>law</b> demanded, the Albert Bridge Company then bought Battersea Bridge.|$|R

Noorani notes [...] {{that the}} {{doctrine}} has [...] "now spread {{far and wide}} beyond its frontiers.", but that the eventual attribution to Dietrich Conrad is absent, who propounded the arguments in a lecture to the law faculty in the Banaras Hindu University. The argument, Noorani narrates made way to M K Nambyar who read the excerpt out in Golaknath. [...] "Perhaps {{the position of the}} Supreme Court is influenced {{by the fact that it}} has not so far been confronted with any extreme type of constitutional amendments. It is the duty of the jurist, though, to anticipate extreme cases of conflict, and sometimes only extreme tests reveal the true nature of a legal concept. So, if for the purpose of legal discussion, I may propose some fictive amendment laws to you, could it still be considered a valid exercise of the amendment power conferred by Article 368 if a two-thirds majority changed Article 1 by dividing India into two States of Tamilnad and Hindustan proper?"Could a constitutional amendment abolish Article 21, to the effect that forthwith a person could be deprived of his life or personal liberty without <b>authorisation</b> by <b>law?</b> Could the ruling party, if it sees its majority shrinking, amend Article 368 to the effect that the amending power rests with the President acting on the advice of the Prime Minister? Could the amending power be used to abolish the Constitution and reintroduce, let us say, the rule of a moghul emperor or of the Crown of England? I do not want, by posing such questions, to provoke easy answers. But I should like to acquaint you with the discussion which took place on such questions among constitutional lawyers in Germany in the Weimar period - discussion, seeming academic at first, but suddenly illustrated by history in a drastic and terrible manner."

40|$|Management of {{information}} related to the real properties is a key topic both in private and public sector. In the Italian context, can be spotted an overall lack of organisation of the information concerning the real estate assets, from the building scale, to the neighbourhood, until {{the city and the}} territory. Moreover, management of the urban environment is characterised by the presence of different players asking for common needs in management and use of data. This research aims at proposing the Building Logbook and the District Logbook as tools for collection, organisation and management {{of information}}, in a perspective of streamlined real estate management process. Moreover, the Logbooks can be conceived as tools for risk management. They should be exploited especially in technical management phase of assets, {{as well as in the}} verification of compliance with <b>laws,</b> <b>authorisations</b> and licenses, since these issues often bear to disputes between public and private players. Often disputes concern that areas where the competences and responsibilities among different players are not clear (connections to system, property boundaries, licenses, occupation of public land etc.). In this situations, information management assumes a key role, since it could be a powerful mean to clarify responsibilities among players. Therefore, the scope of the research concerns the investigation on the relationships and related information flows among stakeholders in the real estate field. Altogether, it can be stated that the logbooks can streamline processes in the use phase of assets, despite they could be intended as rigid control tools. Through this paper these issues will deepened and clarified. The paper concludes with some considerations concerning the possible integration of the Logbooks in a digital environment, following the BIM approach...|$|R
5000|$|Henry Thornton, a {{merchant}} banker and monetary theorist {{has been described}} as the father of the modern central bank. An opponent of the real bills doctrine, he was a defender of the bullionist position and a significant figure in monetary theory, his process of monetary expansion anticipating the theories of Knut Wicksell regarding the [...] "cumulative process which restates the Quantity Theory in a theoretically coherent form". As a response 1797 currency crisis, Thornton wrote in 1802 An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, in which he argued that the increase in paper credit did not cause the crisis. The book also gives a detailed account of the British monetary system as well as a detailed examination {{of the ways in which}} the Bank of England should act to counteract fluctuations in the value of the pound.Until the mid-nineteenth century, commercial banks were able to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.

The Bank accepted the role of 'lender of last resort' in the 1870s after criticism of its lacklustre response to the Overend-Gurney crisis. The journalist Walter Bagehot wrote an influential work on the subject Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, in which he advocated for the Bank to officially become a lender of last resort during a credit crunch (sometimes referred to as [...] "Bagehot's dictum").|$|R
