40|$|Foreign minors {{often have}} {{problems}} integrating into Italian society. The two principal {{reasons for this}} is their young age, and their different cultural background. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide data regarding the treatment of foreign juveniles in the Italian justice system. The authors believe that it is important to create secondary and tertiary prevention services in order to decrease the likelihood of recidivism, and to promote the minor’s integration into the social fabric of their adopted country. The principal motive for which minors leave their homeland is the search for <b>a</b> new way <b>of</b> life. Persichella wrote <b>of</b> “advance socialization”, <b>a</b> term that refers to the expectations of well being that a foreigner might associate with a particular place. These mental images are often generated by the mass media, as well as by relatives and friends who have already emigrated there. These youngsters are often disappointed upon their arrival in the new country, leaving them in <b>a</b> state <b>of</b> relative deprivation, frustration, and tension, which are significant risk factors for the commission of crimes. The percentage of foreigners convicted of crimes in Italy has increased over the last decade with respect to the number of convicted Italians. This is true for all crime categories. There are many reasons for this phenomenon. Among them are the conditions in which these immigrants find themselves when they arrive in Italy (e. g. how their previous expectations measure up to the reality of their new existence; how successfully they reintegrate with their families; their ability to enter into the work force; and the influence of both Italian and foreign organized crime groups). Foreign minors are more frequently placed in jail than their Italian counterparts. This is because it is less likely that they would have access to resources that might allow them to be spared detention (e. g. having a nuclear family; a home; steady employment, etc.) In theory, these foreign juveniles are supposed to have access to detention alternatives, but in reality they must overcome serious obstacles in order to take advantage of them. Cultural mediation acts to facilitate relationships between individuals from ethnic minority groups and the associated social services that are in place to serve them. The cultural mediator aids the foreigner in understanding how to behave appropriately, and attempts to sensitize him to the customs and way of life in Italy. The cultural mediator also actively participates at various phases of institutional life, for example, in helping the minor to communicate with juvenile justice officials, and with relatives. In addition, the mediator also aids the family in navigating the Italian legal system. Some juvenile detention centers (IPMs) report <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> resources and funding necessary to create appropriate treatment plans. They cite, for example, the under utilization of cultural mediators who are often marginalized and relegated to the singular role of interpreter. Cultural mediators are typically only available on an hourly basis, and are not considered to be <b>an</b> integral part <b>of</b> the treatment team. Short stays in IPMs are also reported to be problematic: repeated transfers make it impossible for staff to get to know the minor in order to create an individualized education program. When considering the usefulness of detention alternatives, the study and development of shareable management models that address the real needs of minors in the juvenile justice system are of fundamental importance. Facilitating the social integration process, <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>guardian</b> when necessary, and providing qualified legal representation are high on the list of priorities. Only through the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> united partnership can a welcoming network be created: one that is able to pick up on the first signs of trouble that often confront foreign minors...|$|R

5000|$|California {{state courts}} {{strictly}} follow the common-law {{definition of the}} writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct errors of fact. The writ may not be issued to correct errors of law. The Supreme Court of California provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in California (Citations and quotes removed): [...] The writ of coram nobis is a non-statutory, common law remedy whose origins trace back to an era in England in which appeals and new trial motions were unknown. Far from being of constitutional origin, the proceeding designated [...] "coram nobis" [...] was contrived by the courts at an early epoch {{in the growth of}} common law procedure to provide a corrective remedy because of the absence at that time of the right to move for a new trial and the right of appeal from the judgment. The grounds on which a litigant may obtain relief via a writ of coram nobis are narrower than on habeas corpus. The writ's purpose is to secure relief, where no other remedy exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court had known it and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not then known to the court.The principal office of the writ of coram nobis was to enable the same court which had rendered the judgment to reconsider it in a case in which the record still remained before that court. The most comprehensive statement of the office and function of this writ which has come to our notice is the following: The office of the writ of coram nobis is to bring the attention of the court to, and obtain relief from, errors of fact, such as the death of either party pending the suit and before judgment therein; or infancy, where the party was not properly represented by guardian, or coverture, where the common-law disability still exists, or insanity, it seems, {{at the time of the}} trial; or a valid defense existing in the facts of the case, but which, without negligence on the part of the defendant, was not made, either through duress or fraud or excusable mistake; these facts not appearing on the face of the record, and being such as, if known in season, would have prevented the rendition and entry of the judgment questioned.The writ of coram nobis does not lie to correct any error in the judgment of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this could be, there would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.With the advent of statutory new trial motions, the availability of direct appeal, and the expansion of the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis had, by the 1930's, become a remedy practically obsolete except in the most rare of instances and applicable to only a very limited class of cases. The statutory motion for new trial has, for most purposes, superseded the common law remedy; and, until recent years, coram nobis was virtually obsolete in California.The seminal case setting forth the modern requirements for obtaining a writ of coram nobis is People v. Shipman which stated the writ of coram nobis may be granted only when three requirements are met:# The petitioner must show that some fact exists which, without any fault or negligence on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of the judgment.# The petitioner must show that the newly discovered evidence does not go to the merits of issues tried; issues of fact, once adjudicated, even though incorrectly, cannot be reopened except on motion for new trial. This second requirement applies even though the evidence in question is not discovered until after the time for moving for a new trial has elapsed or the motion has been denied.# The petitioner must show that the facts upon which he relies were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time of his motion for the writ.Several aspects of the test set forth in Shipman illustrate the narrowness of the remedy. Because the writ of coram nobis applies where a fact unknown to the parties and the court existed at the time of judgment that, if known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment, the remedy does not lie to enable the court to correct errors of law. Moreover, the allegedly new fact must have been unknown and must have been in existence at the time of the judgment.For a newly discovered fact to qualify as the basis for the writ of coram nobis, courts look to the fact itself and not its legal effect. It has often been held that the motion or writ is not available where a defendant voluntarily and with knowledge of the facts pleaded guilty or admitted alleged prior convictions because of ignorance or mistake as to the legal effect of those facts.Finally, the writ of coram nobis is unavailable when a litigant has some other remedy at law. A writ of coram nobis is not available where the defendant had a remedy by (a) appeal or (b) motion for a new trial and failed to avail himself of such remedies. The writ of coram nobis is not a catch-all by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. In the vast majority of cases a trial followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. The writ of coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. It will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. But it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not available.The writ was issued by state courts in California in these types of situations: :*Where the defendant was insane at the time of trial and this fact was unknown to court and counsel.:*Where defendant was an infant and appeared by attorney without the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guardian</b> or guardian ad litem.:*Where the defendant was a feme covert and her husband was not joined.:*Where the defendant was a slave and was tried and sentenced as a free man.:*Where the defendant was dead at the time judgment was rendered.:*Where default was entered against a defendant who had not been served with summons and who had no notice of the proceeding.:*Where counsel inadvertently entered an unauthorized appearance in behalf of a defendant who had not been served with process.:*Where a plea of guilty was procured by extrinsic fraud.:*Where a plea of guilty was extorted through fear of mob violence.:*Where defendants and their counsel were induced by false representations to remain away from the trial under circumstances amounting to extrinsic fraud.By contrast, the writ of coram nobis was found unavailable by state courts in California in the following situations: :*Where trial counsel improperly induced the defendant to plead guilty to render him eligible for diversion and the trial court eventually denied diversion.:*Where the defendant pleaded guilty to having a prior felony conviction when he was eligible to have the prior reduced to a misdemeanor.:*Where the defendant discovered new facts that would have bolstered the defense already presented at trial. The court concluded that although the new facts would have been material and possibly beneficial to the defendant at trial, they would not have precluded entry of the judgment.:*Where the defendant mistakenly believed his plea to second degree murder meant he would serve no more than 15 years in prison.:*Where the defendant claimed neither his attorney nor the court had advised him before he pleaded that his convictions would render him eligible for civil commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA).:*Where the defendant challenged the legality of his arrest, the identity of the informant, and the failure of the court to make findings on the prior convictions.
