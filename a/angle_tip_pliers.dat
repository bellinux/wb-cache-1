40|$|The {{accurate}} in situ, non-contact {{measurement of the}} temperature distribution within diesel after-treatment filters requires the employment of optical fibres with special tip geometry. The goniometric characteristics of optical fibres with flat, 45 ° angled and bent and polished tips are studied such that the specific radiation acceptance region can be determined. One 2 mm diameter fused silica and two 0. 425 mm diameter sapphire optical fibres are examined. Detailed discussion of the relative intensity profiles observed for these fibres is presented. Of the three fibres evaluated, the 45 ° <b>angled</b> <b>tip</b> geometry provides the most precise response for measuring radiation emitted from the internal filter walls. Exploiting the characteristics of total internal reflection, the 45 ° <b>angled</b> <b>tip</b> fibre accepts the maximum quantity of incident radiation at an angle perpendicular to the optical axis...|$|R

50|$|Given {{a desired}} {{magnetization}} profile, determining the RF pulse that produces {{it is generally}} nonlinear, due to the non-linearity of the Bloch equations. At low <b>tip</b> <b>angles,</b> the RF excitation waveform can be approximated by the inverse Fourier Transform of the desired frequency profile, using the excitation kspace analysis. The small <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> approximation continues to hold well for <b>tip</b> <b>angles</b> {{on the order of}} 90 degree.

40|$|In modern wind farms, {{maximum power}} point {{tracking}} (MPPT) is widely implemented. Using the MPPT method, each individual wind turbine is controlled by its pitch <b>angle</b> and <b>tip</b> speed ratio to generate the maximum active power. In a wind farm, the upstream wind turbine may cause power loss to its downstream wind turbines due to the wake effect. According to the wake model, downstream power loss is also determined by the pitch <b>angle</b> and <b>tip</b> speed ratio of the upstream wind turbine. By optimizing the pitch <b>angle</b> and <b>tip</b> speed ratio of each wind turbine, the total active power of the wind farm can be increased. In this paper, the optimal pitch <b>angle</b> and <b>tip</b> speed ratio are selected for each wind turbine by the exhausted search. Considering the estimation error of the wake model, a solution to implement the optimized pitch <b>angle</b> and <b>tip</b> speed ratio is proposed, which is to generate the optimal control curves for each individual wind turbine off-line. In typical wind farms with regular layout, based on the detailed analysis of the influence of pitch <b>angle</b> and <b>tip</b> speed ratio on the total active power of the wind farm by the exhausted search, the optimization is simplified with the reduced computation complexity. By using the optimized control curves, the annual energy production (AEP) is increased by 1. 03 % compared to using the MPPT method in a case-study of a typical eighty-turbine wind farm...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{interaction}} in the rotating bucket of a pelton turbine influences the system power output.

50|$|Hanriot {{followed}} their successful HD.3 two-seat fighter with another of that kind, the bigger, heavier {{and more powerful}} HD.5. This was an equal span two bay biplane, the bays defined by two pairs of parallel interplane struts on each side, assisted by wire bracing. The wings were almost rectangular in planform, though with slightly <b>angled</b> <b>tips,</b> mounted without stagger. The interplane gap was unusually small, with the upper wing {{so close to the}} fuselage that its leading edge required a deep, slot-like cutout for the pilot's head. Behind him the trailing edge also had a cutout, this for the movement of the rear gunner's Lewis gun(s). The HD.5 had short span, horn balanced ailerons. Its tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, had a straight leading edge, <b>angled</b> <b>tips</b> and carried slightly tapered, horn-balanced elevators with a cutout for rudder movement. The fin was small but the rudder was broad chord and low; it was very rounded and extended down to the keel.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{different}} <b>tip</b> <b>angles</b> (30 °, 60 °, 90 ° and 120 °) on the arc and weld pool behaviour is analysed in 2 mm and 5 mm arc lengths with tilted (70 °) torch. Arc temperature, velocity, current density, heat flux and gas shear are investigated in the arc region and pool convection and puddle shapes are studied in the weld pool region. The arc temperature at the tungsten electrode is found the maximum with sharp tip and decreases as the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> increases. The arc temperature on the anode (workpiece) surface becomes concentrated with increase in <b>tip</b> <b>angle.</b> The arc velocity and gas shear stress are observed large with sharp tip and decreasing as the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> increases. Current density on the anode surface does not change with <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> and observed almost the same in all the <b>tip</b> <b>angles</b> in both 2 mm and 5 mm arc lengths. Heat flux due to conduction and convection is observed {{more sensitive to the}} <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> and decreases as the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> increases. The electromagnetic force is slightly observed increasing and the buoyancy force is observed slightly decreasing with increase in <b>tip</b> <b>angle.</b> Analysing each driving force in the weld pool individually shows that the gas drag and Marangoni forces are much stronger than the electromagnetic and buoyancy forces. The weld pool shape is observed wide and shallow in sharp and narrow and deep in large <b>tip</b> <b>angle.</b> Increasing the arc length does not change the weld pool width; however, the weld pool depth significantly changes with arc length and is observed deep in short arc length. The arc properties and weld pool shapes are observed wide ahead of the electrode tip in the weld direction due to 70 ° torch angle. Good agreement is observed between the numerical and experimental weld pool shapes...|$|R

50|$|The basic {{geometry}} of a countersink (cutter) inherently {{can be applied}} to the plunging applications described above (axial feed only) and also to other milling applications (sideways traversal). Therefore, countersinks overlap in form, function, and sometimes name with chamfering endmills (endmills with <b>angled</b> <b>tips).</b> Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).|$|R
50|$|The Grüne Post had a near {{rectangular}} horizontal tail {{of constant}} chord and slightly <b>angled</b> <b>tips.</b> A straight tapered, narrow fin was placed far enough aft that the rudder hinge line was almost beyond the elevator trailing edge; the rudder was also straight tapered, square tipped and {{reached down to}} the keel.
