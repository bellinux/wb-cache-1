This paper demonstrates that in the insurance market there do exist contracts in which optimality is accompanied by a violation <b>of</b> the <b>indemnity</b> principle if the insurer and insured have deviant beliefs in loss distribution.

5000|$|The Divine Principle goes on {{to explain}} three types <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{conditions}}. Equal conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse [...] "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example <b>of</b> an equal <b>indemnity</b> condition. Lesser conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> lesser <b>indemnity</b> conditions. Greater conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid {{to make up for}} the earlier failure. Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-18) and the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> greater <b>indemnity</b> conditions. The Divine Principle then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a [...] "just and righteous" [...] God to work through mankind. Jesus' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity's history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The Divine Principle then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.|$|R

Investigation is devoted to effects of different approaches on improving performance of RA to compensate the lower quality of RA. The pre-soaking treatment approach reduces the old cement mortar and removes the weaker link in interfacial zone. Moreover, The two-stage mixing approach (TSMA) is adopted, leads to the formation of a thin layer of cement slurry {{on the surface of}} RA which permeates into the porous old cement mortar, filling up the old cracks and voids for increasing compressive strength.

40|$|International audiencePrPSc accumulates in prion-affected {{individuals}} in the form <b>of</b> amorphous <b>aggregates.</b> <b>Limited</b> proteolysis <b>of</b> PrPSc results in a protease-resistant core of PrPSc of molecular mass of 27 - 30 kDa (PrP 27 - 30). Aggregated forms of PrP co-purify with prion infectivity, although infectivity does not always correlate {{with the presence of}} PrP 27 - 30. This suggests that discrimination between PrPC and PrPSc by proteolysis may underestimate the repertoire and quantity of PrPSc subtypes. We have developed a conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI) utilizing time-resolved fluorescence to study the conformers of disease-associated PrP in natural cases of sheep scrapie, without using Proteinase K-treatment to discriminate between PrPC and PrPSc. The capture-detector CDI utilizes N-terminal- and C-terminal-specific anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies that recognize regions of the prion protein differentially buried or exposed depending upon the extent of denaturation of the molecule. PrPSc was precipitated from scrapie-infected brain stem and cerebellum tissue following sarkosyl extraction, with or without the use of sodium phosphotungstic acid, and native and denatured PrPSc detected by CDI. PrPSc was detectable in brain tissue from homozygous VRQ and ARQ scrapie-infected sheep brains. The highest levels of PrPSc were found in homozygous VRQ scrapie-infected brains. The quantity of PrPSc was significantly reduced, up to 90 % in some cases, when samples were treated with Proteinase K prior to the CDI. Collectively, our data show that the level of PrPSc in brain samples from cases of natural scrapie display genotypic differences and that a significant amount of this material is Proteinase K-sensitive...|$|R
