40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the link between anxiety and allergies to establish whether it reflects a psychobiological reality or a possible methodological bias. A cohort of 1, 037 children enrolled in the study. Anxiety disorders were assessed between 11 and 21 years. <b>Anxious</b> <b>personality</b> was assessed at 18 years. Allergies were examined at 21 years by (a) self reports, (b) skin pricks, and (c) serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE). Self-reported allergies were predicted by recurrent anxiety disorders (OR [95 % CI] = 51. 56 [1. 06 – 2. 30], p = 5. 023) and self-reports of <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> (OR [95 % CI] = 51. 67 [1. 17 – 2. 37], p =. 004) : Objectively verified allergies were not.

40|$|Background: Detection of a {{heart murmur}} in healthy {{children}} is common, but may generate anxiety among parents. Many parents believe a heart murmur {{is a sign of}} heart disease, although the majority of heart murmurs are innocent. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess anxiety and concerns in parents of children referred for evaluation {{of a heart}} murmur and to evaluate the effect of receiving a fact sheet about heart murmurs before the cardiologic consultation. Methods: Parents of children referred for evaluation of a heart murmur responded to questionnaires assessing family and patient characteristics, parental concerns and anxiety. Anxiety was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) before and two weeks after the consultation. One third of the parents received a fact sheet before the consultation. Results: Two hundred fifty-eight parents of 178 children participated. About 60 % of the parents had an increased level of anxiety before the consultation. The majority of the parents (71 %) had at least one major concern about heart murmurs in children, and having a concern was related to higher anxiety levels (p = 0. 02). <b>Anxious</b> <b>personality</b> and lower education predicted an increased anxiety level. Before the consultation, parents who received a fact sheet presented a lower mean STAI state anxiety level (33. 2) than those who did not (35. 3), but the difference was not significant (p = 0. 09). Fewer parents in the intervention group believed their child would have increased risk of heart disease later in life (p = 0. 04) or that heart murmurs in children represents valvular-or congenital heart disease (p = 0. 02). After the consultation, parental anxiety decreased from a mean STAI state of 34. 9 to 30. 6 (p < 0. 01), and the mean STAI state scores were similar for the control and intervention group. Conclusion: Parents with a child referred for a heart murmur presented a higher mean anxiety level than pre-school parents, and having an <b>anxious</b> <b>personality,</b> a major concern or low education predicted an increased anxiety level. After the consultation, parental anxiety decreased. Receiving a fact sheet about heart murmurs did not significantly reduce parental anxiety levels, but had a modest effect on concerns for the consequences of a heart murmur. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To examine {{quality of}} life (QoL), health status, sexual function, and anxiety in {{patients}} with primary hematuria who later appear to have bladder cancer (BC) and patients with other diagnoses. Methods From July 2007 to July 2010, 598 patients with primary hematuria were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter study. Questionnaires (WHOQOL-BREF, SF- 12, IIEF, STAI- 10 -item Trait) were completed before cystoscopy. Diagnosis was subsequently derived from medical files. BC patients were compared with patients with other causes of hematuria. Results Cancer was diagnosed in 131 patients (21. 9 %), including 102 patients (17. 1 %) with BC. No {{differences were found in}} the WHOQOL-BREF versus SF- 12 psychological or physical health domains. The erectile function was significantly worse in the BC group (9. 3 vs. 14. 6 for OC, p = 0. 02).

40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} was to {{correlate}} results from a survey on otitis media and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test. This survey investigated prevalence of otitis media (OM) in our territory, influence on development of language and personality and social costs. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is a suitable test to differentiate state anxiety caused by a specific event [in this case, otitis media with effusion (OME) ] from a trait anxiety (<b>anxious</b> <b>personality)</b> in parents and caregivers. The otitis media study was conducted, retrospectively, in two primary public schools in Colle Val D’Elsa (Siena) on 252 children (6 - 11 years old). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test had been administered to the parents or caregivers of 20 paediatric outpatients (4 - 12 years, mean 6. 8) at the ENT Department of Siena University. The results of the OM survey showed a correlation between OM and difficulties in speech and reading, delayed answering and limited vocabulary. All these problems improved as children grew up. On the other hand, psycho-social development appeared to be more problematic even in the 4 th and 5 th class, mostly due to persistent attention disturbances. In the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test, 50 % of parents or caregivers had a high state-anxiety score and so were mostly concerned with health status of the children. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory results indicated that 50 % of parents or caregivers had a high trait-anxiety score and thus had an <b>anxious</b> <b>personality.</b> These findings could be helpful in understanding the real severity of symptoms. The two proposed tests could provide complementary data to evaluate children with OME: the OM survey can be used as a screening test to detect children with non-symptomatic OME, to establish whether delayed language development may be associated with OME, to predict prognosis and children’s quality of life as well as social costs of OME; the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test can be used to reveal a state or a trait anxiety in parents and caregivers in order to better understand their point of view. Parents’ and caregivers’ personality has a marked influence on the impact of OME on the children’s quality of life. Quality of life in children with otitis media with effusion is one of the most important parameters to be taken into consideration on account of the possible correlation with problems in development...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{an initial}} {{validation}} study, the Unhelpful Thoughts and Beliefs About Stuttering (UTBAS I) scale, demonstrated excellent psychometric properties as a self-report {{measure of the}} frequency of unhelpful cognitions associated with social anxiety for adults who stutter. Aims: The aim was to further validate the original UTBAS I scale, and to develop two additional scales to assess beliefs (UTBAS II) and anxiety (UTBAS III) associated with negative thoughts. Methods & Procedures: A total of 140 adults seeking speech-restructuring treatment for stuttering completed the original UTBAS I scale, the newly developed UTBAS II and III scales, and self-report measures of psychological functioning. Participants also completed a first-stage screener {{for the presence of}} <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> disorder, and a diagnostic assessment to evaluate the presence of social phobia, according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10). Outcomes & Results: The mean UTBAS I score for the present sample did not differ significantly from the mean score reported in the original UTBAS I validation study. Convergent validity was confirmed by significant correlations between the UTBAS Total score and all anxiety-related measures. Discriminant validity was established by the absence of strong correlations between the UTBAS Total score and some of the self-report measures of unrelated constructs, although it was found to tap into the negative cognitions associated with depression and life problems. Approximately one-quarter of participants met criteria for a diagnosis of DSM-IV or ICD- 10 social phobia (23. 5 % and 27. 2 % respectively), and nearly one-third met first-stage screening criteria for <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> disorder (30 %). The mean UTBAS scores for participants who met criteria for these disorders were significantly higher than scores for participants who did not, confirming known-groups validity. Conclusions & Implications: The present study demonstrates the validity and utility of the UTBAS scales in assessing negative cognitions associated with speech-related anxiety among adults who stutter. Results also confirm previous evidence of a high rate of social phobia among adults who stutter, and reveal that the UTBAS discriminates between adults with and without social phobia. In terms of clinical applications, the UTBAS scales could be used to screen for indicators of social phobia among adults who stutter, and may prove useful in identifying negative cognitions which have the potential to impact treatment outcomes. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} rationale was the author’s Functional Model of Health (FMH), where health is {{construed as a}} function of creative coping with stress. Participants in the study were 141 patients with blood cancer (80 men and 61 women) treated with bone marrow transplantation at the Hematology Clinic, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum. Besides a standardized interview the following instruments were used: STAI by Spielberger, CISS and CHIP by Endler and Parker, and SOC- 29 by Antonovsky. Health status was operationalized using 10 -point self-rating scales to assess the patients’ perceived health and sense of calmness, while their objective health was rated by a medical expert - hematologist. In the statistical analyses significant correlations were found between stress level and the patients’ subjective health (- 0. 34, p< 0. 001). The following variables predicted stress intensity: <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> (. 585), distraction coping strategy (-. 202), female sex (. 201), and sense of meaningfulness (-. 190). Subjective health predictors of leukemia patients are: objective health (β =. 413), level of stress (β = -. 285), by the patient’s sense of meaningfulness (β =. 244) and focusing on negative emotions (β = -. 193).

40|$|PTSD is {{a complex}} disorder, which {{frequently}} occurs in comorbidity with <b>anxious</b> disorder, <b>personality</b> disorder, addiction or substance abuse disorder, depressive disorder with or without psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorder. PTSD symptoms may result from deregulation of several different neurotransmitter systems. Pharmacotherapy of PTSD depends on clinical features {{and the presence of}} comorbid disorders. Pharmacotherapy of PTSD involves use of anxiolytics, adrenergic receptor antagonists, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and novel antipsychotics. Serotoninergic effect of antidepressants is not only effective in treating depression, but also appears to be helpful in PTSD treatment, particularly in reduction of intrusive symptoms, emotional reactivity, impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal ideation. Anypsychotics with serotoninergic-dopaminergic antagonism are being prescribed often in treatment of psychotic depression, while in PTSD treatment they are proved to be efficient in relieving intrusive symptoms and nightmares. Quetiapine as serotoninergic-dopaminergic antagonist is efficient in treatment of chronic insomnia as well as inreduction of aggressiveness. Considering PTSD refractoriness to therapy, high incidence of comorbidity and significant functional impairment, it is important to search for new psychopharmacological combinations in order to improve mental status of the patient.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is an idiopathic {{and chronic}} pain condition for which patients may experience {{high levels of}} pain, anxiety, and depression. So far, {{it has not yet}} been well investigated whether specific psychiatric features (<b>anxious</b> traits, <b>personality</b> disorder, or somatization) {{may play a role in}} the BMS pathogenesis or whether some BMS symptoms, or BMS itself, may cause secondary psychiatric symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pain, depression, and anxiety in BMS and healthy patients in order to hypothesize a possible underlying pathogenetic model. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with BMS and 51 healthy volunteers matched for sex and age were enrolled. All patients underwent a physical examination, laboratory screening tests, and psychiatric assessment with the following instruments: Visual Analog Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y 1 - 2 (STAI Y 1 -Y 2), and the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R). RESULTS: BMS patients and healthy volunteers showed a statistically significant difference in psychiatric features: Regression analysis showed that pain is affected by depression (R =  0. 373; R(2) corrected =  0. 123; F =  8. 563; P < . 005), and depression is affected by anxiety (R =  0. 512; R(2) corrected =  0. 248; F =  18. 519; P < . 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TCBT) manuals {{delivered}} in individual format {{have been reported}} to be just as effective as traditional diagnosis specific CBT manuals. We have translated and modified the 2 ̆ 01 cThe Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders 2 ̆ 01 d (UP-CBT) for group delivery in Mental Health Service (MHS), and shown effects comparable to traditional CBT in a naturalistic study. As the use of one manual instead of several diagnosis-specific manuals could simplify logistics, reduce waiting time, and increase therapist expertise compared to diagnosis specific CBT, we aim to test the relative efficacy of group UP-CBT and diagnosis specific group CBT. Methods/design The study is a partially blinded, pragmatic, non-inferiority, parallel, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) of UP-CBT vs diagnosis specific CBT for Unipolar Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder and Agoraphobia/Panic Disorder. In total, 248 patients are recruited from three regional MHS centers across Denmark and included in two intervention arms. The primary outcome is patient-ratings of well-being (WHO Well-being Index, WHO- 5), secondary outcomes include level of depressive and <b>anxious</b> symptoms, <b>personality</b> variables, emotion regulation, reflective functioning, and social adjustment. Assessments are conducted before and after therapy and at 60 months follow-up. Weekly patient-rated outcomes and group evaluations are collected for every session. Outcome assessors, blind to treatment allocation, will perform the observer-based symptom ratings, and fidelity assessors will monitor manual adherence. Discussion The current study will be the first RCT investigating the dissemination of the UP in a MHS setting, the UP {{delivered in}} groups, and with depressive patients included. Hence the results are expected to add substantially to the evidence base for rational group psychotherapy in MHS. The planned moderator and mediator analyses could spur new hypotheses about mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and the association between patient characteristics and treatment effect.

40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging {{revealed}} that trait anxiety predicts the microstructural properties of a prespecified fiber tract between the amygdala and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. Besides this particular pathway, {{it is likely}} that other pathways are also affected. We investigated white matter differences in persons featuring an anxious or a nonanxious personality, taking into account all potential pathway connections between amygdala and anxiety-related regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Diffusion-weighted images, measures of trait anxiety and of reappraisal use (an effective emotion-regulation style), were collected in 48 females. With probabilistic tractography, pathways between the amygdala and the dorsolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were delineated. The resulting network showed a direct ventral connection between amygdala and PFC and a second limbic connection following the fornix and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Reappraisal use predicted the microstructure of pathways to all calculated PFC regions in the left hemisphere, indicating stronger pathways for persons with high reappraisal use. Trait anxiety predicted the microstructure in pathways to the ventromedial PFC and OFC, indexing weaker connections in trait-anxious persons. These effects appeared in the right hemisphere, supporting lateralization and top-down inhibition theories of emotion processing. Whereas a specific microstructure is associated with an <b>anxious</b> <b>personality,</b> a different structure subserves emotion regulation.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder (OCD) is {{a frequent}} psychiatric disorder. Despite its significant influence on personal development, {{little is known about}} its long-term course in children and adolescents. The aim was to follow children and adolescents with OCD for 7 years and to compare patients gaining remission with patients experiencing symptoms. Methods: The study was a prospective follow-up study in which the patients were interviewed 7 years after their initial contact with the healthcare system. The patients had been described at baseline. Results: Among the 95 participants, 53 participants described symptoms at follow-up and 44 participants described remission. More patients with persistent symptoms described an <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> trait. The schizoid/compulsive personality traits were represented at a higher rate in the group with persistent symptoms than in the group with remission symptoms. Important predictive factors included predisposition to OCD, the occurrence of comorbid disorders and older referral age. The occurrence of magic obsessions and repetitive compulsions increased the risk of OC symptoms at follow-up. The group “late responders” differed from the non-responder group by predisposition to depression. Conclusions: The present clinical study is one of the longest follow-up studies conducted in children and adolescents with OCD. In addition to confirming several previous findings, the study added new knowledge about the importance of phenotypic presentation, personality traits and quality of life. Furthermore, the late responder group has been described in relation to the remission group and to the group with persistent symptoms...|$|E

The goal of our {{study was to determine}} whether there is an association between current anxiety and anxiety tendency in patients with acute coronary syndrome. A secondary goal was to establish possible distinct features of acute coronary syndromes in patients with the anxiety. Methods and results: Our study included 30 patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome. To obtain additional data on physical and mental health, we applied specially designed and validated questionnaires. In a groups without the anxiety and intensive anxiety there were no patients, while in the group with mild anxiety there were 21 patients (70 %) and 9 patients had moderate anxiety (30 %). The average number of hospital treatments was significantly higher in patients with moderate anxiety (average 2. 3). Patients who were first time hospitalized due to cardiovascular disease, at the highest percentage (81 %) had low current anxiety. Those patients who had intensive anxiety traits and propensity to anxiety response had the highest average number of hospital days (9 days). Patients who had intensive anxiety traits had the lowest values of internal locus of control (had feeling that only themselves were cause of the disease). Conclusions: Current anxiety and <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> structure are strongly associated with the course of the coronary heart disease.

Conclusions. - We may hypothesize that anxiety could determine a secondary demoralization in BMS patients (depression) and depressive symptoms could contribute to pain, accordingly. Therefore, pain could be a somatic feature of depression. Our findings provide an example of a possible pathogenetic model for BM...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with {{personality}} disorders (especially paranoid personality disorder) {{tend to be}} reluctant to engage in treatment. This paper aimed to elucidate the role of personality disorder in predicting engagement with psychological treatment for depression. The Outcomes of Depression International Network (ODIN) involves six urban and three rural study sites throughout Europe at which cases of depression were identified through a two-stage community survey. One patient in seven who was offered psychological treatment for depression had a comorbid diagnosis of personality disorder (most commonly paranoid personality disorder). Forty-five percent of patients who were offered psychological treatment for depression did not complete treatment. The odds of completion were higher for patients with a comorbid diagnosis of personality disorder, especially paranoid, <b>anxious</b> or dependent <b>personality</b> disorder. The relatively low number of cases with some specific {{personality disorders}} (e. g. schizoid personality disorder) limited the study 2 ̆ 7 s power to reach conclusions about these specific disorders. This study focused on a community-based sample which may lead to apparently lower rates of engagement when compared to studies based on treatment-seeking populations. Episodes of depression {{in the context of}} personality disorder may represent a valuable opportunity to engage with patients who might otherwise resist engagement...|$|R
40|$|Suicide {{rates are}} higher {{in later life}} {{than in any other}} age group. The design of {{effective}} suicide prevention strategies hinges on the identification of specific, quantifiable risk factors. Methodological challenges include the lack of systematically applied terminology in suicide and risk factor research, the low base rate of suicide, and its complex, multidetermined nature. Although variables in mental, physical, and social domains have been correlated with completed suicide in older adults, controlled studies are necessary to test hypothesized risk factors. Prospective cohort and retro-spective case control studies indicate that affective disor-der is a powerful independent risk factor for suicide in elders. Other mental illnesses play less of a role. Physical illness and functional impairment increase risk, but their influence appears to be mediated by depression. Social ties and their disruption are significantly and indepen-dently associated with risk for suicide in later life, rela-tionships between which may be moderated by a rigid, <b>anxious,</b> and obsessional <b>personality</b> style. Affective illness is a highly potent risk factor for suicide in later life with clear implications for the design of prevention strategies. Additional research is needed to define more precisely the interactions between emotional, physical, and social factors that determine risk for suicide in the older adult.

40|$|Objective: We {{found out}} the {{personality}} pattern of an incontinent population and proceeded to a correlation between the personality inventory and the ICIQ-UI-SF (International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence Short Form) to demonstrate reliability and sincerity of the answers and to establish that a personality disturbance may impact the physiopathology of micturition. Materials and methods: We performed an observational prospective study. It included patient's answers to a computed questionnaire combining a double ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaire and the 71 questions of the Minimult questionnaire. Forty-seven patients were asked to participate. Results: Over 37 patients included, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney non parametric test confirmed agreement of the two ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaires with P = 0. 1792. Twenty-three patients were validated to the Minimult inventory with F scale < 70. We analysed variability of the two global ICIQ-UI-SF score in regard with the validity scale using ROC analysis. We observed an AUC of 0. 559 with sensitivity 78. 6 % and specificity 43. 5 %. No L score was above 70 demonstrating absence of lie. No personality disturbance was found in 9 cases. We observed six cases with a high hypochondric value, five with a high depressive value, and four with a high hysteric value. This neurotic triad was found in two cases. We noticed five cases with psychopathic deviance relative to antisocial behaviour while values of paranoia and hypomania were high in one case without any association of these personality aspects, which demonstrated absence of behavioural problem. Psychotic profile associating schizophrenia, paranoia, depression and hypomania was not found. We outlined in half of the valid population a significant high psycho-asthenic pattern. Conclusion: We conclude that a correlation between the personality inventory and the ICIQ-UI-SF is feasible. The comparative study demonstrate reliability of answers. Sincerity is established by the Minimult L scale. We confirm and precise literature information over clinical personality pattern of this population and observe relevant elements concerning the psycho-asthenic pattern which depicts an <b>anxious</b> <b>personality</b> with an important feeling of the problem. These elements permit to suspect that a personality disturbance may impact the physiopathology of the micturition. Level of evidence: 4. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} predictors of aversive events allows organisms to appropriately respond to these events, and failure to acquire these fear contingencies can lead to maladaptive contextual anxiety. Recently, preclinical studies demonstrated that the corticotropin-releasing factor and serotonin systems are interactively involved in adaptive fear acquisition. Here, 150 healthy medication-free human subjects completed a cue and context fear conditioning procedure in a virtual reality environment. Fear potentiation of the eyeblink startle reflex (FPS) was measured to assess both uninstructed fear acquisition and instructed fear expression. All participants were genotyped for polymorphisms located within regulatory regions of the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR 1 - rs 878886) and the serotonin transporter (5 HTTLPR). These polymorphisms have previously been linked to panic disorder and <b>anxious</b> symptomology and <b>personality,</b> respectively. G-allele carriers of CRHR 1 (rs 878886) showed no acquisition of fear conditioned responses (FPS) to the threat cue in the uninstructed phase, whereas fear acquisition was present in C/C homozygotes. Moreover, carrying the risk alleles of both rs 878886 (G-allele) and 5 HTTLPR (short allele) was associated with increased FPS to the threat context during this phase. After explicit instructions regarding the threat contingency were given, the cue FPS and context FPS normalized in all genotype groups. The present results indicate that genetic variability in the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1, especially in interaction with the 5 HTTLPR, {{is involved in the}} acquisition of fear in humans. This translates prior anima...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{relationship}} between level of personality organization and type of personality disorder as assessed with the categories in the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM; PDM Task Force, 2006) and the emotional responses of treating clinicians. We asked 148 Italian clinicians to assess 1 of their adult patients in treatment for personality disorders with the Psychodiagnostic Chart (PDC; Gordon & Bornstein, 2012) and the Personality Diagnostic Prototype (PDP; Gazzillo, Lingiardi, & Del Corno, 2012) and to complete the Therapist Response Questionnaire (TRQ; Betan, Heim, Zittel-Conklin, & Westen, 2005). The patients’ level of overall personality pathology was positively associated with helpless and overwhelmed responses in clinicians and negatively associated with positive emotional responses. A parental and disengaged response was associated with the depressive, <b>anxious,</b> and dependent <b>personality</b> disorders; an exclusively parental response with the phobic personality disorder; and a parental and criticized response with narcissistic disorder. Dissociative disorder evoked a helpless and parental response in the treating clinicians whereas somatizing disorder elicited a disengaged reaction. An overwhelmed and disengaged response was associated with sadistic and masochistic personality disorders, with the latter also associated with a parental and hostile/criticized reaction; an exclusively overwhelmed response with psychopathic patients; and a helpless response with paranoid patients. Finally, patients with histrionic personality disorder evoked an overwhelmed and sexualized response in their clinicians whereas there was no specific emotional reaction associated with the schizoid and the obsessive-compulsive disorders. Clinical implications of these findings were discussed...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} physical fitness after participation in 1 of 2 psychomotor therapy programs in a sample group of non-psychotic psychiatric patients. METHODS: Experimental design: randomized controlled parallel group trial with follow-up measures after 8 weeks and after 16 weeks. Setting: 3 treatment units of a university psychiatric hospital in Belgium. Patients: 141 (51 males, 90 females) patients with severe depressive and/or <b>anxious</b> symptoms, and/or <b>personality</b> disorders. Interventions: patients followed a personalized psychomotor fitness program (PF), consisting of aerobic and resistance training, or a general program of psychomotor therapy (GPMT), consisting of different forms of physical exercises and relaxation training. Measures: the maximum dynamic strength, the strength endurance and physical work capacity at 60 % and 80 % of the estimated maximal heart rate reserve. RESULTS: After 8 weeks {{it was observed that}} the PF group enhanced in all parameters of cardio-respiratory as well as muscular fitness; the GPMT group had improved in 7 out of the 9 muscular fitness measurements. At the end of the 16 weeks, both groups had shown an improvement in all of the muscular fitness parameters, but only the PF group had increased in cardio-respiratory fitness. CONCLUSION: In order to improve both muscular and cardio-respiratory fitness in these patients, a balanced personalized training program, which includes aerobic and resistance training, is necessary during a period of at least 8 weeks. The less specific GPMT, when followed for a period of 16 weeks, is sufficient for improving muscular fitness and for maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Migraine is a {{disorder}} that has debilitating pain, and affects {{all aspects of}} life, including the academic, social, and family life of patients. In addition, studies show the effects of migraine on patient's relationships with family members such as spouse, children, and other family members. In addition to physical pain, migraines are tied to significant psychological and economic costs. Migraineurs tend to {{have high levels of}} depression and anxiety, and migraine headaches have a profoundly negative impact on sufferers’ quality of life. In the present research, we investigated the correlations and regressions of cognitive, personality, and family factors with migraine headache, to find predictor factors of migraine. In this study, the following questionnaires were used: For migraine: six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT- 6), and Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 2. 1.; for cognitive factors: Irrational Beliefs Test and Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale; for personality factors: NEO Personality Inventory; and for family factors: Family Assessment Device. This project was on 58 women with migraine headaches, diagnosed by neurologist. The findings show that, there is a significant regression between cognitive, personality, and family factors and HIT- 6. In cognitive factors, frustration reactivity and <b>anxious</b> overconcern, in <b>personality</b> factors, extraversion trait, and in family factors, affective involvement are significant. Moreover, there is a significant regression between cognitive, personality, and family factors and MSQ. In cognitive factors, frustration reactivity, anxious overconcern, and helplessness, in personality factors, agreeableness and consciousness, and in family factors, affective involvement and general functioning are significant. This project showed that cognitive, personality, and family factors have a correlation with migraine headache. </div...|$|R
40|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} (BED) and {{seasonal affective disorder}} (SAD) were first described as clinically-relevant conditions in very close temporal proximity a few decades ago. Both disorders have a higher prevalence rate in woman than in men, are characterized by a high proneness-to-stress and manifest heightened responsiveness to high-calorie, hyper-palatable foods. In recent years, a compelling body of evidence suggests that foods high in sugar and fat {{have the potential to}} alter brain reward circuitry {{in a manner similar to}} that seen when addictive drugs like alcohol and heroin are consumed in excess. These findings have led to suggestions that some cases of compulsive overeating may be understood as an addiction to sweet, fatty, and salty foods. In this paper, it is proposed that high seasonality is a risk factor for binge eating, especially in those characterized by <b>anxious</b> and impulsive <b>personality</b> traits – associations that could only occur in an environment with a superfluity of, and easy access to, rich and tasty foods. Given the well-established links between binge eating and addiction disorders (22 - 24 for reviews), it is also suggested that seasonality, together with the same high-risk psychological profile, exacerbates the likelihood of engaging in a broad range of addictive behaviors. Data from a community sample (n= 412) of adults tested these models using linear regression procedures. Results confirmed that symptoms of binge eating and other addictive behaviors were significantly inter-correlated, and that seasonality, gender, and addictive personality traits were strong statistical predictors of the variance in binge-eating scores. Seasonality and addictive personality traits also accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in the measure of addictive behaviors. Conclusions are discussed in the context of brain reward mechanisms, motivational alternations in response to chronic over-consumption, and their relevance for the treatment of exces...|$|R
