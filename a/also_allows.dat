5|$|A {{partnership}} with nearby Florida International University, <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> students from both schools to take graduate classes at either university, allowing graduate {{students to take}} {{a wider variety of}} courses. In addition, the Miller School of Medicine offers separate PhD and MD/PhD programs in several biomedical sciences.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{can be both}} gonochoristic (unisexual) and hermaphroditic, each {{of which}} can {{reproduce}} sexually and asexually. Reproduction <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> coral to settle in new areas.|$|E
5|$|Nødnett ensures 100% {{coverage}} of populated and surrounding areas, which exceeds {{any of the}} existing GSM networks. This includes good coverage indoors, to aid fire fighters, as well as full {{coverage of}} the coastline and coverage up to 2,500meters (8,000ft) height for aircraft. Nødnett gives full coverage along all national and county roads. The system <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> interoperability towards the maritime radio. The network <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> for transmission of data at a speed of 12-13 kbit/s.|$|E

50|$|Other peculiarities to {{the area}} include the ancient right for 'sheep badgers' to let their flocks roam freely and pigs were <b>also</b> <b>allowed</b> to forage freely in the Forest. Firewood was <b>also</b> <b>allowed</b> to be {{gathered}} from the local Hudnalls wood.|$|R

5|$|The A45 dual {{carriageway}} skirting to the south, links {{the town with}} the A14, and M1 which <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> links {{to the east and}} west of the country. The A45 links Wellingborough with Northampton, Rushden, Higham Ferrers, Raunds, Thrapston, Oundle and Peterborough.|$|E

5|$|As of 2015, Qapital {{can connect}} {{to more than}} 180 other apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Instagram. For example, {{connecting}} to Jawbone allows the user to set a rule that if they take {{a certain number of}} steps during the day, a set amount of money is transferred to savings. The app <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> users to monitor activity among their other financial accounts, such as deposits and withdrawals.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use plumage {{to assess}} and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> for the identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored 2 {{received}} later updates. A New Game Plus mode {{was made}} available on 19 December 2016, which <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> the player access to both protagonists' powers {{in a single}} playthrough. Customizable difficulty settings along with a mission-select option were postponed to 23 January 2017 for all platforms. A standalone expansion, , was released on 15 September 2017. It follows Billie Lurk and Daud the assassin as they embark {{on a mission to}} kill the Outsider.|$|E
5|$|Geography <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> Denver {{to have a}} {{considerable}} government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city {{by virtue of its}} being the capital of the state of Colorado. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant Rocky Flats, the Denver Federal Center, Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse, the Denver Mint, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} edition of Ninja Gaiden 3 (2012), Ayane only appears in one cutscene, {{in which she}} loans Hayate's sword to Ryu. , an expanded version of the game, features Ayane as a playable character with her own new missions: a campaign involving the returning Black Spider Clan, {{as well as being}} available to fight alongside Ryu—like in Σ 2—in an online cooperative multiplayer mode. A new Chapter Challenge mode <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> the player to attempt any part of the game using Ayane.|$|E
5|$|In this Proposition, Newton derives the {{consequences}} of his theorem of revolving orbits in the limit of nearly circular orbits. This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth. This approximation <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> Newton to consider a great variety of central force laws, not merely inverse-square and inverse-cube force laws.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

5|$|Separately, the {{experimental}} Arwinss branch was created {{as an alternative}} means to improve USER32 and GDI32 support through an alternative implementation of the Win32 API. Whereas ReactOS's original Win32 subsystem was closely modeled after its equivalent in Windows, Arwinss combines the architecture of that subsystem with the corresponding implementation in Wine. To this end, Arwinss uses Wine's GDI32 and USER32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of Wine's existing software compatibility. Arwinss <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> the user to optionally use a remote X server instead of a local display.|$|E
5|$|Stela 53 is a {{fragment}} of sculpture that {{was found in the}} latter Early Preclassic phase of Structure12, directly behind Stela 5. Stela53 forms a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. Stela5 was placed {{at the same time that}} Stela53 was embedded in Structure12, and the long count date on the former <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> the placing of Stela53 to be fixed in time at Late Preclassic–Early Classic transition.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{created a}} new offence for {{publishing}} obscene material, repealing the common law offence of obscene libel which was previously used, and <b>also</b> <b>allows</b> Justices of the Peace to issue warrants allowing the police to seize such materials. At {{the same time it}} creates two defences; firstly, the defence of innocent dissemination, and secondly the defence of public good. The Act has been used in several high-profile cases, such as the trials of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover and Oz for the Schoolkids OZ issue.|$|E
