5|$|To {{develop the}} game's overall aesthetic, the main <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to create designs that would combine comic book style with realism. The {{environmental}} architecture and characters {{had to be}} extravagant enough to represent the Batman universe, but needed realistic texture and detail. The second <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to recreate the dark, Gothic imagery inherent to the Batman universe, especially Arkham Asylum, so that the structure would feel as insane as those whom it houses. The asylum was considered an ideal location because it can house many of Batman's foes.|$|E
5|$|Various Estonian troops, {{which used}} {{men who had}} deserted from the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian), Omakaitse militia, border defence and {{auxiliary}} police battalions, had no general planning.

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> {{to draw attention}} to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E

5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December 1963, Indonesian {{had sent}} a {{commando}} unit consisting of 128 volunteers and 35 regular soldiers to Sebatik. Their <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to take Kalabakan, then invade Tawau and Sandakan. On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E
40|$|Computers {{have become}} commonplace in our {{personal}} {{as well as}} our professional lives. Computers have made many of our everyday tasks easier and faster and made our society more productive. A very important set of variables such as the classroom teacher and the teacher’s attitudes towards the effective uses of computers in the classroom have been overlooked in EFL classrooms. This study investigates how teachers perceive the use of computer technology resources in English Language Teaching. The first aim of the study is to define the teachers’ attitudes. The second <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to discuss the aspects of attitude. The third <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to explain teachers’ attitudes and computer technology training. The fourth <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to elaborate teachers’ attitudes and computer technology integration. The fifth <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to define teachers’ attitudes and computer experience. The sixth <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to discuss teachers’ attitudes and computer anxiety and interest. The last <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to review teachers’ attitudes and computer literacy. The review of the related literature shows that simply introducing computer technology resources does not guarantee teachers’ use of these in practice. Knowledge of EFL teachers’ attitudes about teaching, learning, and computers, affords them the opportunity to design and implement EFL instruction...|$|R

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> {{to create a more}} accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E

When he heard the news of fifth column-led revolts within the flanking 4th Army, Trifunović was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by Petrović. The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet, with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E
5|$|Finnish–Estonian {{relations}} were closest diplomatically after the Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close. From the Finnish point of view, the close relations with Estonia did not exclude the Scandinavian neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the military {{relations were}} top secret, and the countries held joint military exercises. The central <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> {{to prevent the}} Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the Gulf of Finland against either country. Estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E

Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, the <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to bribe the SS {{with money from}} Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|Formby's ENSA {{commitments}} were heavy, touring factories, theatres {{and concert}} halls around Britain. He also gave free concerts for charities and worthy causes, and raised £10,000 for the Fleetwood Fund {{on behalf of}} the families of missing trawlermen. He and Beryl also set up their own charities, such as the OK Club for Kids, whose <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to provide cigarettes for Yorkshire soldiers, and the Jump Fund, to provide home-knitted balaclavas, scarves and socks to servicemen. Formby also joined the Home Guard as a dispatch rider, where he took his duties seriously, and fitted them around his other work whenever he could.|$|E

Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E

5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
