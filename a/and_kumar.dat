5|$|Test cricket is {{the oldest}} form of cricket played at {{international}} level. A Test match takes place {{over a period of}} five days, and is played by teams representing Full Member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Sri Lanka obtained Full Member status of the ICC in 1981, becoming the eighth nation eligible to play Test cricket. The Sri Lanka national cricket team played their first Test match on 17 February 1982 against England, and recorded their first victory in a match against India on 6 September 1985. Since then, they have played nearly 200 matches, against every other Test-playing nation. Sri Lanka holds the world record for the highest team score, which was established against India in 1997. The highest partnership in Test cricket was also established by two Sri Lankan batsmen; Mahela Jayawardene <b>and</b> <b>Kumar</b> Sangakkara. Sri Lankan players also hold the highest partnership scores for the second and third wickets.|$|E
5|$|The Chennai Super Kings's Mahendra Singh Dhoni {{has played}} the most number of matches as a captain, leading {{the team in}} 96 matches with a win–loss {{percentage}} of 61.05. The best win–loss percentage among captains who have captained more than ten matches, Mumbai Indians's Rohit Sharma has the best win–loss percentage: 76.92. Dhoni has won the most number of matches playing as a captain, with 58; whereas Adam Gilchrist has lost the most number of matches playing as a captain: 39. Mahela Jayawardene <b>and</b> <b>Kumar</b> Sangakkara are the only players to captain three teams: the former has captained the Delhi Daredevils, the Kings XI Punjab and the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, whereas the latter has captained the Deccan Chargers, the Kings XI, and the Sunrisers Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{also suffered}} from financial problems, and Asif exceeded the budget {{on a number}} of occasions. The final budget of the film is a subject of debate. Some sources state that Mughal-e-Azam cost 10.5 million to produce (about US$2 million at the time), while others claim that it cost 15million, about $3 million. This made Mughal-e-Azam the most expensive Indian film of the period. A number of estimates put the film's inflation-adjusted budget at 500 million to 2billion. The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji, while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members; differences crept up between Asif <b>and</b> <b>Kumar</b> when the former married the latter's sister. Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break-up of Kumar and Madhubala, who had been dating for nine years.|$|E

5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras <b>and</b> <b>Kumar,</b> Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E
