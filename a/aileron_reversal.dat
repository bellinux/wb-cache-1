40|$|The {{effect of}} large-droplet ice {{accretion}} on aircraft control {{and in particular}} lateral control is examined. Supercooled large droplet icing conditions can result {{in the formation of}} a ridge of ice aft of the upper surface boot. By comparing this ice shape to data acquired with a spanwise protuberance on a different airfoil, it is clear that a ridge of ice aft of the boot can lead to large losses in lift, increases in drag and changes in the pitching moment. This effect is most likely due to the formation of a large separation bubble aft of the ice accretion which grows with angle of attack and eventually fails to reattach, leading to premature airfoil stall. The bubble alters the pressure distribution about the airfoil resulting in a more trailing edge up (negative) hinge moment on the aileron and the resulting change in aileron stick force. This can lead to <b>aileron</b> hinge moment <b>reversal</b> and <b>aileron</b> snatch. In aileron snatch the hinge moments are altered {{to the extent that the}} aileron [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three main parts. The first part is to discuss <b>aileron</b> <b>reversal</b> problem for a typical section with linear aerodynamic and structural analysis. The result gives some insight and ideas for this aeroelastic problem. Although the aileron in its post-reversal state will work the opposite of its design, this type of phenomenon as a design root should {{not be ruled out}} on these grounds alone, as current active flight-control systems can compensate for this. Moreover, one can get considerably more (negative) lift for positive flap angle in this unusual regime than positive lift for positive flap angle in the more conventional setting. This may have important implications for development of highly maneuverable aircraft. The second part is to involve the nonlinear aerodynamic and structural analyses into the <b>aileron</b> <b>reversal</b> problem. Two models, a uniform cantilevered lifting surface and a rolling aircraft with rectangular wings, are investigated here. Both models have trailing-edge control surfaces attached to the main wings. A configuration that reverses at a relatively low dynamic pressure and flies with the enhanced controls at a higher level of effectiveness is demonstrated. To evaluate how reliable for the data from XFOIL, the data for the wing-aileron system from advanced CFD codes and experiment are used to compare with that from XFOIL. To enhance rolling maneuverability for an aircraft, the third part is to search for the optimal configuration during the post-reversal regime from a design point of view. Aspect ratio, hinge location, airfoil dimension, inner structure of wing section, composite skin, aeroelastic tailoring, and airfoil selection are investigated for cantilevered wing and rolling aircraft models, respectively. Based on these parametric structural designs as well as the aerodynamic characteristics of different airfoils, recommendations are given to expand AAW flight program. Ph. D.
