5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} {{came in for}} discussion during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were not suitable for ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available by the spring, 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were rescued from the sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had rescued 1,684 <b>aircrew</b> out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 <b>aircrew</b> and 60 other personnel were rescued. During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal Command. In all, 10,663 persons were rescued by Coastal Command in ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied <b>aircrew,</b> 277 enemy <b>aircrew,</b> and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E
5|$|All of the <b>aircrew</b> {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's <b>aircrew</b> were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The AATTC also trains {{qualified}} USMC and Special Operations Forces (SOF) <b>aircrews.</b> These SOF <b>aircrews</b> include MC-130 Combat Talon, AC-130 Spectre gunship <b>aircrews</b> and Combat Search and Rescue HC-130 Air Rescue Service [...] The AATTC also trains USAF and AFRC C-17 <b>aircrews,</b> C-130 <b>aircrews</b> from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Great Britain, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, {{as well as}} C-160 crews from Germany, G-222 crews from Italy AND C295 crews from Spain.|$|R
50|$|Since October 2008, the 185th Air Refueling Squadron <b>aircrews</b> jointly {{operate the}} KC-135R Stratotanker {{aircraft}} at Tinker AFB with the <b>aircrews</b> of the Air Force Reserve 465th Air Refueling Squadron.|$|R

5|$|Twelve C-130Js are {{operated}} by No.37 Squadron, also based at Richmond under No.84 Wing. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, search-and-rescue, and airdrop missions. No.285 Squadron manages the full-flight mission simulator (FFMS) used to convert <b>aircrew</b> to the C-130J, {{as well as}} decommissioned Hercules airframes used for loadmaster training. It also employs computer-based training tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No.37 Squadron when required. As well as training <b>aircrew</b> new to the C-130J, the FFMS (maintained by CAE Australia) is employed for existing <b>aircrew</b> to maintain their currency.|$|E
5|$|Headquarters Air Combat Group {{is located}} at RAAF Williamtown, with {{elements}} based at Amberley (Queensland), Tindal (Northern Territory), Pearce (Western Australia) and Williamtown (New South Wales). One hundred forty-five aircraft, 163 <b>aircrew,</b> and around 2000 personnel make up the ACG.|$|E
5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the <b>aircrew</b> for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 <b>aircrew</b> are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E

50|$|The rate of barodontalgia {{was about}} 1 case per 100 flight-years in the Israeli Air Force. During World War II, about one-tenth of American <b>aircrews</b> {{had one or}} more episodes of barodontalgia. In a recent study, 8.2% of 331 Israeli Air Force <b>aircrews,</b> {{reported}} at least one episode of barodontalgia.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} Bergstrom during World War II {{and the early}} postwar years was the {{training}} of transport aircraft <b>aircrews.</b> Generally, <b>aircrews</b> were formed at other airfields and received their primary training there. Once that was completed, they received advanced training at Bergstrom {{before moving on to}} their operational units overseas.|$|R
5|$|No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were {{replaced}} with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As {{part of the}} transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining <b>aircrew</b> were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No.1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement <b>aircrew</b> were posted from No.2 Squadron. The squadron suffered a number of accidents during the next two years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No.6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No.2 Squadron to bring that unit up to its full strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No.6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training <b>aircrew</b> for service in South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} stated that heavy losses in {{carriers}} and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully {{have stated that}} the heavy losses in veteran <b>aircrew</b> (110, just under 25% of the <b>aircrew</b> embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling to the Japanese naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified <b>aircrew</b> {{at the start of}} the Pacific war. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.|$|E
5|$|The April 1942 {{reorganisation}} {{that created}} the Allied Land Forces and Allied Naval Forces also created the Allied Air Forces under Brett. Unlike MacArthur, Brett created a completely integrated headquarters, with a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, as his chief of staff. Each United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) staff officer was paired with a RAAF officer, with the senior staff posts divided evenly between them. A majority of command positions were held by Australians. To make up shortages of USAAF <b>aircrew,</b> RAAF <b>aircrew</b> were assigned to USAAF air groups, serving in every role except aircraft commander.|$|E
5000|$|... 22 May 1943: Combat {{training}} was completed at NAS Kaneohe Bay. VP-11 <b>aircrews</b> departed for Perth, Australia, followed later by ground crew and squadron assets in transports. Upon arrival in Perth on 8 June <b>aircrews</b> commenced combat search and reconnaissance patrols {{in the southwest}} Paciﬁc under the operational control of FAW-10.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} trained B-25 Mitchell replacement <b>aircrews</b> from, September 1942-April 1944. It {{has conducted}} worldwide air refueling from, 1955-1993 and since 1994. The 70th supported the National Emergency Airborne Command Post from 1970 to 1993. It also deployed <b>aircrews</b> and aircraft to Europe and the Arabian peninsula during the Gulf War from, 1990-1991.|$|R

5|$|The Fleet Air Arm units {{selected}} for Operation Tungsten conducted intensive training from February 1944. A {{high proportion of}} the airmen were inexperienced, and the captain of Victorious estimated that 85 per cent of the <b>aircrew</b> embarked on his ship had not previously operated at sea. The training program was centred on Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland which, like Kaafjord, was surrounded by steep hills. Flying from RNAS Hatston in the Orkney Islands, the <b>aircrew</b> practised manoeuvring around this terrain to familiarise themselves with the tactics needed to avoid German anti-aircraft guns and successfully attack Tirpitz. The Royal Navy drew on intelligence on the defences of Kaafjord to make the exercise range as similar to the conditions around Tirpitz as was possible, and the <b>aircrew</b> were extensively briefed on the locations of German positions. An {{area the size of}} the battleship was also marked out on an island in the centre of the loch and repeatedly bombed.|$|E
5|$|The {{trainees}} came {{mainly from}} Britain {{but also from}} Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, USA, Yugoslavia, Greece, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Fiji and Malta. In total 8,500 British <b>aircrew</b> were trained in Southern Rhodesia during the War.|$|E
5|$|The two {{opposing}} carrier forces confronted {{each other on}} the morning of October 26, in {{what became known as the}} Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retreated because of high aircraft and <b>aircrew</b> losses and significant damage to two carriers. This was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, but the loss of veteran aircrews was a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose <b>aircrew</b> losses in the battle were relatively low.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} a light group, the 3rd Attack Group, {{equipped}} {{with a mixture of}} Douglas A-20 Havocs and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of <b>aircrew</b> as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian <b>aircrew</b> were assigned to most of the group’s aircraft, serving in every role except aircraft commander. In addition to the RAAF <b>aircrew</b> with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area. No. 30 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942, was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the Port Moresby area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups, both equipped with Bell P-400, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.|$|E

5|$|World War II placed {{considerable}} extra {{demands on}} the RNLI, particularly in south and east England where the threat of invasion and enemy activity was ever-present, rescuing downed <b>aircrew</b> a frequent occurrence, and the constant danger of mines.

5|$|Air Combat Group {{is one of}} the Force Element Groups (FEGs) in the Air Force. It has 145 aircraft, 163 <b>aircrew</b> and 2000 support {{personnel}} based across Australia. It is {{accountable for}} all of the Air Force's F/A-18 Hornet, Super Hornet and Hawk squadrons, as well as the PC-9A Forward Air Control aircraft.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aircrew</b> {{training}} {{using the}} F-4Es began {{three days after}} the aircraft first arrived at Amberley. The aircraft were initially operated as a pool controlled by No.82 Wing (the parent headquarters for No.1 and No.6 Squadrons) and were allocated between the two squadrons only after all the Phantoms, <b>aircrew</b> and ground crew had arrived in Australia. The training program gradually increased in complexity, with night flying beginning in October, practice-bombing sorties commencing in late November and air-to-air sorties being flown from January 1971. Ground attack missions were practiced from February 1971, and in June that year the Phantoms began dropping live bombs during exercises. The introduction of several of the aircraft into service was delayed by an initial shortage of spare parts, but all were operational by the end of 1970.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971–1972 {{the unit}} helped to train C-123 <b>aircrews</b> for the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and the Wing gained control over {{close air support}} {{missions}} flown by A-37 Dragonfly <b>aircrews.</b> [...] The wing was redesignated as the 315th Tactical Airlift Wing on 1 January 1970, and remained that way until the Wing's inactivation on 31 March 1972.|$|R
