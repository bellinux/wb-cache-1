5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (<b>agents</b> <b>that</b> cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E

5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and {{atherosclerotic}} changes may begin early in life, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use bile acid sequestrants and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older children {{may be used as}} in adults.|$|E
5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|In {{charge of}} these Serbian {{military}} conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević, his right-hand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and the spy Rade Malobabić.

They also find that Fiore's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband—Charlie Morris. Anita tells the <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> Fiore hasn't returned home from the previous night; meanwhile, the agents find that pages are missing from the file on Morris' murder, and Fiore {{was the last one}} to have checked the file out.|$|E

5|$|Seizing the {{opportunity}} the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in Operation Fortitude, sending faulty intelligence to German <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> Patton {{was leading the}} Invasion of Europe. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E

5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E
5|$|Treatment was {{initially}} limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw {{the introduction of}} a number of <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and self-limiting fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a modifier to describe the immune-mediated severe form.|$|E

There are, however, many other infectious <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in the position to give it to the women.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI, Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) {{discloses}} {{to a room}} of <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> Dana Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) son William {{has been}} abducted. Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer leaves out any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals that he put a cell phone in the baby’s belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William. The two eventually find William's car seat along with the cell phone in an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William.|$|E
5|$|At the Santa Monica Pier, a magician, The Amazing Maleeni, twists {{his head}} {{completely}} around at a carnival, while Billy LaBonge, another magician, heckles Maleeni during the event. As he's leaving, his severed head falls completely off. Billy LaBonge is later questioned by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson); {{he tells the}} <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> he thought Maleeni was a ripoff. During the autopsy, Scully finds that, although Maleeni's head was cleanly cut off, {{he died of a}} heart attack. She also finds that he was dead for at least a month and refrigerated, even though the carnival manager spoke to him mere moments leading up to his head falling off.|$|E

5|$|Back from Italy {{and in the}} New York State Senate, {{he fought}} hard for the {{regulation}} of informal immigrant banks and banking <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> handled money transfers abroad, an issue of significant importance to his Italian constituency who were often swindled from their remittances to their families in Italy. Cotillo’s 1921 banking reform bill, which placed express companies and steamship agencies that transferred money abroad {{under the supervision of}} the New York State Banking Department, annoyed powerful interests of such companies as Wells Fargo and the Cunard Lines. He received death threats and offers of bribes to drop the legislation he had introduced in the Senate. During the hearings on Cotillo’s bill in March 1921, a devastating crash of the Tisbo Brothers immigrant bank in lower Manhattan left 2,000 angry depositors with losses of more than three million dollars. As a result, four bills that regulated the sector were signed into law on May 1, 1921.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor union periodicals, including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary <b>agents</b> <b>that</b> would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|E
