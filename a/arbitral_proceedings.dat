Among the institutions that have undergone these reconfigurations in the regulation of the Code of Civil Procedure, which entered into force in 2013, one that stands out is arbitration.

40|$|The {{objective}} arbitrability, which {{determines the}} range of arbitrable disputes, is set up by mandatory substantive, material rules of private international law. The comparison of different national arbitration laws shows that, mutatis mutandis, the mostly mentioned arbitrability is extended not only to pecuniary claims but also to non-pecuniary claims if parties are capable of concluding a settlement on the matter in dispute. The critical issue in international arbitration, which may arise {{at different stages of}} <b>arbitral</b> and court <b>proceedings,</b> is to determine the applicable law that governs such arbitrability. The author, upon analyses of selected national laws, case law and the New York Convention, concludes that both arbitral tribunal and national courts, have to determine objective arbitrability according to the rules of lex fori. Objektivna arbitrabilnost određuje koji se sporovi mogu podvrći arbitražnom rješavanju, utvrđena je prinudnim materijalnim pravilima međunarodnog privatnog prava. Poredba različitih nacionalnih arbitražnih prava ukazuje na to da se ta arbitrabilnost ne odnosi samo na novčane sporove već i na nenovčane ako se o njima može zaključiti nagodbu. Na osnovi analize izabranih nacionalnih prava, sudske i arbitražne prakse te Newyorške konvencije, nameće se zaključak da arbitražni i nacionalni sudovi utvrđuje objektivnu arbitrabilnost primjenom legis fori.

Ratio ovih klauzula jest dati jednoj strani prednost pri biranju načina rješavanja sporova, i to nakon što je već došlo do spora, da na taj način olakša ostvarenje svojih potraživanja prema drugoj strani. U radu se analizira njihov položaj u anglosaksonskim jurisdikcijama, kao i odabrana sudska praksa država članica EU kontinentalnog pravnog kruga, gdje se sučeljava načelo stranačke autonomije s načelom ravnopravnosti stranaka.

Optional or {{unilateral}} arbitration clauses {{give the}} option to one contractual party to choose whether to commence proceedings before a national or arbitral court after the dispute between the parties has already arisen. The party with the option is at an advantage considering that choosing the more favorable dispute resolution method enhances her chances for a successful settlement. This article focuses on the basic features of optional or unilateral arbitration clauses and their position in comparative and domestic law. It analyses American and English court practice, as well as selected German and French cases. It finds that most EU Member States have a positive attitude towards optional arbitration clauses. The author emphasizes the position of German courts which invalidate these clauses if a party with the option wishes to utilize it after the other party has already commenced <b>arbitral</b> or judicial <b>proceedings.</b> Conversely, the author advocates {{the view that the}} Croatian courts should give advantage to party autonomy, where it recommends that parties provide for a special procedure when constructing optional arbitration clauses. This procedure should provide for communication between the parties before any proceedings are commenced in order to avoid parallel proceedings. Also, this article finds that, although optional arbitration clauses are rare in the field of capital markets, the Croatian legislature has provided for obligatory use of this type of clauses for disputes between management companies and investors of UCITS funds. Finally, {{in spite of the fact}} that there have been no cases before the Croatian courts regarding the validity of optional arbitration clauses, the author is of the opinion that the Croatian courts would take a positive attitude towards these clauses...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{challenges}} encountered by parties seeking to have arbitral awards recognised and enforced within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Specifically, this thesis critically assesses {{the impact of}} Shariah on the enforcement of international awards within the Kingdom and aims to suggest actionable reforms to further develop the Saudi arbitration framework, and build on the modernisation efforts initiated through the Saudi Arbitration Law and Enforcement Law, both issued in 2012. This study aims to examine issues around the treatment and enforcement of domestic and international awards under the Saudi legal system and dispute settlement machinery. Particular focus will be directed to {{the differences between the}} enforcement of domestic and foreign awards, and the challenges that arise therein. By way of critical analysis, this thesis explores the history and development of arbitration law and procedure in Saudi Arabia, focusing on the role of Shariah principles in contract construction and dispute resolution. By bringing Saudi arbitration procedures into greater alignment with international standards and practices, and curtailing the power of local courts, the New Arbitration Law has been widely welcomed as establishing a more hospitable arbitration environment for commercial actors, foreign and domestic. While the New Saudi Arbitration Regime aimed to bring much-needed certainty and predictability to Saudi-based commercial arbitration awards, the Saudi legal system {{is still in its infancy}} and struggling to balance its Shariah roots with secular practices. As this thesis explores, the Saudi model of contract construction and dispute resolution is not yet embedded in a settled or ‘gapless’ body of legal principles, in large part because of on-going contestation among Islamic scholars over the scope and meaning of Shariah principles. While the new law significantly curtails the review power of local courts, judicial authorities in Saudi Arabia continue to enjoy broad discretion to reopen a final non-localised arbitral award issued elsewhere and to subject it to review on the merits. The grounds for annulment, revision or refusal to enforce include any agreement deemed to contravene Shariah law, Saudi public policy and prior Saudi court decrees, in addition to other public policy related defences. In the final analysis, the proposed thesis will consider the potential impacts of Shariah on <b>arbitral</b> award enforcement <b>proceedings</b> initiated in Saudi Arabia. At the level of conceptual analysis, the proposed research reflects on the familiar tension between international regulations, which is principally achieved through harmonisation of applicable arbitral procedures and the domestic enforcement of applicable national (substantive) laws on arbitration. From these premises, the proposed thesis will critically evaluate the extent to which Saudi arbitration law has reconciled the modernising ambitions of an ‘commerce friendly’ arbitration regime and where progress is still needed to achieve efficient and effective award enforcement...|$|R

50|$|What {{follows is}} a very summary {{description}} {{of the content of}} the Limitation Convention, provided for preliminary information only. Readers are encouraged to refer to the explanatory note to that convention prepared by the UNCITRAL secretariat for further introductory information on the Limitation Convention. In its original unamended version, the Limitation Convention applies when both parties have their place of business in contracting States (Article 3(1)). In the amended version, the Limitation Convention applies also when rules of private international law make the law of a Contracting State applicable to the contract of sale (Article 3(1)(b)). Hence, the Limitation Convention, as amended, applies in the same case as the CISG. It {{should be noted that the}} reference is to the rules of private international law applicable to the contract itself, and not to limitation matters. Likewise, other matters relating to scope of application of the Convention, especially in its amended form, are treated similarly as in the CISG. However, article 5 of the Limitation Convention contains an additional list of excluded matters that is not present in the CISG.The limitation period is four years, starting from the date when the claim accrues (Articles 8 and 9). The limitation period stops to run when judicial or <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> are commenced (Articles 13 and 14).|$|E
5000|$|The {{first and}} {{foremost}} welcome amendment introduced by the ordinance is with respect to definition of expression 'Court'. The amended law makes {{a clear distinction between}} an international commercial arbitration and domestic arbitration with regard to the definition of 'Court'. In so far as domestic arbitration is concerned, the definition of [...] "Court" [...] is the same as was in the 1996 Act, however, for the purpose of international commercial arbitration, 'Court' has been defined to mean only High Court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, in an international commercial arbitration, as per the new law, district court will have no jurisdiction and the parties can expect speedier and efficacious determination of any issue directly by the High court which is better equipped in terms of handling commercial disputes.Amendment of Section 2(2): A proviso to Section 2(2) has been added which envisages that subject to the agreement to the contrary, Section 9 (interim measures), Section 27(taking of evidence), and Section 37(1)(a), 37(3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitrations, even if the seat of arbitration is outside India, meaning thereby that the new law has tried to strike a kind of balance between the situations created by the judgments of Bhatia International and Balco v. Kaiser. Now Section 2(2) envisages that Part-I shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India and that provisions of Sections 9, 27, 37(1) (a) and 37 (3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitration even if the seat of arbitration is outside India unless parties to the arbitration agreement have agreed to the contrary.Amendment to Section 8: (Reference of parties to the dispute to arbitration): In Section 8, which mandates any judicial authority to refer the parties to arbitration in respect of an action brought before it, which is subject matter of arbitration agreement [...] The sub-section(1) has been amended envisaging that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any court, the judicial authority shall refer the parties to the arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. A provision has also been made enabling the party, who applies for reference of the matter to arbitration, to apply to the Court for a direction of production of the arbitration agreement or certified copy thereof in the event the parties applying for reference of the disputes to arbitration is not in the possession of the arbitration agreement and the opposite party has the same.Amendment to Section 9 (Interim Measures): The amended section envisages that if the Court passes an interim measure of protection under the section before commencement of <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings,</b> then the <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> shall have to commence within a period of 90 days from the date of such order or within such time as the Court may determine.

40|$|The role of {{arbitration}} in settling disputes {{which involves}} national and transnational commercial transactions is steadily growing {{in this era}} of globalisation.

40|$|Confidentiality is {{unanimously}} recognized {{to be one}} of {{the most}} characteristic and attractive features of international commercial arbitration. The confidential character of <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> has often been presumed on the basis of the privacy of the hearings, but this presumption has proven ill-founded in arbitrations between private and public actors ("mixed arbitration"). National courts and international tribunals have come to recognize and to enforce a public interest exception to confidentiality based on the principle that the public has a right to be informed of the contents and outcome of the <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> whenever the subject-matter of the dispute is of public concern. This thesis will assess the basis upon which and the limits within which the public interest exception to confidentiality might operate.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the judiciary and arbitration must be based upon integration and cooperation and not upon competition and tension. From this point, the competent court must play the vital role of supporting and assisting the arbitration process during its various stages. To the extent that this relation is successful and harmonized, arbitration will be effective in resolving disputes within the shortest time and at the least expense. Judicial involvement in <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> occurs during several stages of arbitration. This involvement starts with the competent court‟s decision to abstain from considering a case involving a dispute over an agreement that includes an arbitration clause. Court instead intervenes to enforce the arbitration agreement, supervising {{the selection of the}} arbitral tribunal and assisting in that process whenever the need arises. Thereafter, the court monitors the course of the <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> by considering claims for the arbitrators' challenge and dismissal and, if such claims are successful, filling the resulting vacancy. Court Intervention extends to include an important and critical stage of the <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings,</b> which is the stage of pleading before the competent court. Whereas the competent court enjoys the power to enforce judicial decisions, the arbitral tribunal does not have such power. In this context, judicial assistance is indispensable to the arbitral tribunal, for example, in resolving a preliminary point, issuing a subpoena to a witness who refuses to appear before the tribunal, consolidating <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings,</b> ordering an uncooperative party to provide documents related to the dispute, rendering interim and conservatory measures, and extending the time limit for rendering the arbitration award. In considering the significance of the court's assistance of and support for arbitration at the procedural stage, the importance and contribution of this study is in its exploration of the pivots and patterns of the expected judicial review and assistance based upon both the provisions and rules of arbitration and judicial precedents. Interviews conducted with senior judges, arbitrators and chiefs of international arbitration centres provide a rich tributary that enhances this study and supports it with vast and vital experience and with fresh information that cannot be found in any previous scientific research of this topic. In short, this study focuses upon the conception of the judicial involvement in supporting <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings</b> inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and upon evaluating this involvement in comparison with the involvement of the judiciary {{in the rest of the}} GCC states and international applications in this regard. Moreover, the study offers proposals and recommendations to the Saudi legislator in particular and to the Gulf legislator in general, and draws a model framework for the {{relationship between}} the judiciary and arbitration during the proceedings stage.

Confidentiality {{has been}} {{regarded}} as an essential attribute of arbitration over litigation due to its “private and confidential” nature in <b>arbitral</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Such attribute of arbitration has been subject to debates over recent years from different scholars {{in the world of}} arbitration. Two common law jurisdictions have been the result of such debates. The United Kingdom (England) who has for decades assumed the existence of an implied obligation of confidentiality in its arbitration proceedings while Australia has rejected such an implied obligation and have held that confidentiality is not an essential attribute of arbitration.
