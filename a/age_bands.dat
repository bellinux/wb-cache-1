2500|$|In 2008, Pullman led a {{campaign}} against the introduction of <b>age</b> <b>bands</b> {{on the covers of}} children’s books, saying: [...] "It's based on a one-dimensional view of growth, which regards growing older as moving along a line like a monkey climbing a stick: now you're seven, so you read these books; and now you're nine so you read these". More than 1,200 authors, booksellers, illustrators, librarians and teachers joined the campaign; Pullman’s own publisher, Scholastic agreed to his request not to put the <b>age</b> <b>bands</b> on his book covers. Joel Rickett, deputy editor of The Bookseller, said: [...] "The steps taken by Mr Pullman and other authors have taken the industry by surprise and I think these proposals are now in the balance".|$|E

Girls cannot play adult rugby until they have passed their 18th birthday. From 2010/11 most clubs joined a national league structure introduced by the RFUW. These largely replaced the knock-out National Cups for U15 and U18 teams.|$|E

40|$|Does the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC) {{measures}} what {{it claims}} to measure? The concurrent {{validity of the}} total impairment score {{and some of the}} item scores of the second and third <b>age</b> <b>band</b> of the M-ABC test were investigated. One hundred thirty three children, between 7 - and 9 -year-old, were assessed with the M-ABC test, a ball catching test and two tasks measuring dynamic balance. Ninety of these children were identified as children with a poor ball catching skill and 43 children were typically developing children. One hundred and seven children were assessed with the second <b>age</b> <b>band</b> of the M-ABC (the 7 - and 8 -year-old children) and 26 with the third <b>age</b> <b>band</b> (the 9 -year-old children). The results of the correlation analysis between the ball catching test, the two dynamic balance tasks and the corresponding items of the M-ABC, varied from non-significant to a highly significant correlation coefficient of - 0. 74. For some items concurrent validity was established but other items seemed less valid, probably {{due to a lack of}} discriminative power. The concurrent validity of the total impairment score of the M-ABC was confirmed for the second <b>age</b> <b>band.</b> Correlation coefficients between the ball catching test, the dynamic balance skills and the M-ABC varied between - 0. 72 and - 0. 76. The results for the third <b>age</b> <b>band</b> have to be interpreted with prudence because they were based on only 26 children. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|To {{get a more}} {{informative}} {{comparison between}} the two populations, a weighting approach is used. Older groups in the Indigenous population are weighted more heavily (to match their prevalence in the [...] "reference population", i.e. the overall Australian population) and younger groups less heavily. This gives an [...] "age-adjusted" [...] morbidity rate approximately 30% higher than that for the general population, indicating that Indigenous Australians have {{a higher risk of}} circulatory disease. (Note that some residual distortion remains due to the wide <b>age</b> <b>bands</b> being used.) This is directly analogous to the standardized mortality ratio for mortality statistics.|$|E
