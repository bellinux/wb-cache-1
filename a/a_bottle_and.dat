5|$|Despite these challenges, {{the huge}} {{quantities}} of gold coming through Dawson City encouraged a lavish lifestyle amongst the richer prospectors. Saloons were typically open 24 hours a day, with whiskey the standard drink. Gambling was popular, {{with the major}} saloons each running their own rooms; a culture of high stakes evolved, with rich prospectors routinely betting $1,000 ($27,000) at dice or playing for a $5,000 ($140,000) poker pot. The establishments around Front Street had grand facades in a Parisian style, mirrors and plate-glass windows and, from late 1898, were lit by electric light. The dance halls in Dawson were particularly prestigious and major status symbols, both for customers and their owners. Wealthy prospectors were expected to drink champagne at $60 ($1,600) <b>a</b> <b>bottle,</b> <b>and</b> the Pavilion dancehall cost its owner, Charlie Kimball, as much as $100,000 ($80 million) to construct and decorate. Elaborate opera houses were built, bringing singers and specialty acts to Dawson.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to restrictive behavior, parents {{are advised to}} provide daily sessions in which older children are treated {{as if they were}} babies to create attachment. The child is held in the caregiver's lap, rocked, hugged and kissed, and fed with <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> given sweets. These sessions are carried out at the caregiver's wish and not upon the child's request. Attachment therapists believe that reenactments of aspects of infant care have the power to rebuild damaged aspects of early development such as emotional attachment.|$|E

25|$|The film {{opens in}} modern Stockholm. Orphaned by his mother's death and father's disappearance, Bosse (Nicholas Pickard) suffers neglect by his guardians Aunt Edna (Gunilla Nyroos) and Uncle Sixten, {{as well as}} abuse from bullies. His best friend is Benke (Christian Bale), whose father Bosse envies. Running away one night to seek his own father, Bosse meets the kindly shopkeeper Mrs Lundin (Linn Stokke), who gives him an apple and asks him to mail a {{postcard}}. The postcard is addressed to the Land of Faraway, informing its King of Bosse's impending journey there. After Bosse mails the postcard, his apple turns golden. Dropping the transfigured apple in shock, Bosse stumbles upon a genie (Geoffrey Staines) trapped in <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> frees it.|$|E

The owner, who is treated as the polong's parent, must feed the spirit daily with blood from their neck. A {{person who has been}} afflicted by the polong will cry out and wildly strike at people nearby, all the while blind and deaf to their surroundings, and unconscious of what they are doing. In such cases, a bomoh would be called into question the polong and find out who is its parent and where they are located. If the polong lies or conceals the identity of its owner, the victim will die after one or two days.|$|E
25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used forming machine arrangement is the individual section machine (or IS machine). This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the gobs feed into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the blank moulds in parallel.|$|E

25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The happenings or adventures {{all take}} place at the fictional St Denis Bay, {{inspired}} by Minnis Bay at Birchington-on-Sea, which setting may be partly informed by Scott's residence nearby at Herne Bay. The map of St Denis Bay on the book's endpapers, possibly by Scott himself, shows similarity to Minnis Bay along the beach, but the town is imaginary. The stories start with a message in <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> end with a haunted sea front. It was published in French in 1963 by Rouge et Or Dauphine as Les Cherry au Bord de la Mer, illustrated by Pierre Le Guen. In 1970 it was published by Estudios Cor in Portuguese as Uma aventura na praia (A Familia Cherry). Happenings: The message in the bottle; The watch on the coast (coastguarding); On the trail of the Oozlum (reference to Oozlum bird, description of wanted man and manhunt, coastguarding); Alone on a desert isle (shipwreck and rescue); Follow my leader (how the Cherrys met the Pringles, inspired by the Woozle story by A. A. Milne, i.e. people tracking each other in a circuit); Look out for Smiths! (avoiding an imaginary fifth column made up of people called Smith); The slap-dash carnival (probably inspired by the 1950s Herne Bay Carnival; story includes hostile characters typical of contemporary children's comic strip tales); This way or that? (cipher); Seaside Christmas (children fund purchase of their dinghy, the Sandman); The haunted sea front (red herrings).|$|E

500|$|Kennedy's {{personal}} life came to dominate his image. In 1989 paparazzi stalked {{him on a}} vacation in Europe and photographed him having sex on a motorboat. In February 1990, Michael Kelly published his long, thorough profile [...] "Ted Kennedy on the Rocks" [...] in GQ magazine. It captured Kennedy as [...] "an aging Irish boyo clutching <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> diddling a blonde," [...] portrayed him as an out-of-control Regency rake, and brought his behavior {{to the forefront of}} public attention. The death from cancer of brother-in-law Stephen Edward Smith in August 1990 left Kennedy emotionally bereft at the loss of a close family member and troubleshooter. Kennedy pushed on, but even his legislative successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which expanded employee rights in discrimination cases, came at the cost of being criticized for compromising with Republicans and Southern Democrats.|$|E

He is also learning Yoga techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into <b>a</b> <b>bottle,</b> <b>and</b> is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a SWAT team, led by Russian-born British Royal Marine Emil Blonsky, to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected {{with a small amount}} of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.|$|E
500|$|In 1873 W.J. Maxwell and H.G.

In two expeditions carried out in 1873 and 1874, they penetrated [...] into the grotto before finding their progress blocked by an underground waterfall. The waterfall became known as [...] "Hell's Rapids", as the torrents break onto razor sharp rocks. Dr. Bliss, Mr. Maxwell and the other engineers recorded their names and the year on [...] "Maxwell's Column", a great limestone pillar some [...] from the entrance. About [...] further on, in the so-called [...] "Pantheon", they wrote their names and details of the expedition on paper, sealed it in <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> placed {{it on top of}} a stalagmite. The lime-impregnated water has since covered the bottle with a thin white film, permanently fixing it to the stone.|$|E

On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced <b>a</b> <b>bottle,</b> <b>and</b> Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating [...] "I need all the strength for the occasion I can have."
