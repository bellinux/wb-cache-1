5000|$|Though <b>a</b> wood <b>bat</b> {{is legal}} in NCAA competition, players {{overwhelmingly}} prefer and use <b>a</b> metal <b>bat.</b> The metal bat was implemented in college baseball in 1975. Use of <b>a</b> metal <b>bat</b> is somewhat controversial. Supporters of an aluminum or composite bat {{note that it}} can increase offensive performance, as {{the speed of a}} ball off <b>a</b> metal <b>bat</b> is generally faster than off <b>a</b> wood <b>bat.</b> Those against metal, and for wood, argue that <b>a</b> metal <b>bat</b> is not safe to use, and that <b>a</b> metal <b>bat</b> doesn't prepare players for the next level, as professional baseball uses <b>a</b> wood <b>bat</b> exclusively. In the 2011 season the NCAA changed the requirements for <b>a</b> metal <b>bat,</b> reducing the maximum allowed exit speed {{in a way that is}} said to produce a feeling more like <b>a</b> wood <b>bat.</b> <b>As</b> a result, in 2011 there was a drop-off in overall [...] "long" [...] drives or home runs relative to past years.|$|R

5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team {{attempts}} to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with <b>a</b> <b>bat</b> swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, <b>a</b> <b>batted</b> ball is {{any ball}} that, after a pitch, is {{contacted}} by the batter's bat. One or more of several terms are used to describe <b>a</b> <b>batted</b> ball, depending on how it comes off the bat and where in the field it lands.|$|R
5|$|In early cricket, {{there were}} two umpires as now, but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket. Both umpires carried <b>a</b> <b>bat</b> which the running batsman was {{required}} to touch in order to complete his run. There were two scorers who sat {{on the field and}} recorded the scores by making notches on tallysticks; runs were then known as notches for this reason.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds <b>a</b> <b>bat</b> it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E
5|$|Little brown bats produce {{calls that}} are high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 calls per second when in flight. When pursuing prey, <b>a</b> <b>bat</b> emits 200 calls per second. It also emits a high-pulse repetitive call {{if it wants to}} land.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus griveaudi is <b>a</b> <b>bat</b> in {{the genus}} Miniopterus found on Grande Comore and Anjouan in the Comoros and in {{northern}} and western Madagascar. First described in 1959 from Grande Comore as a subspecies {{of the mainland}} African M.minor, it was later placed with the Malagasy M.manavi. However, morphological and molecular studies published in 2008 and 2009 indicated that M.manavi as then defined contained five distinct, unrelated species, and M.griveaudi was redefined as a species occurring on both Madagascar and the Comoros.|$|E

Populations of this species have {{historically}} been included in Miniopterus manavi, but molecular data published in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this supposed species in fact consists of five separate species, including the newly described M.mahafaliensis.

5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi long-fingered bat) is <b>a</b> <b>bat</b> in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} east-central Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1906, this species was later included in the mainland African M.minor. A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M.manavi in fact included five different species. M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species.|$|E
