5|$|McCay's brother Arthur {{was placed}} in a mental {{hospital}} in Traverse City, Michigan on March 7, 1898, where he stayed until his death from bronchopneumonia and <b>arteriosclerosis</b> on June 15, 1946. He never received family visits. McCay never let his children know about his brother, nor did they know about the existence of his sister Mae, who died in 1910.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Coward {{suffered}} from <b>arteriosclerosis</b> and, during the run of Suite in Three Keys, he struggled with bouts of memory loss. This also affected his work in The Italian Job, and he retired from acting immediately afterwards. Coward was knighted in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement. In 1972, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the University of Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Ford died on December 26, 2006, at {{his home}} in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic {{cerebrovascular}} disease and diffuse <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves. He was 93. Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6:00p.m. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely {{cause of death was}} <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser was a heavy smoker with a family history of heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary <b>Arteriosclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took {{time off for}} vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s {{and by the time}} of his death in 1970, he also had <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following <b>arteriosclerosis</b> of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|White never {{remarried}} {{following his}} wife's death in 1915. In addition to White's church activities, {{he served as}} a master of the Masonic Lodge, and was affiliated with the Odd Fellows. Beginning in 1934, White endured 18 months of illness, and on August 14, 1935, his physician Dr. R. W. Dailey reported to the Cumberland Evening Times that he was in critical condition and was unlikely to recover. White succumbed to his illness and died at his residence in Romney on August 15, 1935 at the age of 59 as a result of <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> Myocarditis also contributed to his prolonged illness but was not the cause of his death. White was interred with Masonic rites on Saturday afternoon, August 17, 1935 at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. A number of state officials attended his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{personality}} cult {{was growing}} outrageously {{at a time}} when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he was a lifelong heavy smoker, he had become addicted to sleeping pills, and had begun drinking to excess. Over the years he had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, Brezhnev's central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials knew for several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe <b>arteriosclerosis</b> and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977 American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. Yevgeniy Chazov, the Chief of the Fourth Directorate of the Ministry of Health, had to keep doctors by Brezhnev's side at all times, and Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive, even if such men as Mikhail Suslov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Andrei Gromyko, among others, were growing increasingly frustrated with his policies. They did not want to risk a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death. At about this time First World commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|These {{factors are}} protein-calorie malnutrition, {{microclimate}} (skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence), diseases that reduce {{blood flow to}} the skin, such as <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> or diseases that reduce the sensation in the skin, such as paralysis or neuropathy. The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person, medical conditions (such as <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> diabetes or infection), smoking or medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
25|$|Bressey died at {{a nursing}} home in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire on 14 April 1951 from a {{cerebral}} haemorrhage and <b>arteriosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{atheroma}} is {{an accumulation}} of degenerative material in the inner layer of an artery wall. The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue. The accumulated material forms a swelling in the artery wall, which may intrude into the channel of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. Atheroma occurs in atherosclerosis, {{which is one of}} the three subtypes of <b>arteriosclerosis</b> (which are atherosclerosis, Monckeberg's <b>arteriosclerosis</b> and arteriolosclerosis).|$|E
25|$|In {{his last}} years Clark {{suffered}} from <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> He {{died at the}} age of seventy-nine in a nursing home in Hythe, Kent, after a fall.|$|E
25|$|CABG {{is often}} {{indicated}} when coronary arteries have a 50 percent to 99 percent obstruction. The obstruction being bypassed is typically due to <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> atherosclerosis, or both. <b>Arteriosclerosis</b> {{is characterized by}} thickening, loss of elasticity, and calcification of the arterial wall, most often resulting in a generalized narrowing in the affected coronary artery. Atherosclerosis is characterized by yellowish plaques of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris deposited into the inner layer of {{the wall of a}} large or medium-sized coronary artery, most often resulting in a focal partial obstruction in the affected artery. Either condition can limit blood flow if it causes a cross-sectional narrowing of at least 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Evatt was {{suffering}} from stress and was persuaded to retire from the bench. He also suffered from <b>arteriosclerosis</b> which led to his death. He died in Canberra on 2 November 1965, aged 71.|$|E
25|$|Oligomeric procyanidins {{have been}} {{proposed}} to offer protection to human vascular cells, with other research indicating that red wine polyphenols reduce absorption of malondialdehyde which is implicated in elevating levels of low-density lipoprotein in the onset of <b>arteriosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the death of his wife (the former Della Thompson) in 1951, Head entered a nursing home due to Parkinson's disease and <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> He died of {{pneumonia}} at Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, on May 3, 1954 and was survived by one daughter.|$|E
25|$|Grant died in Salt Lake City, Utah, from cardiac {{failure as}} a result of <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> As the final {{surviving}} member of the church's Council of Fifty, his death marked the formal end of the organization. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Hartnell's deteriorating health (he {{suffered}} from <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> which began to affect {{his ability to}} learn his lines), as well as poor relations with a new production team on the series following the departure of Verity Lambert, ultimately led to him leaving Doctor Who in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{found no}} {{evidence}} of mechanical failure or defect. Some days after the crash, it was learned that the pilot, Reed Pigman, who also happened to be the president of American Flyers, was under care for <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> An autopsy of Pigman determined his cause of death to either be multiple injuries or coronary artery sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{are held}} {{together}} by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a tissue, the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures {{that are part of}} the body, but not within a cell. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 February 2012, Jones went to tend his {{fourteen}} horses at a farm in Indiantown, Florida. After riding one of his favourite horses around the track, he complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing and was rushed to Martin Memorial South Hospital in Stuart, Florida, where he was pronounced dead of a severe heart attack resulting from <b>arteriosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{apparently}} contracted chronic malaria {{while in}} Nicaragua in 1870 and 1871 on the surveying expedition. Repeated bouts of malaria took {{a toll on}} his health, which became poor enough in 1904 {{to force him to}} relinquish command of the Asiatic Fleet and retire. He returned to the United States but never completely recovered, and died at Morristown, New Jersey, on 29 December 1912 of interstitial myocarditis and general <b>arteriosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Exhausted {{from the}} {{rigorous}} cross-examination questioning and ill, Dyer was then released. Over {{the next several}} months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, {{as well as many}} MPs, turned hostile towards Dyer as the extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known. Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer, seriously ill with jaundice and <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> was hospitalised.|$|E
25|$|As she aged, Xin Zhui {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} ailments that would eventually led to her death. Alongside a number of internal parasites, she also had coronary thrombosis and <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> most likely linked to excessive weight gained due to a sedentary lifestyle. A fused spinal disc probably caused her immense pain, which contributed to a decrease in physical activity. She also {{suffered from}} gallstones, one of which lodged in her bile duct and further deteriorated her condition.|$|E
25|$|After the Italian leader Benito Mussolini {{introduced}} anti-Semitic laws in Italy, Albert invited Maja {{to emigrate}} to the United States in 1939 {{and live in}} his residence in Mercer Street, Princeton, New Jersey. Her husband was denied entry into the United States on health grounds. Maja spent some pleasant years with Albert, until she suffered a stroke in 1946, and became bedridden. She later developed progressive <b>arteriosclerosis,</b> and died in Princeton on 25 June 1951 four years before her brother.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson–Gilford {{progeria}} {{syndrome is}} an extremely rare developmental autosomal dominant condition, characterized by premature and accelerated aging (~7 times the normal rate) beginning at childhood. It affects 1 in ~4 million newborns; over 130 cases {{have been reported in}} the literature since the first described case in 1886. The mean age of diagnosis is ~3 years and the mean age of death is ~13 years. The cause of death is usually myocardial infarction, caused by the severe hardening of the arteries (<b>arteriosclerosis).</b> There is currently no treatment available.|$|E
25|$|Lane was a {{chronically ill}} person in 1917, {{suffering}} from Bright's disease or advanced <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> His precarious condition was further {{undermined by the}} intense barrage of public criticism {{to which he was}} subjected. Nevertheless, on April 4, 1917, against the advice of doctors, Lane {{made his way to the}} Senate floor to vote against the Declaration of War against Germany which had been the product of an April 2 speech by the President. Joining Lane in opposition were just 5 other Senators: Robert LaFollette, William J. Stone, James Vardaman, Asle Gronna, and George W. Norris.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, he found himself {{essentially}} trapped in Vichy France, while his son, Prince Philip, fought {{on the side of}} the British. They were unable to see or even correspond with one another. Two of Andrew's surviving sons-in-law fought on the German side. Prince Christoph of Hesse was a member of the Nazi Party and the Waffen-SS. Berthold, Margrave of Baden, was invalided out of the Wehrmacht in 1940 after an injury in France. For five years, Andrew saw neither his wife nor his son. He died in the Hotel Metropole, Monte-Carlo, Monaco of heart failure and <b>arteriosclerosis</b> just as the war was ending.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Knox {{remarried}} {{to a woman}} name Maka Harper. He and his {{new wife}} took a short honeymoon, and during this time he resigned from Ellis Island. He moved back to Ashtabula, Ohio, where he had lived {{until the age of}} nine. He lived here for a short time and then moved to Skillman, New Jersey to take a position as the clinical director in the New Jersey State Village for Epileptics. He worked here for five months, after which he opened a private practice in Hudson City, New Jersey. In 1922, he and his family moved to North Hampton, New Hampshire, where he lived until he died of <b>arteriosclerosis</b> in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{individuals}} can exhibit growth retardation, short stature, premature graying of hair, hair loss, wrinkling, prematurely aged faces, beaked noses, skin atrophy (wasting away) with scleroderma-like lesions, {{loss of fat}} tissues, abnormal fat deposition leading to thin legs and arms, and severe ulcerations around the Achilles tendon and malleoli. Other signs include change in voice, making it weak, hoarse, or high-pitched; atrophy of gonads, leading to reduced fertility; bilateral cataracts (clouding of lens); premature <b>arteriosclerosis</b> (thickening and loss of elasticity of arteries); calcinosis (calcium deposits in blood vessels); atherosclerosis (blockage of blood vessels); type 2 diabetes; loss of bone mass; telangiectasia; and malignancies. In fact, the prevalence of rare cancers, such as meningiomas, are increased in individuals with Werner syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Larramendi, {{at that time}} almost 70, {{acquired}} the status of Carlist moral authority if not a movement's patriarch. He was aging quickly; in the 1950s he suffered heavily from <b>arteriosclerosis</b> and loss of sight, gradually turning almost blind. Nevertheless, he remained engaged in internal politics and counted among those who advocated termination of the regency, to be replaced with personal claim of Don Javier. In 1952 he presided over the Consejo Nacional de la Tradición meeting, discussing {{how it should be}} advanced; due to health reasons he did not attend the , where Don Javier was effectively introduced as a king. In 1955 Larramendi met his monarch for the last time. When in the mid-1950s the intransigent Carlist opposition to Franco came under fire as inefficient and counter-productive, Larramendi kept protesting a would-be rapprochement. Some scholars claim that in 1956 he was nominated to a new Carlist executive, Secretariado General; this is not impossible, as at that time Larramendi was sort of a Carlist living saint; however. others point rather to his son, Ignacio.|$|E
500|$|He died on 23 March 1958 in Champaign, Illinois. The {{cause of}} death was <b>arteriosclerosis.</b> His funeral took place on 26 March, and he was buried at Roselawn Champaign Cemetery [...]|$|E
500|$|Rockefeller died of <b>arteriosclerosis</b> on May 23, 1937, {{less than}} two months shy of his 98th birthday, at [...] "The Casements", his home in Ormond Beach, Florida. He was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.|$|E
500|$|The {{stress of}} the war had taken its toll on the King's health, made worse by his heavy smoking and {{subsequent}} development of lung cancer among other ailments, including <b>arteriosclerosis</b> and Buerger's disease. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened {{the loss of the}} leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949.|$|E
