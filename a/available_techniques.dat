5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using <b>available</b> <b>techniques.</b> It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E

25|$|The women labourers were {{surprisingly}} {{important to}} the canal's engineering. Many came from former Roman bath colonies in the Pyrenees, where elements of classical hydraulics had been maintained as a living tradition. They were employed at first to move earth to the dam at Saint Ferréol, but their supervisors, who were struggling to design the channels from the dam to the canal, recognized their expertise. Engineering in this period was mainly focused on fortress construction, and hydraulics was concerned mostly with mining and problems of drainage. Building a navigational canal across the continent was well beyond the formal knowledge of the military engineers expected to supervise it, but the peasant women who were carriers of classical hydraulic methods added to the repertoire of <b>available</b> <b>techniques.</b> They not only perfected the water supply system for the canal but also threaded the waterway through the mountains near Béziers, using few locks, and built the eight-lock staircase at Fonserannes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{prevention}} [...] [...] [...] can perhaps better {{be considered an}} overarching aim that {{gives rise to a}} multitude of legal mechanisms, including prior assessment of environmental harm, licensing or authorization that set out the conditions for operation and the consequences for violation of the conditions, as well as the adoption of strategies and policies.

2500|$|Before the A-12, {{titanium}} {{was used}} only in high-temperature exhaust fairings {{and other small}} parts directly related to supporting, cooling, or shaping high-temperature areas on aircraft like those subject to the greatest kinetic heating from the airstream, such as wing leading edges. The A-12, however, was constructed mainly of titanium. Titanium is quite rigid and difficult to machine, which {{made it difficult to}} form into curves given <b>available</b> <b>techniques.</b> This made the construction of the leading edges of the wing and similar surfaces difficult to form. The solution was found by machining only small [...] "fillets" [...] of the material with the required shape and then glueing them onto the underlying framework which was more linear. A good example is on the wing; the underlying framework of spars and stringers formed a grid, leaving triangular notches along the leading edge that were filled with fillets.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his appeal}} was denied in 1980, Hakamada {{obtained}} {{a new team}} of lawyers. In 1981, they filed {{a request for a}} retrial, asking for the physical evidence to be re-examined. In the investigation, it was determined the alleged murder weapon was the wrong size to produce the stab wounds, that a door supposedly used to enter the home was actually locked, and that the bloody pants were too small to have been worn by Hakamada. Backed by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA), Hakamada's lawyers concluded the first trial had failed to establish that any of the clothing belonged to him. After 13 years of gathering evidence, the request was heard and denied by the Shizuoka District Court on August 9, 1994.

2500|$|In that lecture, Rutherford conjectured the {{existence}} of new particles. [...] The alpha particle {{was known to be}} very stable, and it was assumed to retain its identity within the nucleus. [...] The alpha particle was presumed to consist of four protons and two closely bound electrons to give it +2 charge. [...] In a 1919 paper, Rutherford had reported the apparent discovery of a new doubly charged particle of mass 3, denoted the X++, interpreted to consist of three protons and a closely bound electron. [...] This result suggested to Rutherford the likely existence of two new particles, one of two protons with a closely bound electron, and another of one proton and a closely bound electron. [...] The X++ particle was later determined to have mass 4 and to be just a low-energy alpha particle. Nevertheless, Rutherford had conjectured {{the existence}} of the neutron, a neutral particle of mass 1, and the deuteron, a +1 charge particle of mass 2. [...] The latter is the nucleus of deuterium, discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey. The mass of the hypothetical neutral particle would be little {{different from that of the}} proton. Rutherford determined that such a zero-charge particle would be difficult to detect by <b>available</b> <b>techniques.</b>|$|E
