5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border <b>adjustments</b> (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border <b>adjustments</b> work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries.

40|$|Abstract: For laser systems, the <b>adjustment</b> of {{the optical}} axes is crucial.

In order to solve these problems, we propose a robust and efficient automatic <b>adjustment</b> method for the optical axes of laser systems using a binary search algorithm. <b>Adjustment</b> experiments for optical axes with 4 -DOF demonstrate that the <b>adjustment</b> time could be reduced to half the conventional <b>adjustment</b> time with the genetic algorithm. <b>Adjustment</b> precision was enhanced by 60 %...|$|R

The sample included 177 undergraduate students, ages 18 - 25, attending Wayne State University, who completed on-line questionnaires. Race and cumulative college GPA were related to academic <b>adjustment.</b> Being Arabic/Middle-Eastern was a consistent predictor of college <b>adjustment.</b> It was found that higher college GPA and being White was related to higher academic <b>adjustment,</b> while being Arabic/Middle-Eastern was related to lower academic <b>adjustment.</b> College GPA was the only personal/demographic variable predicting social <b>adjustment.</b> A positive relationship {{was found between the}} self-reported social class and the personal-emotional <b>adjustment.</b> Being Arabic/Middle-Eastern, first generation college student, or on-campus living, were related to a lower sense of attachment to the institution, while higher college GPA was related to higher levels of attachment.
