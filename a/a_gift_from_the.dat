5|$|A last-minute gift of £4,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell {{still left}} the {{expedition}} {{far short of}} the required £30,000, but enabled Nimrods refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further £5,000 was provided as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Government of Australia, and the New Zealand Government gave £1,000. By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the £30,000 was raised, although {{by the end of the}} expedition total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to £45,000.|$|E

He showed his intent to conquer {{the entirety of the}} Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{followed}} up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons {{with up to}} 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of {{a few drops of}} heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of Helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons).|$|E

5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5|$|Two huge murals by Brazilian artist Cândido Portinari, {{entitled}} Guerra e Paz (War and Peace) {{are located}} at the delegates hall.

5|$|Columbus is a {{historic}} statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States on Elmwood Avenue in Columbus Square. Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, {{but rather as a}} demonstration of the skills of the Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. It stands upon a granite base {{at the center of a}} grassy triangle at the intersection of Reservoir Avenue and Elmwood Avenue.

5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Wright {{was elected}} to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but {{with support from the}} small Greenback movement. In 1878, the {{situation}} was reversed: Wright ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend the Homestead Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by the homestead, not <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, Wright, like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.|$|E

5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche {{presented himself}} before it {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to judge him, and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that saved his life and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the inalienable right of conquest, and retained them henceforth as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had any immediate descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{library was}} founded with the United Nations in 1946. It was {{originally}} called the United Nations Library, later the United Nations International Library.

The Dag Hammarskjöld Library was dedicated and renamed on November 16, 1961.

5|$|There {{are many}} myths {{regarding}} {{the construction of}} the Faidherbe Bridge which are present even today and are depicted in some tourist guides.

Other sources say that the metallic parts were intended for a bridge in Austria–Hungary over the Danube River in Vienna or Budapest. Finally another myth regarding the beams of the bridge says that the parts were intended for an unspecified site but the vessel transporting mysteriously sunk and the authorities in Senegal took advantage of this situation and built a local bridge.|$|E
