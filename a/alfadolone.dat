50|$|<b>Alfadolone</b> (INN), or alphadolone is a neuroactive steroid {{and general}} anesthetic. Along with alfaxolone, as <b>alfadolone</b> acetate, {{it is one}} of the {{components}} of the anesthetic drug mixture althesin.|$|E
50|$|Alfaxolone/alfadolone is short-duration, {{intravenous}} anaesthetic {{made from}} a combination of two steroidal compounds, alfaxalone and <b>alfadolone</b> of which the former is the primary anasethetic agent. <b>Alfadolone</b> acts to increase the solubility of the mixture in which it is dissolved, a polyethylated castor oil adjuvant. Anaesthetic efficacy is achieved by allosteric potentiation of the GABAA chloride channel to produce 'fast' synaptic inhibition.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, a {{combination}} of alfaxalone and <b>alfadolone</b> acetate was released as the anesthetics Althesin (for human use) and Saffan (for veterinary use). The two were dissolved in Cremophor EL: a polyoxyelthylated castor oil surfactant.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} derivatives and analogues of allopregnanolone with similar activity and effects exist, including <b>alfadolone</b> (3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione), alfaxolone (3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione), ganaxolone (3α-hydroxy-3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), minaxolone (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one), Org 20599 (21-chloro-3α-hydroxy-2β-morpholin-4-yl-5β-pregnan-20-one), Org 21465 (2β-(2,2-dimethyl-4-morpholinyl)-3α-hydroxy-11,20-dioxo-5α-pregnan-21-yl methanesulfonate), and renanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-11,20-dione).|$|E
50|$|Alfaxolone/alfadolone (brand names Althesin (human), Saffan (veterinary) {{is a short}} acting {{intravenous}} anaesthetic agent. It {{was withdrawn}} from the market due to severe drug reactions. It is composed of a 3:1 mixture of alfaxalone and <b>alfadolone,</b> two neurosteroids.|$|E
50|$|Renanolone (INN), or 11-ketopregnanolone, {{also known}} as 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} neuroactive steroid which {{is described as a}} general anesthetic but was never introduced for clinical use. Its isomers, alfaxolone and <b>alfadolone,</b> are also general anesthetics, and are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, a property which is likely the case for renanolone as well.|$|E
50|$|Alfaxalone was marketed in 1971 in {{combination}} with <b>alfadolone</b> acetate under the brand name Althesin for human use and Saffan for veterinary use. Althesin was withdrawn from the market in 1984, whereas Saffan remained marketed. A new formulation containing alfaxalone only was introduced for veterinary use in 1999 under the brand name Alfaxan. Following the introduction of Alfaxan, Saffan was gradually discontinued and is now no longer marketed. Another new formulation containing alfaxalone alone is currently under development for use in humans with the tentative brand name Phaxan.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, a {{lyophilized}} form of alfaxalone {{was released}} for cats. The new drug, Alfaxan, used a cyclodextrin as a carrier agent to make alfaxalone more water soluble rather than Camphor EL. <b>Alfadolone</b> {{was not included}} in the mixture, as its hypnotic effects were quite weak. An aqueous form of Alfaxan was released in Australia in 2000-2001, and Saffan was finally removed from the market in 2002. Alfaxan was released in the UK in 2007, central Europe in 2008, Canada in 2011, and the United States in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Althesin {{was removed}} from the market in 1984 for causing anaphylaxis; it was later found that this was due to Cremphor EL, which caused the body to release {{histamine}}, rather than alfaxolone or <b>alfadolone.</b> Saffan {{was removed from}} use for dogs only, but stayed on for other animals, none of which histamine release to the same extant that dogs did. It was still especially valued in cats for its lack of depressant effects on the cardiovascular system, which made it three times less fatal than any other anesthetic on the market at the time. The release of histamine caused most cats (70%) to have edema and hyperemia in their ears and paws; only some also got laryngeal or pulmonary edema.|$|E
40|$|Denervation-induced {{changes in}} the {{synaptic}} efficacy of single electroreceptors in catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus, Teleostei) were studied in vivo under <b>alfadolone</b> anaesthesia. At 16 °C the following effects were found 48 h post-operatively: (1) the average amplitude of the extra-dermally recorded spikes decreased from 100 to less than 20 μV; (2) the average resting discharge decreased from 40 to less than 25 spikes/s; (3) neither the sensitivity nor the frequency characteristic changed. The {{results indicate that the}} resting discharge and the modulation mechanism of sensory synapses are controlled by different biochemical mechanisms. The resting discharge seems {{to be related to the}} trophic function of the afferent nerve and to its generator region, whereas the modulation mechanism is apparently associated with the receptor cell...|$|E
40|$|Analgo-sedation {{implies the}} use of {{intravenous}} drugs for analgesia and sedation in patients undergoing outpatient operations or one-day surgery, in which vital signs (SpO 2, NIBP, HR, RR, EtCO 2) are steadily supervised (1, 2). Sedation and analgesia are different conditions: some patients may only need sedation, others only analgesia or both. Analgo-sedation allows the operator {{to work in the}} most favorable conditions, given that the patient becomes collaborative, extremely quiet and compliant with the procedure, even in cases of hours long procedures, all carried in absolute safety. Milestones in analgo-sedation: Between the 1920 ’s and the mid 1950 ’s the only drugs used as sedatives and hypnotics were barbiturates (Somnifen®, Pernocton®, Pentothal®, Evipal®, etc.). The use of barbiturates declined in the 1950 ’s after the development of the benzodiazepine derivatives. In 1959, De Castro and Mundeleer introduced the concept of neuroleptoanalgesia followed by the release of "Innovar®", a 50 : 1 combination of droperidol and fentanyl, both originally synthesized by Janssen pharmaceuticals, which was followed on the Italian market by “Leptofen®” (Famitalia). The next advance in analgosedation at the end of 70 s, was the release of the steroid anesthetic "Althesin®", a surprising combination of the two steroidal compounds, alfaxalone and <b>alfadolone.</b> In spite of its deplorable histamine release, althesin safety profile due to its highest (30 / 1) therapeutic index among all anesthetic molecules, bestowed to it a long-lasting popularity. The advent of noncumulative anesthetic molecules brought the new concept of TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) in the field of analgosedation. Most of this unexpected innovation was due to the hypnotic alkylphenol derivative Propofol® and to the opioid agonist remifentanil hydrochloride, both characterized by fast and alternative metabolic pathways. In virtue of their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics peculiarities, propofol and remifentanil, administered by TCI (Target Controlled Infusion), are nowadays the ideal drugs for analgosedation (3). Administered by TCI, such hypnotic/opioid combination warrants extreme precision in dose titration, fast and predictable variations in analgo-sedation depth, reduction of total administered dose, very fast recovery of consciousness and reduction of hospitalization times. Currently, Remimazolam, a new benzodiazepine now in phase III of clinical experimentation, seems to promise further development and enhancement to the current analgo-sedation techniques (4). It is worth to note that parallel advancement in veterinary analgosedation was provided in the same years by parallel anesthetic formulations named pentothal vet®, Innovar vet®, Saffan® (alfaxalone and <b>alfadolone),</b> Rapinovet® (propofol), and by the off label use of most of the formulations of the anesthetic molecules approved for use in humans...|$|E
