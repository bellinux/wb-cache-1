40|$|A study <b>of</b> {{chromosome}} <b>aberrations</b> {{induced by}} 1 -Beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara C) and Adriamycin (AM) in the chromosomes of cultured human lymphocytes was made. There were {{significant increases in}} the frequency <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> with increasing concentrations of both Ara C (2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mug/ml) and AM (0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 15 mug/ml). The frequency <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> induced by both drugs also showed a 'levelling off' above particular concentrations. For Ara C the effect of increasing treatment time was also studied. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> increased significantly with increasing treatment times (2, 3 and 4 hrs) although no 'levelling off' in the number <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> was observed. The relationship between {{the frequency of the}} different types <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> induced by Ara C and AM was studied. AM allowed for a study of the relative frequency of chromosome versus chromatid aberrations and fragment versus exchange aberrations. There were always more fragments than exchanges, and always more chromatid aberrations than chromosome aberrations. Aberrations induced by Ara C were all of the chromatid fragment type. A study was made of the distribution of inter- and intra-chromosomal aberrations in relation to light and dark G banded chromosomes. Both drugs induced more aberrations in the light G bands than the dark G bands. Both drugs showed distinct clustering <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> in some regions of the chromosomes (hotspots), although the location of AM induced hotspots was different from the location of those induced by Ara C. The distribution of AM induced chromatid aberrations was different from the distribution <b>of</b> the chromosome <b>aberrations,</b> as were the distributions of the fragment and exchange aberrations. The different types <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> also differed in the number <b>of</b> AM induced <b>aberrations</b> per unit length between the p and q arms. There were more aberrations per unit length in the p arm than in the q arm for exchanges, whereas for fragments and chromosome aberrations the reverse was true. For chromatid aberrations, {{there was no significant difference}} in the number <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> per unit length between the p and q arms. Inter-individual differences in the frequency <b>of</b> AM induced <b>aberrations</b> were observed in the. AM dosage experiments. Also there was a suggestion that the distribution of Ara C induced aberrations was different for different donors. AM increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. Comparable results were not sought for Ara C because after cells were exposed to Ara C they did not pass through an S phase of the cell cycle, as is the case for cells exposed to AM.

40|$|DE 102007024700 A 1 UPAB: 20081217 NOVELTY - Focusing is {{effected}} {{to form a}} beam waist. Fractions of {{the beam}} (7) are deflected to diverge from the axis (4) at, ahead of and/or after the beam waist, hence being directed away from the beam axis. The fractions and their <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> divergence exceed those resulting from imaging errors arising inevitably with standard optics and which can be taken into account. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The increased <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> divergence are used to reduce the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence {{on the surface of}} interaction (8), in this way increasing surface absorption and reducing variation of absorption with fluctuations in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence. Such divergences are produced internally or externally to the laser, using one or more beam-forming optics. They are achieved in one or more ways, as follows. The beam-forming optic has increased aberration. It has correspondingly-increased positive- or negative spherical aberrations and/or chromatic aberrations. Diffractive and/or diffusive optical elements are employed. The optical elements are solid, liquid and/or gaseous materials or media, with transmissive and/or refractive properties. Concave and convex optical interfaces achieve the aberration. The optic causing aberration, simultaneously collimates and/or focuses the beam. At least one aspherical surface is used. The optic is an axicon (conical lens) or Fresnel optic. Aberration is formed by one or more optics having a refractive index varying laterally and/or axially. The optic is adaptive, permitting the degree <b>of</b> <b>aberration</b> and/or the lateral and/or axial distribution <b>of</b> <b>aberration</b> to be adjusted. A control unit adjusts and matches working parameters during operation. These include: type of material (1), material thickness, operating velocity and/or laser power. The optic adjusts the maximum <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> divergence to form spatial power density distributions. These are ring- or top-hat distributions at the surface of interaction. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR corresponding equipment. USE - A method of focused laser beam processing, especially intended to remove or displace material at a surface of interaction. ADVANTAGE - The new method leads to partial absorption of the beam at the surface of interaction, to remove or displace material. The beam is formed in the interaction zone, {{in such a way that}} processing efficiency and stability, exceed those achievable by current techniques. Taking the example of cutting, the groove produced can be deeper for a given width. Excessive cutting width is avoided. All process parameters are optimized simultaneously by the control system, resulting in an increase of processing quality by avoidance of subjective errors...|$|R

In particular, a combination of cytogenetic techniques has allowed the identification <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> associated with cancer development, including cancers of the skin. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of cytogenetic alterations in basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

Basal cell carcinomas, although relatively stable lesions, are highly associated with recurrent <b>aberrations</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes 6, 7, 9 and X, as detected by a number of cytogenetic techniques.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{elucidate}} whether an enhanced skin radiation reaction correlated with an enhanced chromosome radiation response. Twelve patients with late radiation skin ulcers formed after courses of radiation therapy were chosen as a group of individuals with elevated skin radiosensitivity. Half of the venous blood samples from each donor were irradiated with 2 Gy gamma-rays; the other half remained unexposed. Using standard cytogenetic technique, lymphocyte cultures were prepared with all samples. On the metaphase preparations, all chromosome aberrations detectable without karyotype identification were scored. The frequency <b>of</b> various <b>aberrations</b> in each patient were compared with relevant mean values in healthy unexposed donors. In several patients, the frequency <b>of</b> one <b>aberration</b> type or another exceeded the control value significantly. Comparison <b>of</b> <b>aberration</b> patterns in irradiated and nonirradiated cultures and consideration of elapsed time after therapeutic exposures suggested that the observed increased aberration levels reflected individual features of the patients' radiosensitivity, rather than lesions induced by previous in vivo exposures. Therefore, the question of a correlation between skin and chromosome radiosensitivity can be answered positively. Analysis of the peculiarities of cellular distribution <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> and <b>of</b> the relative contribution <b>of</b> different <b>aberration</b> types in patients and healthy donors indicates that the investigation <b>of</b> in vitro-induced <b>aberrations</b> is more suitable for the assessment of individual radiosensitivity than the study <b>of</b> <b>aberrations</b> observed in unexposed cultures...|$|R
