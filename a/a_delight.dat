5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Ramanuja {{believes}} that Vishnu wishing to do a favour {{to those who}} are resolved on acting so as fully to please Him, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles {{in the way of the}} attainment of God.|$|E

25|$|Another {{occasion}} to exercise his diplomatic ability soon arose. The British government suspected that warships had been outfitted {{in the port}} of Dubrovnik for the service of France, and that therefore the neutrality of the Republic of Ragusa had been violated. Bošković was selected to undertake an ambassadorship to London (1760), to vindicate the character of his native place and satisfy the government. This mission he discharged successfully – a credit to him and <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> to his countrymen. During his stay in England he was elected {{a fellow of the}} Royal Society.|$|E

500|$|Several critics praised Tucci's {{performance}} and his interactions with Shalhoub. Diane Werts wrote for Newsday, [...] "Which one's nuttier? It's a toss-up, and a fascinating {{one with the}} terrific Tucci as Shalhoub's emotional tango partner." [...] A reviewer for Times Colonist commented [...] "Watching Shalhoub pretend to be Monk {{pretending to be a}} suave, sophisticated sleuth is <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> in its own right. Watching Tucci take Monk's nervous tics to ridiculous extremes is even more of <b>a</b> <b>delight,</b> especially when its appears that Monk's nervous disorder may be catching." [...] In contrast to other reviewers, Adam Finley of AOL TV elected the best moment of the episode Disher's reaction to the fact his role is played by a woman who dates Stottlemeyer.|$|E

500|$|The {{archaeologist}} Aubrey Burl {{noted that}} while [...] "this petite ring should be <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> to see", it was instead a [...] "frustration" [...] {{as a result}} of its restricted location.

500|$|Adam thought Ciceri's {{backdrop}} for Act I was [...] "not so good ... {{it is all}} weak and pale" [...] but he liked the set for Act II: [...] " [...] second act is <b>a</b> <b>delight,</b> a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees {{at the end of}} the piece, and very magical in its effect." [...] The sunrise also delighted the critics.|$|E

500|$|Betelguese, a Trip Through Hell is a 1908 lyrical poem {{book written}} by Jean Louis De Esque. The {{publication}} includes a preface {{by the author}} with two poetic works, [...] "When I am Gone" [...] and [...] "Betelguese." [...] The latter poem {{has been called a}} [...] "classic" [...] work that utilized off-beat language, considered to be <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> to the philologist. It has been compared to the poetic works of George Sterling and Kenneth Patchen.|$|E
500|$|In {{his sleeve}} notes for the 1975 release of The Basement Tapes, Greil Marcus wrote, [...] "What {{was taking place}} as Dylan and The Band fiddled with the tunes, was less a style than a spirit—a spirit {{that had to do}} with <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> in {{friendship}} and invention." [...] He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: [...] "The Basement Tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley's 'Mystery Train' or Robert Johnson's 'Love In Vain." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} of Latin prose improved in the tenth century, especially after about 960, when {{the leaders of}} the Benedictine reform movement adopted the elaborate and ornate style of Latin now called by historians the hermeneutic style. However, use of this style, influenced especially by Aldhelm's De virginitate, dates back to King Æthelstan's reign. [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] borrowed heavily from Aldhelm, although he would not copy whole sentences, only a word or a few words, incorporating them in a structure reminiscent of Aldhelm's works. In Woodman's view, [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] varied the language in each charter out of <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> in experimentation and to demonstrate his literary ability.|$|E

500|$|In another 2014 review, for the Lexington Herald-Leader, Walter Tunis writes: [...] " [...] is <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> {{from the}} start of the brightly orchestrated pop of 'You' to a series of light soul-savvy reveries that culminate in the playful 'His Name is Legs'. The record places the secular and spiritual {{concerns}} of Harrison's music in animated balance to close out The Apple Years in a state of hapless harmony." [...] Writing in Mojo, Tom Doyle concedes that, being the final album in the box set, [...] "It's possibly a downbeat note to end on", but welcomes the reissue for [...] "allow us time to dig for the diamonds in the dirt".|$|E
500|$|Fey {{and former}} SNL castmate Amy Poehler {{starred in the}} 2008 comedy Baby Mama. The movie was written and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. The plot concerns Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant, decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), a white-trash schemer. Baby Mama received mixed reviews, but critics enjoyed Fey's performance. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: [...] "Fey is <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing." [...] The movie grossed over US$64million at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Overall {{reception}} of Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon was also positive, though some reviewers felt {{that several of}} the tracks were of lesser quality {{than the rest of the}} album. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described it as [...] "Awesome. Purely spectacular." [...] and Matt Brady of Final Fantasy Symphony concurred, saying that the [...] "music quality for this soundtrack was spectacular." [...] Daniel Space of RPGFan, however, found the quality mixed, and said that [...] "some of the pieces do not live up to the new orchestration," [...] although others [...] "were <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> to hear." [...] He also found some of the instruments to be slightly out of tune, which he disliked, though Matt Brady felt it gave the pieces an [...] "ethnic feel".|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Pacino {{starred in}} Frankie and Johnny with Michelle Pfeiffer, who co-starred with Pacino in Scarface. Pacino portrays a {{recently}} paroled cook who begins {{a relationship with}} a waitress (Pfeiffer) in the diner where they work. It was adapted by Terrence McNally from his own Off-Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (1987), that featured Kenneth Welsh and Kathy Bates. The film received mixed reviews, although Pacino later said he enjoyed playing the part. Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his [...] "Dog Day Afternoon" [...] days, and he makes Johnny's endless enterprise in wooing Frankie <b>a</b> <b>delight.</b> His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film's maudlin aspects at bay." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the ZX81 {{highlighted}} the great {{value for money}} offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in Your Computer, [...] "the ZX81 is both <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> and a disappointment". He applauded the improvements {{that had been made}} over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 [...] "a very good first computer" [...] that [...] "will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost." [...] However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was [...] "mandatory for any worthwhile use". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.|$|E
500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>delight</b> to finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead." ...|$|E
