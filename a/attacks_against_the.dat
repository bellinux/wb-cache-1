5|$|Beginning in 1991, Jashari {{participated in}} <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Serbian police before {{travelling}} to Albania to receive military training. Arrested in 1993, {{he was released}} {{at the behest of}} the Albanian Army and later returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997, he was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched an attack against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that followed resulted in the deaths of 58 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife, brother and son.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May, the Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan {{announced}} that they had thwarted a series of planned terror <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Eurovision Song Contest, among the targets being Baku Crystal Hall, as well as Marriott and Hilton hotels in Baku. On 22 August, The Daily Telegraph reported that according to Western intelligence services, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei personally gave orders to the elite Quds Force unit to launch terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> West and its allies, including Azerbaijan during the Eurovision Song Contest.|$|E
5|$|During {{their first}} decade of existence, they {{had an average of}} two actions per year. The group claimed {{responsibility}} for the 1978 bombing of a small power station in the San Juan area, the 1979 retaliation <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> United States armed forces personnel, the 1981 attacks on Puerto Rico Air National Guard aircraft, and a 1983 Wells Fargo bank robbery.|$|E

5|$|Mardonius also {{initiated}} hit-and-run cavalry <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Greek lines, possibly {{trying to}} lure the Greeks down to the plain in pursuit. Although having some initial success, this strategy backfired when the Persian cavalry commander Masistius was killed; with his death, the cavalry retreated.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the area}} was secured, {{defensive}} positions were established along the Čelić–Lopare road and company strength units were sent out to conduct reconnaissance. On the night of 17–18 March, elements of the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division and 36th Vojvodina Division mounted unsuccessful <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> 28th Regiment's positions at Koraj and Zabrđe, losing over 200.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul do {{not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E

5000|$|The {{agitators}} {{also set}} up a camp at Kariath Mission School consisting of 1,000 gun carriers {{in order to prevent}} the coming of military forces. The attack on the police station as per the Government view, is tantamount to an <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Government. The judgement says [...] "Police is the visible symbol of the Government, the conspicuous machinery through which law and order, which is the primary duty of the Government is maintained and that an <b>attack</b> directed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> police and their office is tantamount to an <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Government." ...|$|R
5|$|During the Boer War, the {{importance}} of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, {{and the use of}} wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.|$|E
5|$|In August and September, the VRS {{launched}} several <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Bosanski Brod bridgehead {{for little}} gain. In mid-September, the HVO and the ARBiH deployed near Brčko, {{further to the}} east, attacked the same east–west road the VRS aimed to secure through Operation Corridor 92. The counterattack managed to capture {{a section of the}} road south of Orašje, at the eastern end of the Brčko corridor. However, the VRS restored its control of the road quickly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Khazir {{was a major}} {{setback for}} the Umayyads, who did not launch another {{invasion}} of Iraq until 691. However, al-Mukhtar's victory was short-lived as he was killed a year later when the Zubayrids took over Kufa. Meanwhile, the blood feud between the Qaysi and Yamani tribal elements of the Umayyad Caliphate intensified due to Umayr's mid-battle defection and subsequent spearheading of <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tribes of Taghlib and Kalb. In these later battles, the Kalb were led by Humayd ibn Hurayth al-Kalbi, an Umayyad commander who survived Khazir.|$|E

5|$|Lukashenko blamed {{foreign governments}} for conspiring against him and, in April 1998, {{expelled}} ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near Minsk and moved them to another building. The Drazdy conflict caused an international outcry {{and resulted in}} a travel ban on Lukashenko from the EU and the US. Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy died down, Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> West. He stated that Western governments were trying to undermine Belarus at all levels, even sports, during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.|$|E
5|$|The German and Ottoman {{objective}} {{was not to}} cross the canal, but to capture Romani and establish a strongly entrenched heavy artillery position opposite Kantara, from which to bombard shipping on the canal. Kress von Kressenstein's plan for the attack on Romani was to bombard the line of defensive redoubts with heavy artillery and employ only weak infantry detachments against them, while his main force launched <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> right and rear of the Romani position.|$|E
5|$|While Latour {{battered}} against Ney, Riesch launched <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> 4,100 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, and 16 guns {{belonging to}} Jean Hardy's division. A brigade belonging to Claude Legrand's division marched up and helped block Riesch's attempt to turn Hardy's flank. During the fighting, a shellburst wounded Hardy and {{caused him to}} hand over command to BG Bastoul. With both French divisions being slowly pressed back by superior numbers, Grenier gave orders for a withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qassam's militia grew when it {{was joined}} by another militia based in the {{mountains}} {{following the death of}} its commander Umar al-Bitar. However, as the French tightened their control of the area, they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh's major landowners to drop their financial support for al-Qassam and pay taxes to the French Mandate government. This further isolated al-Qassam who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920. There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July. As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo, al-Qassam and members of his unit fled past French Army lines with forged passports to Tartus.|$|E

5|$|Although Hananu's revolt {{was largely}} suppressed, a {{low-level}} insurgency involving small ′iṣābāt persisted in Aleppo's countryside. Al-Sa'dun and Uwaid opted {{to continue the}} armed struggle, fleeing to the coastal mountains {{and from there to}} Turkey in December 1921. From the frontier area with Syria, they staged hit-and-run attacks against French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance. On 26 August, al-Sa'dun's ′iṣābā assaulted a postal convoy in al-Darakiya, a village between Darkush and Antioch. In 1923, rebel commander Aqil al-Saqati and ten of his fighters launched numerous <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> French, including an assault against a government building in al-Safira, southeast of Aleppo, and Jisr al-Hadid near Antakya.|$|E
5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open field of battle, with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover {{the location of a}} cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were moved to another settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to be burned.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E
