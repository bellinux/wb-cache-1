5|$|Once {{back in the}} city, {{however, the}} Patriarch and Apokaukos seized power. Kantakouzenos's family and friends were imprisoned (Kantakouzenos's mother Theodora would {{eventually}} die in prison) and the Patriarch was declared regent, while Anna named Apokaukos <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> prefect (eparchos) of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the emperor}} by others might be gained at the daily {{reception}} (salutatio), a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues. By the 4th century, <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> centres decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.|$|E
40|$|A brief stop through Iowa State University {{has left}} me {{compelled}} {{to reflect upon}} an invigorating intellectual-training-session hosted by a former professor, Ross Adams. The two day symposium ‘What is the Urban? Registers of a World Interior’ was organized around a simple question that underpins Adams’ research: what actually is urbanization and the urban? The 14 lectures were divided into four broad categories intended to cast light upon this condition: <b>Urban</b> <b>as</b> Interior, <b>Urban</b> <b>as</b> Factory, <b>Urban</b> <b>as</b> Strategy, and <b>Urban</b> <b>as</b> Becoming...|$|R

5|$|Of Manitoba's 37 urban municipalities, 6 have {{population}}s {{less than}} the current minimum population requirement of 1,000 and 20 have {{less than the}} current minimum density requirement of 400 residents per square kilometre. All of these were incorporated <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> municipalities prior to the Municipal Act being enacted in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{mourning}} dove occupies {{a wide variety}} of open and semi-open habitats, such <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas. It avoids swamps and thick forest. The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. They commonly nest in trees in cities or near farmsteads.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation in the {{watershed}} is {{closely tied to}} elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with oak, aspen and coniferous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, sagebrush, juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified <b>as</b> <b>urban.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>urban</b> populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After {{the passing of}} the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.|$|E
5|$|Crispi was {{replaced}} {{as prime minister}} by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891, who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892. On January 20, 1893, when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs, local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre. Disturbances continued throughout the year. The Fasci started out <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> movements, animated by artisans, which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners, and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers. In the autumn of 1893, labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers. The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes, involving the lowest tiers {{of the city and}} the countryside, becoming difficult, if not impossible, to control by its leaders.|$|E
5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known <b>as</b> <b>Urban</b> Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted in the same way <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> water supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Farm to Market Road1938 (FM1938) is a Farm to Market Road in the US {{state of}} Texas. The highway runs from State Highway26 (SH26) to FM1709, in Tarrant County.

While located in Southlake, from the {{northern}} border of Southlake to its junction with FM1709, FM1938 is named Randol Mill Avenue, and from the FM1709 intersection to its southern terminus, the highway is named Davis Boulevard. FM1938 was designated in 1952, in Hockley County, but was cancelled and redesignated in 1955, at its modern location in Tarrant County. In 1995, the entire route of FM 1938 was redesignated <b>as</b> <b>Urban</b> Road 1938 (UR 1938) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).

5|$|With the {{increased}} flood protection {{afforded by the}} Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transition—from agricultural to urban. The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplain—an area once occupied by farms—and the river became confined to a narrow channel—a flood {{similar to the ones}} surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known <b>as</b> <b>urban</b> runoff. In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Dam—probably saving Orange County from an even greater flood—Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.|$|E
