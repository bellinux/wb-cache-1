25|$|In his {{psychological}} theory – {{which is}} not necessarily linked to a particular theory of social structure – the persona appears as a consciously created personality or identity fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through socialization, <b>acculturation</b> <b>and</b> experience. Jung applied the term persona, explicitly because, in Latin, it means both personality and the masks worn by Roman actors of the classical period, expressive of the individual roles played.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of Asian American has variations {{that derive from}} {{the use of the word}} American in different contexts. Immigration status, citizenship (by birthright and by naturalization), <b>acculturation,</b> <b>and</b> language ability are some variables that are used to define American for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage. For example, restricting American to include only U.S. citizens conflicts with discussions of Asian American businesses, which generally refer both to citizen and non-citizen owners.|$|E

50|$|The term personhood {{is often}} {{ascribed}} by experts to animals who demonstrate conscious awareness, language, <b>and</b> <b>acculturation.</b> Miles <b>and</b> like-minded advocates seek to expand personhood to great apes, {{to the extent}} that—eventually—legal rights of personhood would be conferred under the law.|$|R
25|$|But {{it was an}} {{external}} threat, more than anything else, that mended relations. While traditional Jewish society remained well entrenched in backward Eastern Europe, reports of the rapid <b>acculturation</b> <b>and</b> religious laxity in the West troubled both camps. When the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment, appeared in Galicia and Congress Poland in the 1810s, it was soon perceived as a dire threat. The maskilim themselves detested Hasidism as an anti-rationalist and barbaric phenomenon, as did Western Jews of all shades, including the most right-wing Orthodox such as Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer. In Galicia especially, hostility towards it defined the Haskalah to a large extent, from the staunchly observant Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes and Joseph Perl to the radical anti-Talmudists like Osias Schorr. The Enlightened, who revived Hebrew grammar, often mocked their rivals' lack of eloquence in the language. While a considerable proportion of the Misnagdim were not adverse to {{at least some of}} the Haskalas goals, the Rebbes were unremittingly hostile.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, American and European {{trade and}} {{settlement}} initially {{led to the}} growth of totem pole carving, but United States and Canadian policies and practices of <b>acculturation</b> <b>and</b> assimilation caused a decline in the development of Alaska Native and First Nations cultures and their crafts, and sharply reduced totem pole production {{by the end of the}} century. Between 1830 and 1880, the maritime fur trade, mining, and fisheries gave rise to an accumulation of wealth among the coastal peoples. Much of it was spent and distributed in lavish potlatch celebrations, frequently associated with the construction and erection of totem poles. The monumental poles commissioned by wealthy family leaders to represent their social status and the importance of their families and clans. In the 1880s and 1890s, tourists, collectors, scientists and naturalist interested in native culture collected and photographed totem poles and other artifacts, many of which were put on display at expositions such as the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{resistance}} was sporadic, yet at times fierce, but was largely crushed by 1902, although relatively minor rebellions occurred in subsequent years, including the Ta-pa-ni incident of 1915 in Tainan county. Nonviolent means of resistance {{began to take}} place of armed rebellions and the most prominent organization was the Taiwanese Cultural Association, founded in 1921. Taiwanese {{resistance was}} caused by several different factors (e.g., the Taishō Democracy). Some were goaded by Chinese nationalism, while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination. Rebellions were often caused {{by a combination of}} the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant millenarian beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies of <b>acculturation</b> <b>and</b> pacification lasted up until the early 1930s. The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the Musha Uprising (Wushe Uprising) in late 1930 by the Atayal people angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of camphor extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school. The uprising, led by Mona Rudao, was crushed by 2,000-3,000 Japanese troops and Aboriginal auxiliaries with the help of poison gas.|$|E
30|$|A major {{limitation}} of the present research lies in its cross-sectional design. The relationships between religious identity, <b>acculturation</b> orientations <b>and</b> socio-cultural adjustment are merely correlational, and thereby do not allow for causal interpretations. To gain more clarity about the proposed relationships <b>and</b> the roles of <b>acculturation</b> conditions, orientations <b>and</b> outcomes, longitudinal study designs would be needed.

500|$|Particularly {{among the}} Plains Aborigines, as {{the degree of}} the [...] "civilizing projects" [...] {{increased}} during each successive regime, the aborigines found themselves in greater contact with outside cultures. The process of <b>acculturation</b> <b>and</b> assimilation sometimes followed gradually {{in the wake of}} broad social currents, particularly the removal of ethnic markers (such as bound feet, dietary customs and clothing), which had formerly distinguished ethnic groups on Taiwan. The removal or replacement of these brought about an incremental transformation from [...] "Fan" [...] (barbarian) to the dominant Confucian [...] "Han" [...] culture.

Central-American immigrants continue to enter the United States, but the pre and post effects of the migration process have been widely ignored. Largely ignored has been the wellbeing of the 1. 5 -Generation (1. 5 -G) of immigrant children and their families.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{associations of}} ethnic identity, <b>acculturation</b> orientations, <b>and</b> <b>acculturation</b> outcomes (psychological well-being and socio-cultural adjustment) {{in a sample}} of 279 Turkish-Bulgarian adolescents through self-reports and parent reports. This group {{has a long history of}} discrimination and exposure to assimilation pressure. According to both the youth and their parents, their Turkish ethnic identity was more pronounced than their Bulgarian identity. As expected, the Turkish identity was positively related to the tendency to maintain one's heritage culture, whereas the Bulgarian identity was associated with the adoption of the national culture. A good fit was found for a multigroup path model (testing the invariance of parental and self-reports) in which ethnic identity <b>and</b> <b>acculturation</b> orientations affect acculturation outcomes. Particularly Turkish ethnic identity and Turkish maintenance were significantly associated with acculturation outcomes. Findings highlight the centrality of Turkish domains of identity <b>and</b> <b>acculturation</b> for both well-being <b>and</b> positive <b>acculturation</b> outcomes in Turkish-Bulgarian youth. We discussed how an adolescent's heritage culture might be important for his or her identity <b>and</b> <b>acculturation.</b> Highlights ► Turkish identity positively related to well-being of Turkish-Bulgarians. ► Turkish identity and Turkish culture positively related to well-being and adjustment of Turkish-Bulgarians. ► Importance of heritage identity <b>and</b> <b>acculturation</b> orientations well-being in stigmatized bicultural group.

500|$|Beginning {{nearly a}} century later, as {{the rule of the}} Qing Empire {{expanded}} over wider groups of people, writers and gazetteers recast their descriptions away from reflecting degree of <b>acculturation,</b> <b>and</b> toward a system that defined the aborigines relative to their submission or hostility to Qing rule. Qing used the term [...] "raw/wild/uncivilized" [...] (...) to define those people who had not submitted to Qing rule, and [...] "cooked/tamed/civilized" [...] (...) for those who had pledged their allegiance through their payment of a head tax. According to the standards of the Qianlong Emperor and successive regimes, the epithet [...] "cooked" [...] was synonymous with having assimilated to Han cultural norms, and living as a subject of the Empire, but it retained a pejorative designation to signify the perceived cultural lacking of the non-Han people. This designation reflected the prevailing idea that anyone could be civilized/tamed by adopting Confucian social norms.|$|E
