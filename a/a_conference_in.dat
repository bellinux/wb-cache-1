5|$|In August 2011, {{extracts}} from She Has a Name were read at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Strathmore called Justice Tapestry. A {{reading of the}} play took place during an event at Mount Royal University on February 16, 2012, which also included a speech by Yvon Dandurand {{on the subject of}} human trafficking, and a book signing by John Winterdyk for his book Human Trafficking: Exploring the International Nature, Concerns, and Complexities.|$|E
5|$|Police also {{conducted}} a routine re-examination of other unsolved murder cases dating back 20 years {{in areas where}} Smith had lived. Officers from West Midlands Police held <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> October 2001 with representatives from several other forces, including Gloucestershire and West Mercia, to share information about unsolved murder cases in their areas. Detectives interviewed Smith three times, {{but he refused to}} answer their questions, and no further charges were brought.|$|E

5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Zagreb, just as German {{tanks were}} {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović {{that he could}} no longer hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the University, Arafat studied civil engineering and {{served as president of}} the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) from 1952 to 1956. During his first year as president of the union, the University was renamed Cairo University after a coup was carried out by the Free Officers Movement overthrowing King Farouk I. By that time, Arafat had graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and was called to duty to fight with Egyptian forces during the Suez Crisis; however, he never actually fought. Later that year, at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Prague, he donned a solid white keffiyeh–different from the fishnet-patterned one he adopted later in Kuwait, which was to become his emblem.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat to <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> a meeting hall {{on the campus}} of Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's waiting train.|$|E

5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> 2011, the two {{new leaders}} of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E
5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> September 1906, {{many of the}} {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|By 15 March, Soviet commanders {{introduced}} preliminary {{plans for}} an offensive towards Kharkov, assisted by {{a large number of}} reserves. On 20 March, Timoshenko held <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Kupiansk to discuss the offensive and a report to Moscow, prepared by Timoshenko's chief of staff, General Lieutenant Ivan Baghramian, summed up the conference, although arguably leaving several key intelligence features out. The build-up of Soviet forces in the region of Barvenkovo and Vovchansk continued well into the beginning of May. Final details were settled following discussions between Stalin, Stavka and the leadership of the Southwestern Strategic Direction led by Timoshenko throughout March and April, with one of the final Stavka directives issued on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes called for <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Washington D.C. {{to be held}} that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} and orders for Operation Trio were finalised at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Ljubljana on 28–29 March 1942. Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the {{commander of the}} Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to be concluded with the Herzegovinian Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, but not {{with any of the}} Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who was aligned with the Serb collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith {{took a picture of}} the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and {{was assumed to be}} infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, it was {{revealed}} that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre's—a married man who was estranged from his wife. This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Madras Dravidian Association was {{established}} by C. Natesa Mudaliar. Ramarayaningar was elected as the first President of the Association.

5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> {{the village}} of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, {{as well as an}} agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8b is {{the fifth}} of the first five exoplanets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which aims to discover planets in a region of the sky between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler.|$|E
