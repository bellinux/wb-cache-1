MIB Group, Inc. is a member-owned corporation that has operated on a not-for-profit basis in the United States and Canada since 1902. MIB's Underwriting Services are used exclusively by MIB's member life and health insurance companies to assess an individual's risk and eligibility during the underwriting of life, health, disability income, critical illness, and long-term care insurance policies. These services [...] "alert" [...] underwriters to errors, omissions or misrepresentations made on insurance applications. The information must be verified by a reliable source prior to any underwriting action being taken. MIB's subsidiaries offer other business services to members and customers in addition to MIB's Underwriting Services.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{anthropology}} and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. Anthropological historicism {{is associated with the}} work of Franz Boas. His theory used the diffusionist concept that there were a few [...] "cradles of civilization" [...] which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called historical particularism. The school of historicism grew in response to unilinear theories that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by Charles Darwin and many of his students, their application as applied in social Darwinism and general evolution characterized in the theories of Herbert Spencer and Leslie White, historicism was neither <b>anti-selection,</b> nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. Julian Steward refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the cultural ecology, by specific evolution. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.|$|E

I discuss the idea that both kinds of selection effects {{can lead to a}} form of confirmation bias at the level of perception, and argue that when this happens, selection effects can influence the rational role of experience...|$|E

The investigation was carried out by the Continuous Statistical Investigations (CSI) Committee of the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA). Some of the major findings of the investigation were worsening mortality below age 50, general improvements in mortality above age 50, substantial differences in mortality between the different socio-economic classes and signs of <b>anti-selection</b> below age 50, especially in the better socioeconomic classes...|$|E

Defined benefit schemes, which do smooth income, are open to manipulation {{and may not be}} financially viable. Defined contribution schemes can produce reasonably smooth incomes if assets are diversified and investment results are smoothed. This chapter describes smoothing algorithms that efficiently switch to safer investments before retirement. The algorithms provide a better alternative to traditional smoothing mechanisms because they are not subject to arbitrary discretion or <b>anti-selection.</b> 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the asymmetric information hypothesis in {{the political economy of}} protectionism is fruitful. We address this issue by modelling an international oligopolistic competition with a trade policy decision. The local government has set up an anti-dumping procedure, as it has been authorized by the World Trade Organization. When domestic firms are demanding it, this procedure allows for the imposition of ?individualized protection?, which accounts for the conditions of international competition. But governments have not the necessary information in order to set optimal policies. This information is private and belongs to domestic firms. This characterizes a political decision under asymmetric information. We define pooling and separating equilibria of this game. The conclusion presents the possibility of trade policy decision under moral hazard. anti-dumping procedures, oligopolistic competition, <b>anti-selection,</b> research et development, moral hazard...|$|E
40|$|For each regular cardinal, we set {{up three}} systems of infinitary type logic, in which {{the length of the}} types and the length of the typed syntactical {{constructs}} is !. For a fixed, these three versions are (in the order of increasing strength) : (1) the local system Σ (), (2) the global system gΣ () (the difference concerns the conditions on eigenvariables) and (3) the ø-system ø Σ () (which has <b>anti-selection</b> terms or Hilbertian ø -terms, and no conditions on eigenvariables). A full cut elimination theorem is proved for the local systems, and about the ø -systems we prove that they admit cut-free proofs for sequents in the ø -free language common to the local and global systems. These two results follow from semantic completeness proofs. No syntactical proofs for these two cut-elimination theorems are given. Also, every sequent provable in a global system has a cut-free proof in the corresponding ø-systems. It is an open, and apparently difficult problem whether the g [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Disability Income (DI) is {{important}} to both policyholders and insurance companies. Companies however have experienced significant losses in their DI business because of <b>anti-selection</b> and volatility risk. ^ In this dissertation, we define and measure volatility risk in terms of adequacy of DI claim reserves. Using stochastic simulation, we quantify the volatility risk under more than 5, 000 plan designs with 1, 000 simulations per design; Based on the simulation results, we provide a regression method to develop risk adjusted claim reserves from base claim reserves. In special cases, we prove some theorems about volatility risk and properties of DI termination rates. We use complete expectation time of staying disabled to obtain a simple approximation and give an analytic approximation of volatility risk. We also apply statistical tests of the closeness of fit of the regression and analytical results to the 2 ̆ 7 true 2 ̆ 7 volatility risk. Finally, we discuss the applications of our methods {{to the development of}} active life reserves, risk adjusted premiums (DI pricing problem) and applications to other 2 ̆ 7 risky 2 ̆ 7 forms of insurance. ...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Med) Genetic Counselling, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2009 The life {{insurance}} industry’s ability to access genetic test results has raised public concern regarding loss {{of privacy and}} discrimination. The insurer requires access to genetic test results to reduce the impact of individuals changing their insurance purchasing behaviour based on a predictive genetic test result, of which the insurer is unaware (<b>anti-selection).</b> In South Africa, industry guidelines have been established {{to reduce the risk}} of genetic discrimination whilst enabling insurance companies’ access to this information for appropriate assessment of insurance risk. This study was the first to investigate the use of genetic tests by the {{life insurance}} industry of South Africa and their compliance with the guidelines, in order to identify behaviour that could result in genetic discrimination or unexpected risk exposure for the insurer. A structured interview process was conducted with 13 companies (8 insurance companies and 5 reinsurance companies), representing the individual life insurance industry. The interview guide was structured in a manner to gain insight into the companies’ approach to using genetic information, including genetic test results, in defining the policy terms of an individual’s life insurance contract. This study found that the companies’ responses to genetic information, particularly genetic test results, were demonstrated to be aligned with the regulatory guidelines. Irregularities in their processes were noted and these could lead to discrimination or increased risk exposure for the insurance company. These resulted from inconsistencies noted in the companies’ understanding of the genetic disease mechanisms of a medical condition, which is used to interpret the genetic information to assign risk. In conclusion, this study identified the need for a consistent approach to the interpretation of genetic information which would reduce the risk of genetic discrimination. This may be established through the support of specialist genetic services...|$|E
