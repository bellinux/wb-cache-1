40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is {{to lead to a}} further {{understanding}} of the neural mechanisms underlying object feature binding in the human brain. The focus is on information processing and integration in the visual system and visual short-term memory. From {{a review of the literature}} it is clear that there are three major competing binding theories, however, none of these individually solves the binding problem satisfactorily. Thus the {{aim of this}} research is to conduct behavioural experimentation into object feature binding, paying particular attention to visual short-term memory. Findings from the experiment, which focuses on spatial and temporal aspects of object feature binding and feature proximity on binding errors, primarily support the spatial theories on object feature binding, however we propose that temporal theories and convergence, through hierarchical feature analysis, are also involved. Traditionally, these theories have purported to provide individual solutions, but this thesis proposes a novel unified theory of object feature binding in which hierarchical feature analysis, spatial attention and temporal synchrony each play a role. It is further proposed that binding takes place in visual short-term memory through concerted and integrated information processing in distributed cortical areas. A cognitive model detailing this integrated proposal is given. Next, the cognitive model is used to inform the design and suggested implementation of a computational model which would be able to test the theory put forward in this thesis. In order to verify the model, future work is needed to implement the computational model. Thus it is argued that this doctoral thesis provides valuable experimental evidence concerning spatio-temporal aspects of the binding problem and as such is an <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> in the quest for a solution the object feature binding problem...|$|E
40|$|Public key {{encryption}} (PKE) is {{a fundamental}} cryptographic primitive {{with which we can}} communicate securely over possibly insecure network without shared secret information in advance. For PKE schemes, security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA security) is nowadays considered as a standard security notion needed in most practical applications/situations where PKE schemes are used. Roughly, CCA security captures security against "active" adversaries that can access to an imaginary machine called decryption oracle which on input a ciphertext returns a decryption result of it, and has been shown to imply important strong security notions such as non-malleability and universal composability. Therefore, studies on constructing and understanding CCA secure PKE schemes are important research topics in the area of cryptography. In this thesis, we focus on "generic constructions" of CCA secure PKE schemes from other cryptographic primitives, and make several contributions both from practical and theoretical points of view. Firstly, aiming at generic constructions that lead to CCA secure PKE schemes with practical efficiency, we focus on the so-called "IBE-to-PKE" transformation paradigm, where IBE stands for identity-based encryption and is a kind of PKE scheme where any string {{can be used as a}} public key. This is a methodology that transforms an IBE scheme which only satisfies security against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA security), the least requirement as an encryption scheme, into a CCA secure PKE scheme, and is the only known generic methodology with which we can construct CCA secure PKE schemes with practical efficiency. The biggest problem of this methodology is that the constructed PKE scheme has large ciphertext size, even if we use a practical IBE scheme as a building block. We propose two approaches to overcome this problem. The first approach is to require non-malleability, slightly stronger security than CPA security, for the underlying IBE scheme, and develop a new very simple IBE-to-PKE transformation where we only use one-way function, the weakest primitive used in the area of cryptography, as an <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> <b>block.</b> The second approach is to develop a new efficient encapsulation scheme, which is a special kind of commitment scheme and is a primitive used in one of the previous IBE-to-PKE transformations, from a special kind of pseudorandom generator. Both approaches do not need strong cryptographic primitives as additional building blocks, and lead to CCA secure PKE schemes with smaller ciphertext size than the previous IBE-to-PKE transformations. Secondly, we focus on the problem of whether it is possible to construct a CCA secure PKE scheme only from a CPA secure one. This is an important fundamental open problem that leads to clarifying a necessary and sufficient condition to realize a CCA secure PKE scheme. Regarding this problem, the best known positive results are the constructions of so-called bounded CCA secure schemes from any CPA secure PKE scheme, where bounded CCA security is security against adversaries that make at most the predetermined number of decryption queries, and thus is weaker than ordinary CCA security. Since we can achieve the best possible security in the bounded CCA security notions, in order to further tackle the fundamental problem, we need new security notions that capture intermediate security notions that lie between CPA and CCA security in a different sense from bounded CCA security. Motivated by this situation, in order to provide a theoretical foundation for further tackling the above problem, we focus on parallel decryption queries for an extension of bounded CCA security, and introduce a new security notion which we call "mixed CCA" security. It captures security against adversaries that make single and parallel decryption queries in a predetermined order, where each parallel query can contain unboundedly many ciphertexts. Moreover, how the decryption oracle is available before and after the challenge is also taken into account in this new security definition, which enables us to capture existing major security notions that lie between CPA and CCA security, including a complex notion like non-malleability against bounded CCA, in a unified security notion. We investigate the relations among mixed CCA security notions, and show a necessary and sufficient condition regarding implications/separations between any two notions in mixed CCA security. We then show two black-box constructions of PKE schemes from CPA secure ones, one of which satisfies a strictly stronger security notion than the security notions achieved by the existing constructions of PKE schemes constructed only from a CPA secure one. We also discuss the consequences of our results regarding security with parallel decryption queries and give several observations. 報告番号: 甲 27292; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(情報理工学); 学位記番号: 博情第 330 号; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|E

In this paper, we study a natural extension to the above document retrieval problem. We call this top-k frequent document retrieval, where instead of listing all documents containing P, our focus is to identify the top-k documents having most occurrences of P. This problem forms a basis for search engine tasks of retrieving documents ranked with TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) metric. A related problem was studied by Muthukrishnan (2002) where the emphasis was on retrieving all {{the document}}s whose number of occurrences of the pattern P exceeds some frequency threshold f.

In this contribution, two new poly(methyl methacrylate) polymers are introduced which can be cross-linked due to the attached benzyl azide (N 3) monomer units making the addition of hardeners or initiators obsolete. The synthesis of the copolymers as well as their successful characterization and usage as gate dielectrics for organic field-effect transistors is demonstrated. The investigated polymers have been labeled PAZ 12 and PAZ 14 according to their azide content in mol%. The <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of the polymers are methyl methacrylate for PAZ 12 and methyl methacrylate and styrene monomer units in about an equal ratio for PAZ 14. Spin-coated thin films were cross-linked by a thermal treatment at 110 °C followed by an UV exposure at a wavelength of 254 nm yielding insoluble, smooth and electrically dense polymeric networks. Optimal cross-linking parameters were obtained using infrared spectroscopy to follow the N 3 vibrational mode. Its disappearance confirms a complete cross-linking reaction, and thus fully reacted azide groups facilitate the analytics. The dielectric properties of the cross-linked thin films have been studied by impedance spectroscopy. The application of double layer dielectrics results in lower dielectric losses and lower leakage currents in the subsequently produced pentacene-based field-effect transistors. These devices operate at voltages below − 6 V and show hysteresis-free current–voltage characteristics with hole mobilities up to 0. 16 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1. PAZ 12 appears to be superior to PAZ 14 due to a lower total layer thickness of down to 92 nm still providing good insulation in the transistor presumably related to a lower free volume that arises in the cross-linked network of the two-component containing copolymer PAZ 12...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Drought {{is one of the major}} abiotic stresses which affect productivity in soybean. Plants respond and adapt to drought stress through various biochemical and physiological processes, and they induce several stress-responsive genes including osmolyte biosynthesis genes and transcription factors. To date, most of the abiotic stress-related genes have been constitutively expressed. Constitutive overexpression of a transgene requires <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> and energy, which may affect the normal growth of transgenic plants. The use of stress-inducible promoters can help express the gene under stress conditions and can also protect transgenic plants from growth suppression under non-stress conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana dehydration response element binding transcription factor (DREB 1 D) and three osmolyte genes driven by a constitutive, ABAinducible and stress-inducible promoters were introduced in soybean through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. Several transgenic lines were generated and molecular analysis was performed to confirm transgene integration. Transgenic plants overexpressing the AtDREB 1 D transcription factor showed reduced total leaf area and shoot biomass compared to non-transgenic plants under well-watered conditions. No significant difference in root length or root biomass was observed between transgenic and nontransgenic plants under well-watered conditions. When subjected to gradual water-deficit, transgenic plants maintained higher relative water content because the transgenic lines used water more slowly due to reduced total leaf area, which caused them to wilt slowler than nontransgenic plants. The transgenic plants showed improved drought tolerance by maintaining 17 - 24 % higher leaf cell membrane stability compared to non-transgenic plants. The results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering soybean for increased drought tolerance by expressing stress-responsive genes...|$|R

Major advances can reshape the way chemists approach the construction of challenging chemical bonds. In this work, we begin by describing the development of a catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five and seven-membered rings containing all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. Enantioselective Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative allylic alkylation reactions of β-ketoester substrates afforded a variety of chiral seven-membered α-quaternary vinylogous esters. Initial attempts to convert these compounds to γ-quaternary cycloheptenones led to the discovery of a two-carbon ring contraction reaction, which provided isomeric γ-quaternary acylcyclopentenes. Subsequent adjustment of reaction parameters provided divergent access to the originally targeted cycloheptenones. Numerous synthetic applications of the two versatile product types are demonstrated. The methodology expands on our previous investigations of six-membered ring scaffolds and provides <b>additional</b> chiral <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> for asymmetric total synthesis. The ring contraction approach to acylcyclopentenes was further developed in the total synthesis of the presilphiperfolanols, which are important intermediates in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Key to our synthetic route to the tricyclic core was the application of intramolecular Diels–Alder and Ni-catalyzed 1, 4 -hydroboration reactions. From these efforts, the enantioselective total synthesis of presilphiperfolan- 1 β-ol was achieved. Future research efforts seek to extend the synthetic route to presilphiperfolan- 9 α-ol and study the synthetic compounds in biomimetic carbocation rearrangement processes. </p...|$|R

To cover specific use cases, navigation systems and applications {{may be required}} to filter and aggregate data from different <b>building</b> <b>blocks,</b> e.g. from both Routing and Map Display in order to calculate a route and show it to the user.Each update region may contain data from multiple <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> Within a product database, which has several update regions, there may thus be several instances of the same <b>building</b> <b>block.</b> Example: In a Europe product database, there may be a Basic Map Display <b>building</b> <b>block</b> in the update region “France” and a Basic Map Display <b>building</b> <b>block</b> in the update region “Germany”.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A {{new kind}} of {{artifacts}} called intelligent artifacts was developed. These artifacts consist {{of a number of}} <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> with individual processing and communication. By assembling the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> into a structure, the user can develop both physical and functional structures. Hence, the user can be programming a behavior of the system by building a physical structure. Some <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> can be pure processing units, whereas other can include actuation or sensing. The processing in the individual <b>building</b> <b>block</b> can be arithmetic operations, behaviors in a behavior-based system, or similar. Here, the processing in the form of artificial neurons is introduced. Each <b>building</b> <b>block</b> is viewed as a neuron and the connections between <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> are viewed as synapses. By attaching <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> together, it is possible to make physical, artificial neural networks. ...|$|R
