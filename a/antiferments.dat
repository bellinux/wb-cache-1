40|$|In these {{experiments}} {{in which the}} lymph and serum ferments and antiferment have been studied separately, {{the changes that are}} found to occur are uniform and consistent. Possibly as a result of increased blood flow through the ferment-producing organs a moderate amount of protease is directly absorbed into the blood stream, but when intestinal digestion is actively under way this rapidly diminishes in extent. If any protease is absorbed during digestion from the gastrointestinal tract it is probably removed when it reaches the liver. The ereptase, or peptidase, is evidently absorbed directly from the intestinal tract and enters the circulation through the lymphatic channels. The influence of the diet on the antiferment of the lymph is striking and accounts for the fluctuations observed in previous experiments. Following the milk meal the increase occurs gradually in the lymph in an amount that, when diluted in the blood stream, would be only nominal. When the fats of the milk were replaced by olive oil in large amounts it is surprising to find a decrease in the antiferment instead of an increase in titer, as might be expected in view {{of the nature of the}} antiferment. This result, however, is probably due to the fact that the antiferment lipoids of the serum and lymph may exist in both water and fat dispersion phases, but are active as <b>antiferments</b> only when in the former. If the amount of the fats of the serum is increased, as it is after the olive oil feeding, more of the antiferment will enter the fat phase and will as a result be rendered inactive. When the feeding included the sodium oleate, the anti-ferment was in consequence increased in both the serum and the lymph, some of the soap being apparently absorbed directly into the blood stream. It is possible that the titer of the antiferment may be altered, therefore, by means of selective feeding...|$|E
40|$|Bürgers, Schermann, and Schreiber (1) studied "Auflösungserscheinungen von Bakterien," and {{concluded}} that ferments were probably not the main factor in such lysis. Kantorowicz (2) in studying <b>antiferment</b> and bacteriolysis came to the opinion {{that there was an}} <b>antiferment</b> in the bodies of bacteria which prevented digestion. This <b>antiferment</b> was likewise an antibody to serum bacteriolysins. But Kantorowicz used as a standard of ferment action merely the clearing up of the bacterial suspension. Our report shows that lysis of pneumococci may be independent of ferment action, and that it is not correct to assume that clearing up of a bacterial suspension even {{in the presence of a}} proteolytic ferment indicates proteolysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} of two phenomena {{involved in the}} mechanism of recovery following protein shock therapy is shown in these experiments {{to be due to}} changes that concern the lymph rather than the serum. The first of these, the increase in the rate of flow of the lymph, has been suggested by Teague and McWilliams as a possible factor in recovery from infection when due to bacteria proliferating in the lymph spaces and inaccessible to the antibodies of the serum (typhoid). By means of the protein shock, antibody-rich fluids (serum) are forced into the lymph channels. That the antibodies of the serum are augmented following the shock has been demonstrated by Culver (4). With this possibility in mind it is to be expected that bacterial infection not confined to the lymph spaces will not be influenced by shock therapy to the same extent. How far this holds true we are unable to state, although von Decastello (5) has called {{attention to the fact that}} while he was able to cause rapid lysis or a crisis in typhoid patients following the shock reaction, the injection of a similar amount of vaccine in typhus fever was without effect. The second factor, the great increase in the <b>antiferment,</b> is clearly due to the amount of the <b>antiferment</b> entering the general circulation through the lymph stream. This accounts for the marked fluctuations observed in the titer of the serum <b>antiferment</b> in patients following protein shock. If, for instance, the original titer of the lymph is less than that of the blood, the first flushing of the lymphatic current into the blood channel will tend to lower the titer of the serum, but with the increased amount in the lymph after the shock the titer of the serum will also increase. Bacteria proliferate best where the <b>antiferment</b> is absent, as Wright (6) has noted in his studies on war wounds, a fact that is also commonly applied in bacteriological technique when we employ ascitic fluids, containing relatively little <b>antiferment,</b> preferably to serum, in culture media. The increased lymph flow that follows the shock reaction would have value then, not only in forcing specific antibodies into the lymph channels, but 'in increasing the <b>antiferment</b> there as well, which would aid in checking the growth of bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{experimental}} (pre-clinic) study of the substance and the medicinal form of the country inhibitor of the proteolytic ferments "Ingiprol for injections" as the new pharmacological means. For the first time, the spectre and level of the <b>antiferment</b> activity of the new inhibitor proteinases have been characterized, the high inhibiting activity and the wide spectre of the <b>antiferment</b> substance activity have been revealed, {{the efficiency of the}} ingiprol with acute pancreatitis has been shown, the cytoprotective action has been revealed. As a result of the performed pre-clinic invvestigation, the permission for the performance of the clinic tests of Ingiprol has been obtained. On the base of the positive results of clinic tests, Ingiprol has been allowed for medical applicationAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|On May 11, 1954, a 4 -year old Hereford cow was {{admitted}} to the Stange Memorial Clinic with a history of having been bloated 3 to 4 days earlier. Although the cow had been punctured in the paralumbar fossa to relieve the bloat, she was bloated again at the time of entrance into the clinic. A stomach tube was passed to relieve the tympany. Magnesium sulfate and an <b>antiferment</b> were pumped into the rumen. On the following day 1 / 4 grain of eserine was injected subcutaneously. The stomach tube was passed daily for 3 days to relieve the recurring bloat but only small amounts of gas were obtained. On May 14, {{a great deal of the}} rumen ingesta was pumped out and the tympany was relieved. The animal was not eating well, although she was given gentian, ginger and nux vomica daily. Her appetite was slow in improving and she remained constipated...|$|R
