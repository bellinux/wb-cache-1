5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E

25|$|The {{high value}} which {{was set on}} the Barbara Gilmour cheese {{for the purpose of}} {{roasting}} was very much confined to Ayrshire, where a farl of oat cake or supple scone spread with roasted cheese, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of milk, or whey, or tea, or cold water, made a highly relished and substantial meal, precluding in many families the use of bacon for breakfast.|$|E
25|$|A real snake {{was used}} in the scene which showed one being cut, and was later used to make snake soup. This was because the {{production}} team could not afford a fake snake.

25|$|This was the 65th {{meeting between}} the teams with Nebraska clearly {{in control of the}} series 45–17–2 and 7–3 in the last 10. Nebraska went 8–4 last season and beat Colorado 30–3 in part of the tailspin of Colorado of the 2005 season. Colorado failed to prevent just its third 10-loss season in 117 years of intercollegiate {{football}} (going 1–10 in 1980 and 1984) as well as to end a 13-game losing streak to ranked teams. Nebraska had already captured the Big 12 North Division title <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> game yet to be determined. Colorado won’t be going to a bowl for just the fifth time since 1984, and this is just school’s fourth losing season in that time frame (1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006).|$|E
25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a large pot full of water <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E

Linebacker recruit Zayd Issah never enrolled at Penn State after several instances of legal trouble. Entering camp, Hackenberg and Ferguson vied for the starting quarterback position; ultimately, Hackenberg won the job, and Ferguson served as the backup.|$|E
500|$|In {{south-east}} Essex, Murrell {{was known}} as [...] "The Devil's Master", a title that he himself used as a self-description. He cultivated an air of mystery about himself by keeping himself largely apart from wider community life, speaking seldom, and traveling largely at night. His house was locally known as a [...] "place to avoid" [...] and those visiting him reportedly often waited for some time outside, plucking {{up the courage to}} enter. Within the cottage, Murrell had drying herbs hanging from his ceiling, and his devices were reported to include a crystal, a mirror, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of water. Other items that Murrell used in his magical practices were [...] a copper charm with which he would allegedly distinguish whether an individual was lying or not, and a [...] "trick" [...] telescope that supposedly enabled him [...] "to see through brick walls". The latter device was examined by an acquaintance of Murrell's, who deemed it to be [...] "a clumsily home-made arrangement of bits of looking-glass, such as might once have been bought at a toy-shop". Murrell possessed a library of books, including works on astrology and astronomy, conjuration, and medical texts. He also wrote a number of personal notebooks containing information on such topics, the last of which survived into at least the 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{collection}} of tobacco pipes included 15 complete clay pipes, 161 fragmentary pipes, two steatite pipes, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> of another. [...] The coloring of the clay pipes is from tan through dark brown to grayish black. [...] Most of the pipes had a polish on them that {{can still be}} seen, despite weathering damage. [...] This polish would completely obscure the paste texture of the pipe. [...] The most common decoration on these pipes was one that resembled rouletting and was probably made by a small stamp. [...] There are many sites in the surrounding area that have pipes {{very similar to the}} ones found at Potomac Creek. [...] Port Tobacco, Maryland, Moyaone, Pamunkey Reservation, and Keyser Farm Site all have similar to identical pipes as Potomac Creek.|$|E
