5|$|South African {{track and}} field athletes won a {{combined}} 17 medals at the Games, four gold, seven silver and six bronze. Sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who carried the nation's flag at the opening ceremony, was the most successful South African athlete winning individual gold in the T44 400 metres, gold in the 4×100 metres relay T42-46, setting world records in both, and individual silver in the T44 200 metres. In the 200 metres event Pistorius set a new world record in his heat, but he was defeated in the final by Brazilian Alan Oliveira. After the race Pistorius raised an issue <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Oliveira's blades, he later apologised for the timing of his remarks, but not the content of his complaint. The IPC confirmed the length of Oliveira’s blades were proportional to his body and legal, but expressed willingness to engage with Pistorius about the issue.|$|E
25|$|The timbre or {{tone quality}} of the guitalin can be {{described}} as a combination between a banjo and a mandolin, while the name of the instrument is derived from the combination of the names of the guitar and mandolin. The shape of the body of the instrument is an elongated trapezoid <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a standard guitar body.|$|E
25|$|In early 1906, Stevens made a bet with Kiuchi Jūshirō, a Japanese {{official}} {{resident in}} Korea, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time before Japan would annex Korea. Kiuchi expected {{it would only}} take three years; Stevens' guess of five years {{would prove to be}} more nearly correct, as the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty was signed in mid-1910. However, Stevens would not survive to see his prediction come true.|$|E

50|$|The postabdomen narrows distally, <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> {{which is}} equal to about 2.5 heights. It counts with setae natatoriae <b>about</b> 2.1-2.3 <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preanal portion of its postabdomen. Its antennule is long and narrow, nearly {{reaching}} {{the tip of the}} rostrum; the antennular seta is thin, <b>of</b> <b>about</b> half <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antennule. It exhibits nine terminal , the two longest being <b>about</b> 2/3 <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antennule itself. All the aesthetascs project beyond the anterior margin of the head shield. Seta arising from the basal segment of its endopodite are thin and shorter than the endopodite itself. It counts with 5 thoracic limbs.|$|R
50|$|Fused {{entirely to}} the sacrum is the pelvic girdle. The portion of the pelvic girdle {{in front of the}} femoral joint appears to consist of two unfused prepubes, which are longer than they are wide. The femur is {{slightly}} curved, and the femoral head and neck form an angle of <b>about</b> 150° with <b>the</b> shaft. On the lower leg, the relatively straight tibia is <b>about</b> 180% <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur; the fibula, which is <b>about</b> 45% <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tibia, is fused to it at both ends. Further below, the five metatarsals are rectangular. The second metatarsal is also the longest, followed again by the first and third, and then the fourth, with the third metatarsal being <b>about</b> 31% <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tibia. Unusually, the fifth digit of the foot still has two phalanges, the first straight and the second curved; <b>the</b> first is <b>about</b> 20% <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third metatarsal.|$|R
25|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late Second Temple period is less certain. One scholar has noted {{that there are no}} laws from Second Temple period sources that indicate any doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a month or of a year. This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them to know in advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{anal fin}} {{consists}} of one spine {{detached from the}} fin anteriorally, while the main fin has a single spine and 18 to 22 soft rays, with the last two detached to form a finlet like the dorsal fin. The dorsal and anal fins are quite low, and the dorsal fin is much longer than the anal. The pectoral fin is small for a carangid, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the pelvic fin and is non-falcate with 20 rays. The pelvic fin consists of one spine and five branched soft rays. The caudal fin is also highly diagnostic, being deeply forked and consisting of 17 caudal rays, 9 dorsally and 8 ventrally. The lateral line has a slight anterior arch {{and there are no}} scutes present on the line, but possesses about 100 scales. The scales covering the body and parts of the operculum, cheek, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and caudal fins are ctenoid in shape. The species has 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of anterograde amnesic syndromes {{varies with}} the extent of damage and the regions {{of the brain that}} were damaged. The most well-described regions indicated in this disorder are the medial temporal lobe (MTL), basal forebrain, and fornix. Beyond the details described below, the precise process of how we remember– on a micro scale– remains a mystery. Neuropsychologists and scientists are still not in total agreement over whether forgetting is due to faulty encoding, accelerated forgetting, or faulty retrieval, although a great deal of data seem to point to the encoding hypothesis. In addition, neuroscientists are also in disagreement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time involved in memory consolidation. Though most researchers, including Hasselmo et al., have found the consolidation process is spread out over several hours before transitioning from a fragile to a more permanent state, others, including Brown et al., posit that memory consolidation can take months or even years in a drawn-out process of consolidation and reinforcement. Further research into the length of time of memory consolidation will shed more light on why anterograde amnesia sometimes affects some memories gained after the event(s) that caused the amnesia, but does not affect other such memories.|$|E

25|$|In Mick's absence, Linda hires a new bar manager, Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) and {{agrees with}} Shirley {{to sell the}} Vic's {{freehold}} in order to solve their financial problems. Mick returns and walks in on Whitney and Woody in bed after having sex. He then punches Woody and throws him out. He later learns that Shirley and Linda sold the freehold of the Vic {{behind his back and}} forged his signature, and turns to alcohol to deal with the stress. He also learns that Max Branning (Jake Wood) set up the deal, and confronts him, branding him a snake and warning him to stay away from him. He then kisses a vulnerable Whitney who responds. Shirley learns of the kiss and tells Whitney to pack her bags and leave. When Mick learns that Shirley did this, he drunkenly throws a glass at her, but instantly regrets it and cries, saying he no longer knows himself. Mick tells Linda about the kiss on her return but is then left devastated when she tells him they're over. Later, Linda agrees to give it another go but when Mick admits he made a failed attempt to pay Whitney off with £200, it earns him a hard slap across the face from 'L'. Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) reveals her mum's suicide to Mick and when she tries to kiss him, he pushes her away. Following a reconciliation and Switzerland holiday, Mick leaves Linda for not revealing her cancer to him first and lying <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> her mum's illness. Next day they get back together.|$|E

[...] "Now I Lay Thee Down" [...] has a chorus Flynn describes as [...] "poppy" [...] and added [...] "fucked up lyrics" [...] about one person killing another, and then committing suicide. This was to make the song not suitable for airplay as the band wanted to make a [...] "dark epic record".|$|E

500|$|With {{the return}} of the series, Sathe {{explained}} that some of the show's writers had already worked with the EastEnders team on storylines for the characters they had created, and hoped this would continue as the E20 brand develops, and that the show would become a [...] "junior version" [...] of the BBC Writers Academy. Series 2 sees the introduction of street dance to the series to give it an [...] "authentic East End flavour of youth". The episodes were made all the same length following complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> episodes in the first series and the decision to show the series on BBC Three. Social networking site Twitter was also used to introduce teasers, with four of the characters having their own profiles.|$|E

500|$|The form of {{linguistic}} expression often does {{not correspond to}} the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, [...] "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> {{the arms of the}} one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.|$|E
500|$|In October {{that same}} year, a new pipe organ was inaugurated in Jørlunde church. Magle created its {{specifications}} and tonal design, after the old organ had perished {{in a fire}} five years earlier while in storage; he gave the instrument's inauguration concert on 8 November. In 2010 he released a double album of free improvisations on the Jørlunde-organ, Like a Flame. Reviews of the album were predominantly favorable, described in MusicWeb International as [...] "highly creative, sometimes visionary, [...] surprisingly unpompous", but a scathing review in the Danish organ magazine ORGLET argued for traditional fugal and choral forms instead of free improvisation. One critic complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the album, finding it too long at more than two hours. The organist, jazz-pianist, and composer Henrik Sørensen defended Magle's free improvisational form {{in an article in}} Danish organ-magazine Orgelforum.|$|E
500|$|Dromaeosaurids, {{especially}} Deinonychus, {{are often}} depicted as unusually fast-running {{animals in the}} popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that Deinonychus was fleet-footed in his original description. However, when first described, a complete leg of Deinonychus had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the femur (upper leg bone) later proved {{to have been an}} overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern fleet-footed birds, like the ostrich, the foot-tibia ratio is [...]95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs, like Struthiomimus, the ratio is [...]68, but in Deinonychus the ratio is [...]48. Ostrom stated that the [...] "only reasonable conclusion" [...] is that Deinonychus was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.|$|E

500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E
500|$|EastEnders: E20 {{was filmed}} {{on the same}} set as EastEnders, using three {{handheld}} cameras {{to give it a}} more [...] "edgy" [...] feel compared to EastEnders, which is filmed with cameras on tripods. Director Michael Keillor stated that although using handheld cameras is normally easier, the fact it was shot with a multiple-camera setup made it more challenging and created problems for the lighting and props teams as nobody knew exactly where the camera would be. Keillor said it was a [...] "particularly tough day" [...] when filming a party scene in a flat, as normally walls of the set would be removed but all the walls were left in to make it look more realistic, meaning the crew overheated. Series 1 was filmed over ten days with approximately 120 minutes of television being shot. Each of the first series' 12 episodes are between three and 16 minutes in length. The second series features 10 episodes averaging 14 minutes each, which was a response to complaints from viewers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> some of the episodes in series 1. Series 3 began production in May 2011, and took about four weeks to film.|$|E
