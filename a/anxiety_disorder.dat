5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (GAD) or social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{epidemiological}} survey findings, <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> are the most prevalent mental disorders {{around the world and}} are associated with significant comorbidity and morbidity. Such surveys rely on advances in psychiatric nosology and may also contribute usefully to revisions of the nosology. There are a number of questions at the intersection of psychiatric epidemiology and nosology. This review addresses the following: What is the prevalence of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and how do we best explain cross-national differences in prevalence estimates? What are the optimal diagnostic criteria for <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> and how can epidemiological data shed light on this question? What are the comorbidities of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> and how do we best understand the high comorbidities seen in these conditions? What is the current treatment gap for <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> and {{what are the implications of}} current understandings of psychiatric epidemiology and nosology for policy-making relevant to <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders?</b> Here, we emphasize that <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> are the most prevalent of the psychiatric conditions, and that rather than merely contrasting cross-national prevalence in <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> it is more productive to delineate cross-national themes that emerge about the epidemiology of these conditions. We discuss that optimizing diagnostic criteria for <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> is an iterative process to which epidemiological data can make a crucial contribution. Additionally, high comorbidity in <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> is not merely artefactual; it provides key opportunities to explore pathways to mental disorders and to intervene accordingly.

5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (GAD) {{may take}} up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E

However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder)</b> or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety.

5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E

Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

40|$|This review aims {{to address}} issues unique to older adults with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in order to inform {{potential}} changes in the DSM-V. Prevalence and symptom expression of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in late life, as well as risk factors, comorbidity, cognitive decline, age of onset, and treatment efficacy for older adults are reviewed. Overall, the current literature suggests: (a) <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> are common among older age individuals, but less common than in younger adults; (b) overlap exists between anxiety symptoms of younger and older adults, {{although there are some}} differences as well as limitations to the assessment of symptoms among older adults; (c) <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> are highly comorbid with depression in older adults; (d) <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> are highly comorbid with a number of medical illnesses; (e) associations between cognitive decline and anxiety have been observed; (f) late age of onset is infrequent; and (g) both pharmacotherapy and CBT have demonstrated efficacy for older adults with anxiety.

5|$|<b>Anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> {{and major}} {{depressive}} disorder {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This article {{reviews the}} {{clinical}} and epidemiological aspects of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in youngsters, {{as well as}} current medical and psychological treatment strategies. The role of the neurobiological models possibly involved in the etiology of these disorders is also discussed. Sources of data: MEDLINE search of papers published in English from 1981 to 2003. The following key words were used: <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> neurobiology, childhood, adolescence. Summary of the findings: Childhood-onset <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> {{are among the most}} frequent psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Epidemiological data estimate a prevalence of 10 % in this population. The neurobiological models involved in the etiology of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in youngsters are closely related to neuroimaging studies with individuals presenting these pathologies. The role of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of these disorders is underscored. To be effective, treatment must combine several interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral, family, and, frequently, drug treatments. Conclusions: Early identification and prompt treatment of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> may prevent negative consequences, such as school absenteeism and frequent and unnecessary visits to pediatric services due to somatic complaints related to <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Moreover, it is possible that psychiatric problems could be avoided or attenuated in adulthood.

40|$|Research {{with adults}} {{suggests}} that anxiety {{is associated with}} poor control of executive attention. However, in children, it is unclear (a) whether <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and non-clinical <b>anxiety</b> are associated with deficits in executive attention, (b) whether such deficits are specific to anxiety versus other psychiatric disorders, and (c) whether there is heterogeneity among <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (in particular, specific phobia versus other <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders).</b> We examined executive attention in 860 children classified into three groups: <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (n = 67), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 67) and no psychiatric disorder (n = 726). <b>Anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> were subdivided into: <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> excluding specific phobia (n = 43) and specific phobia (n = 21). The Attention Network Task {{was used to assess}} executive attention, alerting and orienting. Findings indicated heterogeneity among <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> as children with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (excluding specific phobia) showed impaired executive attention, compared with disorder-free children, whereas children with specific phobia showed no executive attention deficit. Among disorder-free children, executive attention was less efficient in those with high, relative to low, levels of anxiety. There were no anxiety-related deficits in orienting or alerting. Children with ADHD not only had poorer executive attention than disorder-free children, but also higher orienting scores, less accurate responses and more variable response times. Impaired executive attention in children (reflected by difficulty inhibiting processing of task-irrelevant information) was not fully explained by general psychopathology, but instead showed specific associations with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (other than specific phobia) and ADHD, as well as with high levels of anxiety symptoms in disorder-free children...|$|R
