5|$|The early stories present Valérian as {{a typical}} square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and {{dependable}} (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In World Without Stars (Le Pays sans étoile), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in On the False Earths (Sur les terres truquées), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> while in Heroes of the Equinox (Les Héros de l'Equinoxe), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in Heroes of the Equinox and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos.|$|E

25|$|High-pass filters {{have many}} applications. They {{are used as}} part of an audio {{crossover}} to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else).</b>|$|E
25|$|Differential braking (or braked differential) systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else,</b> producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|E

25|$|Photo{{ionization}} (PI) was {{a method}} that was first applied as an ionization method to detecting gases separated by GC. Years later, it was also applied as a detector for LC, though the samples must be vaporized first to be detected by the photoionization detector. Eventually PI was applied to mass spectrometry, particularly as an ionization method for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sample preparation for PI includes first ensuring the sample is in the gas phase. PI ionizes molecules by exciting the sample molecules with photons of light. This method only works if the sample and other components in the gas phase are excited by different wavelengths of light. It is important when preparing the sample, or photon source, that the wavelengths of ionization are adjusted to excite the sample analyte <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

Górecki himself recalled that, at the premiere, he sat next to a [...] "prominent French musician" [...] (Górecki did not name names, though it was probably Pierre Boulez), who, after hearing the twenty-one repetitions of an A-major chord at the end of the symphony, loudly exclaimed [...] "Merde!" ...|$|E
500|$|The medieval chronicler Bede {{described}} Mellitus {{as being}} of noble birth. In letters, Pope Gregory I called him an abbot, {{but it is}} unclear whether Mellitus had previously been abbot of a Roman monastery, or this was a rank bestowed on him to ease his journey to England by making him the leader of the expedition. The papal register, a listing of letters sent out by the popes, describes him as an [...] "abbot in Frankia" [...] in its description of the correspondence, but the letter itself only says [...] "abbot".
