5|$|Gibbs' first Test century, 211 not out, {{was made}} against New Zealand at the AMI Stadium, Christchurch, in March 1999. His highest score of 228 came against Pakistan at the Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town in 2003. These two {{are the only}} {{instances}} of his scoring <b>above</b> <b>200.</b> In Tests, Gibbs scored centuries against all Test-playing teams except Sri Lanka. In ODIs, Gibbs scored centuries against 10 different teams, including all nine Test-playing teams. On 6 February 2005, he became only the second batsman, after Australia's Ricky Ponting, to score an ODI century against all Test playing nations, when he scored 100 against England. Gibbs also played 23 Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) for South Africa between 2005 and 2010. He did not score any centuries in the format; his best score of 90 not out came against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds <b>above</b> <b>200</b> knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, 1808, Taylor {{joined the}} U.S. Army, {{receiving}} a commission {{as a first}} lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment. He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress {{in response to the}} Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war. Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs. Under the command of James Wilkinson, the soldiers at Terre aux Boeufs suffered greatly from disease and lack of supplies, and Taylor was given an extended leave, returning to Louisville to recover. Taylor was promoted to captain in November 1810. His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances. Over the next several years, he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville. He bought a plantation in Louisville for $95,000 that had 83 slaves attached to it, as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, bringing the total number of slaves under him <b>above</b> <b>200.</b> In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory, where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled. In only a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison. Taylor was temporarily called to Washington to testify for Wilkinson as a witness in a court-martial, and so he did not take part in the November 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe against the forces of Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief.|$|E

25|$|The tournament {{featured}} five teams, {{the same}} as at the preceding 2003 edition, and the same format was used, a simple round-robin. The United States finished the tournament undefeated to win its first title, and consequently qualified for the 2006 Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka. The team had nearly been barred from playing, as part of proposed International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctions against the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) for maladministration, but the situation was resolved the month before the tournament. Canada was the runner-up at the championship, with the Cayman Islands placing third, Bermuda fourth, and Argentina placing last, again finishing winless. The tournament was affected by rain, with two matches being abandoned and another shortened. A feature of the championship was its low scoring, with only four innings <b>above</b> <b>200</b> being recorded from the ten matches played. The tournament's leading runscorer, Canadian batsman Trevin Bastiampillai, was the only player to record more than 100 runs, while the leading wicket-taker was American bowler Abhimanyu Rajp, who took two five-wicket hauls.|$|E
25|$|Middlesex {{defeated}} fellow title challengers Durham {{within three}} days in a low-scoring match in which neither side posted a score <b>above</b> <b>200.</b> Sussex lost their second consecutive Championship game, this time against relegation-battling Derbyshire, who took their first win of the season, and their first victory at Hove for seventeen years. The prevalence of heavy rain thwarted any hopes of a result in the matches between Somerset and Nottinghamshire, and Yorkshire and Warwickshire. Derbyshire's hopes of survival were boosted by a win against Middlesex, whose title ambitions were dented, while a draw for Warwickshire at home to Somerset left their hopes of retaining the Championship increasingly slim. Meanwhile, Yorkshire defeated Nottinghamshire to take their sixth victory of the season, strengthening their lead {{at the top of}} the table, while at Chester-le-Street, an emphatic victory for Durham over Surrey ensured that Yorkshire's position was not left unchallenged. Yorkshire, with four games remaining had 181 points, while Durham, with an additional game yet to play, were 25.5 points behind the leaders. In the relegation battle, two points separated seventh-placed Derbyshire and eighth-placed Somerset, while Surrey, albeit with a game in hand, were a further thirteen points back in last place.|$|E
