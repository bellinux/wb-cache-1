5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before his death, Goldstein's {{behavior}} had been erratic <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> missing appointments. His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E
5|$|Robson's {{success with}} Ipswich had {{attracted}} the attention of many bigger clubs, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> linked with the Manchester United job when Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to Ron Atkinson instead. It was the Football Association who lured Robson away from Portman Road a year later, when he accepted their offer to manage the England national team in July 1982.|$|E

5|$|Smith was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general and also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in January 1944. On 18 January, he set out for London with {{two and a half}} tons of personal baggage loaded onto a pair of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. The staff of the Chief-of-Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC) was already active, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> planning the Overlord operation for some time.|$|E
5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had {{died when he was}} eight <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, was quick to learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most of the militia regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and had taken command of the militia. Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force, in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E

5|$|Minsk was liberated by the Soviet 1st and 3rd Belorussian Fronts on 3 July, but Model still {{hoped to}} re-establish {{the front to}} the west of the city, with the aid of {{divisions}} from Army Groups North and North Ukraine. However, German strength was unequal to the task, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> driven out of Vilnius and Baranovichi by 8 July. At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been uncommitted thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed to hold the line east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the steady flow of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet penetrations of its front. Model stopped the Red Army's advance just short of Warsaw by 3 August, setting up a continuous front from south of Shaulyay to the right boundary on the Vistula near Pulawy.|$|E
5|$|Overton {{was told}} {{he would not be}} given the decorations he had earned in Korea, {{including}} the awards from his previous tour which had not yet been written up. Overton had twice been pinned with a Distinguished Flying Cross personally by Fifth Air Force commander Lieutenant General Glenn O. Barcus, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> considered for several Silver Star Medals. Overton was also given a bad efficiency report which characterized him as insubordinate. Overton lost his temporary rank of captain. The military delayed official recognition of his credits and ace status until December 1953. He became one of 40 US aces during the war. Overton resigned his commission before the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The company {{established}} a defensive {{position for the}} night. While they were doing so, Lieutenant D. B. Stuart, the commander {{of one of the}} Papuan platoons, arrived. They had become concerned when radio contact had been lost <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sent {{to find out what was}} going on. King ordered him to bring the Papuans up from Sangan with extra ammunition and the No.11 set. At around 17:30, a native appeared with a message for the Japanese commander. The paper was taken from him and he was shot when he tried to escape. Later, a Japanese patrol returned to Kaiapit, unaware that it was now in Australian hands. They were killed when they stumbled across a Bren gun position. Four more Japanese soldiers returned after midnight. One of them escaped.|$|E

5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them {{in more ways than}} one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in the}} Tariff of 1842, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E
5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling {{that he might be}} on the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
