Modern systematics <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the}} questions about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

The BBC responded, [...] "EastEnders <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities." [...] In a report to the BBC’s Board of Governors in July 2004 regarding religion, Dot was used as an example of how religion can be portrayed as stereotypical [...] "out-of-date and occasionally offensive" [...] in drama and entertainment output, that Christian figures are highlighted because of their faith [...] "rather than seen as normal people who also have a religious belief".
