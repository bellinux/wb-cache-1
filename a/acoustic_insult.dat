40|$|Inner ear epithelia {{of mature}} birds {{regenerate}} hair cells after ototoxic or <b>acoustic</b> <b>insult.</b> The lack of markers that selectively label cells in regenerating epithelia and of culture systems composed primarily of progenitor cells has hampered {{the identification of}} cellular and molecular interactions that regulate hair cell regeneration. In control basilar papillae, we identified two markers that selectively label hair cells (calmodulin and TUJ 1 � tubulin antibodies) and one marker unique for support cells (cytokeratin antibodies). Examination of regenerating epithelia demonstrated that calmodulin and � tubulin are also expressed in early differentiating hair cells, and cytokeratins are retained in proliferative support cells. Enzymatic and mechanical methods were used to isolate sensory epithelia from mature chick basilar papillae, and epithelia were cultured in different conditions. In control cultures, hair cells are morphologically stable for up t...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{overstimulation}} {{can lead}} to sensory cell (hair cell) loss in the auditory epithelium. Damaged hair cells in the organ of Corti (the mammalian auditory end-organ) degenerate and are replaced by non-sensory cells (supporting cells) which construct an irreversible scar. In birds, however, auditory hair cells which are damaged by acoustic trauma or ototoxic drugs may be replaced by new hair cells. As first step in determining the mechanism of hair cell regeneration, we developed an assay for cell divisions in the auditory epithelium after acoustic trauma. The results of these experiments demonstrate that supporting cells in damaged regions of the auditory epithelium incorporate the DNA-specific marker bromodeoxyuridine as early as one day after noise exposure. We provide direct evidence that following <b>acoustic</b> <b>insult</b> to the avian inner ear, supporting cells which reside within the sensory epithelium divide near the luminal surface and repopulate the epithelium. These results suggest that supporting cells participate in scar formation during hair cell degeneration, and produce new cells for regeneration...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Otologic injury {{associated}} with fatal and nonfatal lightning strikes has been sporadically {{reported in the}} literature. The most common <b>acoustic</b> <b>insult</b> is a conductive hearing loss secondary to rupture of the tympanic membrane. Although conjecture {{has been made of}} the theoretic possibility of ossicular injury from lightning strike, to our knowledge, none has been demonstrated intraoperatively or postmortem. We report the first documented case of ossicular disruption in a lightning-strike victim. Lightning strikes can produce an array of clinical symptomsand injuries. Indeed, lightning strikes are seldom fatal; the majority of victims survive with various degrees of injury. There is frequently a delay in the detection of audiovestibular sequelae, the most common of which is tympanic membrane rupture. Review of the literature relating to lightning-induced neuro-otologic injury revealed no documented case of ossic-ular disruption despite reports of cases of middle ear explor-atory surgery and postmortem temporal bone dissection. We present a case of ossicular chain damage in a lightning-injured patient confirmed on imaging and discuss some of the patho...|$|E
50|$|Human hearing extends in {{frequency}} from 20-20,000 Hz, and in amplitude from 0 dB to 130 dB or more. 0 dB {{does not represent}} absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to -5 or even -10 dB. 130 dB represents the threshold of pain. But the ear doesn't hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000 Hz. There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and amplitude that can't easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normative hearing is defined by a frequency versus amplitude graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies. Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other <b>acoustic</b> <b>insults,</b> 'typical' hearing may not be normative.|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} new technologies for the detection and defeat of energetic materials, this collection of work was focused on using simulations to characterize materials at extremes of temperature, pressure and radiation. Each branch of the work here is collected by which material response is potentially used as the detectable signal. ^ Where the chemical response is of interest, this work will explore the possibility of non-statistical chemical reactions in condensed-phase energetic materials via reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterize the response of three unique high energy density molecular crystals to different means of energy input: electric fields of various frequencies (100 − 4000 cm− 1) and strengths, and direct heating at various rates. It was found that non-equilibrium states can be created for short timescales when the energy input targets specific vibrations through the electric fields, and that equilibration eventually occurs even when the insults remain present. Interestingly, for strong fields these relaxation timescales are {{comparable to those of}} the initial chemical decomposition of the molecules. On similar timescales, we have studied the relaxation process of shock compressed molecules. Details of how energy localization, either from these vibrational or mechanical insults, affects the preferred uni- or multi-molecular reactions are discussed. These results provide insight into non-equilibrium or coherent initiation of chemistry in the condensed phase that would be of interest in fields ranging from catalysis to explosives. ^ Without initiating reactions, the thermal response of a material subject to a mechanical stimulus can be used to inform on the chemical characteristics. Here MD simulations are performed to study how energy from an acoustic wave is localized in a composite material of a polymer and molecular crystal. Insight is provided on how the interface between these to materials will affect which component absorbs and localizes this insult energy. Furthermore these results provide an explanation to anomalous experimental results that subject similar composites to <b>acoustic</b> <b>insults.</b> ^ In parallel efforts for the detection and defeat of explosives, we study the scattering of electromagnetic waves in anisotropic energetic materials. Nonlinear light-matter interactions in molecular crystals result in frequency-conversion and polarization changes. Applied electromagnetic fields of moderate intensity can induce these nonlinear effects without triggering chemical decomposition, offering a mechanism for non-ionizing identification of explosives. We use molecular dynamics simulations to compute such two-dimensional THz spectra for planar slabs made of PETN and ammonium nitrate. We discuss third-harmonic generation and polarization-conversion processes in such materials. These observed far-field spectral features of the reflected or transmitted light may serve as an alternative tool for stand-off explosive detection. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent surge of {{interest}} in the development of animal models of hyperacusis, a condition in which tolerance to sounds of moderate and high intensities is diminished. The reasons for this decreased tolerance are likely multifactorial, but some major factors that contribute to hyperacusis are increased loudness perception and heightened sensitivity and/or responsiveness to sound. Increased sound sensitivity is a symptom that sometimes develops in human subjects after <b>acoustic</b> <b>insult</b> and has recently been demonstrated in animals as evidenced by enhancement of the acoustic startle reflex following acoustic over-exposure. However, different laboratories have obtained conflicting results in this regard, with some studies reporting enhanced startle, others reporting weakened startle, and still others reporting little, if any, change in the amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex following noise exposure. In an effort to gain insight into these discrepancies, we conducted measures of acoustic startle responses (ASR) in animals exposed to different levels of sound, and repeated such measures on consecutive days using a range of different startle stimuli. Since many studies combine measures of acoustic startle with measures of gap detection, we also tested ASR in two different acoustic contexts, one in which the startle amplitudes were tested in isolation, the other in which startle amplitudes were measured {{in the context of the}} gap detection test. The results reveal that the emergence of chronic hyperacusis-like enhancements of startle following noise exposure is highly reproducible but is dependent on the post-exposure thresholds, the time when the measures ar...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} tinnitus research lies in explaining how <b>acoustic</b> <b>insult</b> leads to tinnitus in some individuals, but not others. One possibility is genetic {{variability in the}} expression and function of neuromodulators – components of neural signalling that alter the balance of excitation and inhibition in neural circuits. An example is nitric oxide (NO) – a free radical and potent neuromodulator in the mammalian brain – that regulates plasticity via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Changes in NO have previously been implicated in tinnitus generation, specifically in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). Here, we examined nitric oxide synthase (NOS) – the enzyme responsible for NO production – in the guinea pig VCN following acoustic trauma. NOS was present in most cell types – including spherical and globular bushy cells, small, medium and large multipolar cells, and octopus cells – spanning the entire extent of the VCN. The staining pattern was symmetrical in control animals. Unilateral acoustic over-exposure (AOE) resulted in marked asymmetries between ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the VCN {{in terms of the}} distribution of NOS across the cochlear nuclei in animals with behavioural evidence of tinnitus: fewer NOS-positive cells and a reduced level of NOS staining was present across the whole extent of the contralateral VCN, relative to the ipsilateral VCN. The asymmetric pattern of NOS-containing cells was observed as early as one day after AOE and was also present in some animals at 3, 7 and 21 days after AOE. However it was not until eight weeks after AOE, when tinnitus had developed, that asymmetries were significant overall, compared with control animals. Asymmetrical NOS expression was not correlated with shifts in the threshold hearing levels. Variability in NOS expression between animals may represent one underlying difference that can be linked to whether or not tinnitus develops after noise exposure...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{hair cells}} are the {{specialized}} mechanosensory receptors found in vertebrate auditory, vestibular, and lateral line organs that transduce vibratory and acoustic stimuli into the sensations of hearing and balance. Hair cells can be damaged due to {{such factors as}} aging, ototoxic chemicals, acoustic trauma, infection, or genetic factors. Loss of these hair cells lead to deficits in hearing and balance, and in mammals, such deficits are permanent. In contrast, non-mammalian vertebrates exhibit the capability to regenerate missing hair cells. Researchers have been examining the process of hair cell death and regeneration in animal models {{in an attempt to}} find ways of either preventing hair cell loss or stimulating the production of new hair cells in mammals, with the ultimate goal of finding new therapeutics for human sensorineural hearing and balance deficits. This has led to a wide array of research on sensory hair cells- such as understanding the factors that cause hair cell loss and finding agents that protect them from damage, elucidating the cell signaling pathways activated during hair cell death, examining the genes and cellular pathways that are regulated during the process of hair cell death and regeneration, and characterizing the functional sensory loss and recovery following <b>acoustic</b> or ototoxic <b>insults</b> to the inner ear. This research has involved cell and developmental biologists, physiologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians, and otolaryngologists. In this Research Topic, we have collated reviews of the past progress of hair cell death and regeneration studies and original research articles advancing sensory hair cell death and regeneration research into the future...|$|R
