The early precipitation of a hydrated phase is proposed as an intermediate phase before transformation into calcite. Thermodynamic modeling in conjunction with pH, surface potential measurements, and colloidal stability modeling demonstrate that calcite growth is dominated by agglomeration. This is in agreement with the cryogenic TEM observations, which suggest oriented attachment dominates early aggregation. The final stage of the reaction is described by a ripening mechanism that is significantly inhibited when high concentrations of polyacrylic acid (PAA) are used.
