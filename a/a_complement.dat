5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with <b>a</b> <b>complement</b> of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} week of March, the {{battalion}} finally withdrew to refit with the M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyer. In so doing, it reverted to the old self-propelled battalion organisation; three companies of twelve tank destroyers, plus a fourth reconnaissance company with a platoon of pioneers. The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with <b>a</b> <b>complement</b> of 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing <b>a</b> <b>complement</b> of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E

The newly added Staffel 7./JG 51 (later 8./JG 1) was attacked by Mustangs near Le Mans, Lt. Johann Brünnler being shot down and killed.

5|$|The Tripolitan vessel, Tripoli, and Enterprise {{were quite}} evenly matched. Enterprise, with <b>a</b> <b>complement</b> of 90, was a 12-gun, 135-ton {{schooner}} built in 1799 that had seen {{action in the}} Quasi-War. In contrast, Tripoli, a lateen-rigged polacca with two masts, was crewed by 80men under Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous and armed with 14guns. Although the Tripolitans held a slight advantage in firepower, Enterprise had to its advantage the larger crew and the element of surprise. The Americans were also significantly more experienced in gunnery action than the Tripolitans, who preferred to attack by boarding and taking over their opponents' ships.|$|E

5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in <b>a</b> <b>complement</b> clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was to have had <b>a</b> <b>complement</b> of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an {{anti-aircraft}} battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in dual mounts, ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in dual mounts, and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts. Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war.
