5|$|The hurst {{of trees}} with a {{representation}} of the Pole Star above are <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the name Northwood. The mitre and fleurs-de-lys refer to the Abbey of Bec Herlewin in Normandy, to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted, where there was a cell of the Order. The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the name Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the subject of Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Harry {{obtained}} a place at Liverpool's College of Art at 68 Hope Street. After studying typography and page layouts, he borrowed the college's duplicating machine and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958, which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club, the Temple Jazz Club and the Cavern Club. He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments. The title was suggested by the owner, Frank Hesselberg, as <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> his own comments, but was abandoned after a few issues.|$|E

5|$|Beauty Revealed was {{completed}} {{during a period}} of popularity of portrait miniatures, a medium which had been introduced in the United States in the late 18th century. By the time Goodridge completed her self-portrait, miniatures were increasing in complexity and vibrance. The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History describes Beauty Revealed as <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in England and France, but not common in the US. Such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing the sitters' identities.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{character}} and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not ready for use at that time. Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, {{who played}} Paul McCartney's fictional {{grandfather}} John McCartney, was already well-known to British audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke {{that he was}} so clean reflects <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> his sitcom role, where he was always referred to as a dirty old man. In other roles, Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin played the group's road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director. Brian Epstein, the group's real manager, had an uncredited bit part.|$|E

5|$|On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{received}} broadly {{good reviews}} in the British and American press. The novel was adapted {{to run as}} a three-part story in Playboy in 1963 {{and then as a}} daily comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper in 1964–1965. In 1969 the novel was adapted as the sixth film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series and was the only film to star George Lazenby as Bond. In 2014 On Her Majesty's Secret Service was adapted as <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> BBC Radio, starring Toby Stephens.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} she entered some failed {{business}} ventures, including in 1988 a perfume named Woman (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon's—at 13/14 Upper St. Martin's Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu items such as Rubber Sole (<b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as Sgt. Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a short life as a business venture, as it {{was considered to be}} far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts on the men in her life encouraging her.|$|E

The Surly Griffins won their first bout in the 2011 season when they defeated the Red Bellied Black Hearts.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{has several}} {{references}} to Christmas films. The title is <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> Miracle on 34th Street while {{the scene where}} everyone rallies around to support the Simpsons {{is reminiscent of the}} last scene of the classic holiday movie It's a Wonderful Life. The film is further spoofed when Homer tells Lisa to stop playing the piano which parodies a similar scene involving George Bailey.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until they discovered that another band had already used it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for Four Sides to the Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> {{the title of the}} Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E

5|$|Well-known screenwriter Lillie Hayward, and {{newcomer}} Roberta Hodes, {{were hired}} {{to adapt the}} novel for film. They combined several of the stories from the novel, modifying characters to create a single flowing narrative. For example, the crippled girl who was a neighbor girl in the original novel became Glure's daughter. Noting Terhune's frequent disdain for the Ramapough Mountain Indians, they named the film's villain Jackson White, <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> the nickname {{used to refer to}} those people. White became the catch all villain of the film, who poaches deer, sets fire to the Tremayne barn, and break into the house to try to steal a gold trophy won by Lad.|$|E
5|$|Youthanasia is {{the sixth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on November 1, 1994 through Capitol Records. The album {{is not a}} large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings; however it marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following {{the footsteps of the}} previous album Countdown to Extinction (1992). The album's title is <b>a</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth. The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline; the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track.|$|E
