40|$|Abstract — This article {{describes}} {{a method to}} track 3 D <b>articulated</b> <b>structures</b> from a monocular perspective image sequence using a particle filter. This structure is composed {{of a set of}} linked degenerated quadrics (cones) which are truncated by pairs of planes also modelled as degenerated quadrics. This set of truncated cones is connected by joints containing one or more degrees of freedom. The method is based upon the estimation of the contours of the structure’s silhouette projected on the image plane, to validate each of the particles which correspond to proposed configurations. This validation is performed using a criterion that combines a measure based on the contours, a measure of similarity between the colour distribution around a point on the structure and a reference distribution, and other criteria that reinforce the overall cost function. The results show the feasibility of the approach when using a single camera to track a 3 D model containing eight degrees of freedom.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the design and}} implementation of an extensible objectoriented physics engine framework. The design and implementation consolidates concepts from the wide literature {{in the field and}} clearly documents the procedures and methods. Two primary dynamic behaviors are explored: rigid body dynamics and articulated dynamics. A generalized collision response model is built for rigid bodies and <b>articulated</b> <b>structures</b> which can be adapted to other types of behaviors. The framework is designed around the use of interfaces for modularity and easy extensibility. It supports both a standalone physics engine and a supplement to a distributed immersive rendering environment. We present our results as a number of scenarios that demonstrate the viability of the framework. These scenarios include rigid bodies and <b>articulated</b> <b>structures</b> in free-fall, collision with dynamic and static bodies, resting contact, and friction. We show that we can effectively combine different dynamics into one cohesive structure. We also explain how we can efficiently extend current behaviors to develop new ones, such as altering rigid bodies to produce different collision responses or flocking behavior. Additionally, we demonstrate these scenarios in both the standalone and the immersive environment...|$|R

50|$|Vesely {{seems to}} confer a {{projective}} ability on spatiality that is thus knowable {{from its own}} potential to generate a situation. According to Vesely, the continuity of reference to ground exists within a permanent tension with the actual space, a continuity which under certain conditions may be disrupted and even destroyed (pp. 55-56). The {{fact that there are}} discrepancies between different levels of representation should perhaps be no surprise as it is the case of the above-mentioned examples of reading a map, or orienting oneself in a space under zero gravity. That there is discrepancy between the given representation of a space and the actual space is in fact a common datum of everyday experience. The question is not to be solved, although it may constitute one important point of departure to understand the phenomenon of representation. This is particularly the case of extreme conditions where the phenomenon of 'continuity' is no longer recognizable. In the cases of aphasia and apraxia, which rank among others of what is generally known as mental blindness, there is a blatant discontinuity between the possibilities of notional understanding and the actual performance of a purposive act or standard articulation of speech. The work and research that has been carried out on mental blindness tends to show that the ability to articulate both speech and purposive actions and gestures is nonetheless affected by the surrounding environment, and is not based upon mental impairment alone. On the contrary, it has become increasingly clear that such conditions do not take place solely as a result of mental functions; neither can they be enacted by the situational structure, as both contribute to the failure and success of treatment (p. 57). Vesely brings the argument about these conditions back to the experiments regarding orientation, such as the inverted vision experiment and orientation under zero gravity conditions, and correlates it with the problems experienced with mental blindness. This is because of the fundamental knowledge of spatiality that is at stake that enables a possible representation to be actually effected. As regards spatiality, Vesely presupposes an existing continuity between the possible and the actual spatial configuration, as a mediated structure (p. 58). This understanding of representation seems to reverberate Husserl's phenomenological treatment of representation, as moving from the horizon of vague, informal representation (Vorstellung), through a number of possibilities (Vergegenwärtigungen), until it finally reaches actuality (Repräsentation). The fact that Husserl only used the word Repräsentation to deal with explicit forms of representation, may serve us {{as an example of how}} a whole representational process was being kept in the background. Husserl's process of representation shows that our knowledge of spatiality intakes different levels of articulation, which are not always as clearly defined as we would wish. This means that the ground and point of departure of explicit references is not a point of departure towards a growing, cumulative knowledge of situation, but is rather a 'coming back' into a prereflective world of experience. In this sense, representation takes place as a spectrum ranging out of explicit forms of articulation into an implicit background, a concept that seems to be confirmed by later phenomenology of perception. It seems obvious that, because of the nature of this prereflective ground, verbal or visual articulation of it cannot take place in an explicit sense. On the contrary, the phenomenological gaze at this background takes place indirectly (p. 69) as a preunderstanding of the world. If this is so, then not only our epistemological ground is constituted as an identity of interpretation of different levels of perception, but also the concept of representation as such is constituted as a movement out of a prereflective background. This is precisely the background against which it becomes possible for an <b>articulated</b> <b>structure</b> to take place and be identified as such (pp. 75-77). This also means that the difference between different levels of articulation, namely between a preunderstanding background and a given object is precisely what allows us to see the object and situate it within our world of experience. If we accept Vesely's argument, then the difference that formerly stood as an epistemological barrier now becomes a necessary condition for representation to take place.|$|E

Tracking <b>articulated</b> <b>structures</b> like a hand or body {{within a reasonable}} time is challenging because of the high-dimensionality of the state space. Recently, a new optimization method, called 'Stochastic Meta-Descent' (SMD) has been introduced in computer vision. This is a gradient descent scheme with adaptive and parameter-specific step sizes able to operate in a constrained space. However, while the local optimization works very well, reaching the global optimum is not guaranteed. We therefore propose an enhanced algorithm that wraps a particle filter around multiple SMD-based trackers, which {{play the role of}} many particles, i. e. that act as 'smart particles'. After the standard particle propagation {{on the basis of a}} simple motion model, SMD is performed and the resulting new particle set is included such that the original Bayesian distribution is not altered. The resulting 'Smart Particle Filter' (SPF) tracks high-dimensional <b>articulated</b> <b>structures</b> with far fewer samples than previous methods. Additionally, it can handle multiple hypotheses and clutter, where pure optimization approaches have problems. Good performance is demonstrated for the case of hand tracking from 3 D range data.

40|$|Before the 20 th century, timbre {{was long}} ignored for its {{potential}} to <b>articulate</b> musical <b>structure</b> in Western art music. Primary parameters like melody, tonality, and harmony are elements upon which hierarchical organisation in music is built. In tonal music of the common practice era, the use of primary parameters to <b>articulate</b> <b>structure</b> has been extensively explored. Timbre, as a secondary parameter, however, has been an unlikely candidate, and has conventionally been regarded a carrier of melodic function. Such subordinate nature of timbre in music has hindered its possibility as a primary structural determinant. Musical structures can indeed be articulated by timbre once a timbral hierarchy is established. The scholarly research of this thesis aims at examining timbre in three aspects. First, it addresses the limitation of current definitions of timbre and their related terminologies. Second, it explores the theory of timbral hierarchy with concrete musical examples. Fred Lerdahl states that timbral hierarchy can be built using grouping structure and prolongational reduction. Some compositions of the common practice era demonstrate {{the possibility of using}} timbre to <b>articulate</b> <b>structures.</b> Such possibility is further investigated by composers in spectral and post-spectral compositions in the contemporary context. Lastly, the present research also concerns itself with the single-pitch technique. This technique serves to reverse the conventional role of pitch and timbre, turns pitch into a carrier of timbre, and displays timbre as an important musical element. Aside from the Western attempts on composing with timbre, the Chinese counterpart also displays the use of timbral treatment in a traditional repertoire, qin music. The sophisticated timbral subtleties in qin music have inspired further artistic creations in the contemporary context.
