5|$|Dave Skylark is {{the host}} of the talk show Skylark Tonight, where he {{interviews}} celebrities <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their 1,000th episode, the show's producer Aaron Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. A while later Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Skylark discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of Skylark Tonight, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a place outside Dandong, China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Skylark.|$|E
5|$|Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass is a {{collection}} of essays written by British writer, doctor, and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple and published in book form by Ivan R. Dee in 2001. In 1994, the Manhattan Institute started publishing the contents of these essays in the City Journal magazine. They are <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> , the mentality of society as a whole, and the troubles of the underclass. Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into {{a collection}}, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.|$|E

25|$|Those in the Evangelical camp {{began to}} argue that the Liberals were engaged in a massive compromise, if not betrayal, of the central tenets of Christianity. Many of the nineteenth century Evangelicals had prized higher learning, {{cultural}} engagement, and pursued matters of social justice and reform (like anti-vivisection, anti-slavery, prison reform). However, as the gospel message of the Liberals was perceived to be largely about social reform and not <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> repentance from sin, the suspicions between the two camps widened.|$|E

25|$|Twitty {{said that}} she vowed to share her story shortly {{following}} her daughter's disappearance, {{in the hope that}} other families would not suffer what she had to go through. After searchers had spent five months in an unsuccessful quest to find Natalee, her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> safety. When she thought about reaching more travelers with her story, Twitty said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.|$|E
25|$|Pól {{initially}} {{left the}} group to pursue a solo career {{and work with the}} WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) organisation in Britain. He released a trio album in 1993 with Guo Yue and Joji Hirota under the new name Trísan. The true reason for Pól's departure is unknown; being a family band, very little information is released <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> and professional relations about and between the members. Pól rejoined the band in January 2011, when Clannad performed at Temple Bar TradFest. Initially a single concert, it was extended with an extra two nights.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{reception}} of 2008's Loyalty to Loyalty {{and the release}} of 2010's Behave Yourself, the band sought to work on new material that spanned the course of three months in Nashville and California after two years of touring. Produced by Jacquire King, responsible for the mainstream success of fellow American rock band Kings of Leon, the album marks as a departure from the band's dark blues rock-influenced folk tales heard in their previous records into a more mainstream sound with lyrics that talk <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> relationships.|$|E

25|$|In 1856, Congressman Rust became drew public {{attention}} {{for his efforts}} to oppose Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts, who appeared likely to become Speaker of the House. Banks opposed further extension of slave territory, unlike Rust and his constituents. According to the Rust family history, Rust introduced something labeled a compromise resolution, which New York Tribune newspaperman Horace Greeley characterized Rust’s {{as an attempt to}} make it appear that the contest over the speakership was <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> rivalries among the candidates and not about principles. Greeley believed its true purpose was to oppose Banks's candidacy. After Congress adjourned, on the day The Tribune reached Washington, Rust accosted Greeley on the Capitol grounds and felled him with his cane. A few days later, Rust again struck Greeley again on the streets of Washington.|$|E
25|$|Emily Pronin {{has argued}} that the {{subjective}} experience of free will is supported by the introspection illusion. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.|$|E
500|$|Bloc Party {{wanted to}} create an album that further distanced the band from the {{traditional}} rock set-up by incorporating more electronic elements and unconventional musical arrangements. As the record's title suggests, its tracks are <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> relationships and are loosely based on one of frontman Kele Okereke's break-ups in 2007. Three songs were released as singles: [...] "Mercury", [...] "Talons", and [...] "One Month Off"; the first two tracks entered the UK Top 40. Intimacy was generally well received by critics. Reviewers often focused on its rush-release and central theme, and considered them either bold steps or poor choices.|$|E

500|$|Sadler {{wrote about}} many topics. In 1909, he {{published}} his first book, an evangelical work, titled Self-Winning Texts, or Bible Helps for Personal Work. In the 1910s, he regularly worked all night on his writing projects. In addition to 42 books, {{most of which}} were <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> health issues, he wrote magazine articles. Many of Sadler's books focused on popular self-help topics; historian Jonathan Spiro deems Sadler's The Elements of Pep a [...] "quintessential book of the 1920s". In 1936, Sadler published Theory and Practice of Psychiatry, a 1,200-page work in which he attempted to provide a comprehensive outline of psychiatry.|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} {{focus of}} the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote {{that the experience of}} watching the film was similar to reading high quality fan fiction; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different. Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that [...] "Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> loyalty, love, and war." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{its debut}} album, Bleed the Fifth in early 2007 with production duties handled by former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader. The {{title of the}} album is a play on words, Cazares comments [...] "You {{have the right to}} keep your mouth shut, but on this record we believe we’re saying a lot". Cummings wrote the majority of the lyrics, which are <b>about</b> <b>personal</b> strifes and how people overcome them. Much of the lyrical content was influenced by the Book of Revelation, natural disasters, war, and terrorism. Cazares stated the album is a [...] "big fuck you" [...] to the people who want his projects to fail.|$|E
