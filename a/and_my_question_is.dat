40|$|This text {{refers to}} the Indian {{religious}} beliefs, Hinduism in particular, that we can meet in the Czech Republic. Many {{people are interested in}} these religions <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> 'what makes present man so interested in these religions and what is so attractive to them?' Foremost in my text there is basic information about Hinduism, including the myths, Gods and Goddesses and creeds. As the Indian culture is very diverse and rich I have only mentioned basic information for understanding the text well. Then I have described yoga in the text, Bhaktiyoga in particular. This type of yoga forms part of the Hare Khrisna movement. Both Yoga in Daily Life and the Hare Khrisna have already worked for many years and both have continuity with their Indian founders and came into our subconscious through their spiritual pursuit. I have described their influence in the Czech Republic on the basis of my questionnaire and even on my personal experience. Apart from these two movements this text refers to individual persons who are active in this kind of lifestyle. My conclusion is that these religious trends do not signify any danger or threat for our society; on the contrary it means that by helping us to find our way to God this enriches our daily lives.

I will also examine how the three schools work with students, and in what way they approach students with dyslexia/reading- and writing difficulties, {{so that they could}} reach goals set by The Swedish National Agency for Education. The aim with this essay is to show differences between schools in the same community <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> if it is the way you approach students with dyslexia/reading- and writing difficulties that affects the student’s grades and results. The study is concentrating on three schools in one community and students with dyslexia and reading- and writing difficulties that went to those schools. I have spoken to remedial teacher at each school about how they approach students with dyslexia/reading- and writing difficulties, what kind of methods the use, how they investigate if a student is in need of special help and how they grade their students who are in need of special teaching because of their learning disabilities. This essay will also present different ways of defining dyslexia and how to approach the pedagogic difficulties that will appear in situations where students with reading- and writing difficulties gets exposed and are in need of special education or help. The results of this study can only be connected to those schools that have been studied for this exam. The results can not in any way be generalising for all schools in Sweden. However did the study results show that students that went to school 2 reached higher goals than students that went to school 1 or 3. The study also shows that these schools use different ways to work with students with dyslexia and reading- and writing difficulties. But to compare numbers and grades can’t give a fair picture of how each school work with each student so that they develop those skills and knowledge that is seen as necessary to become a democratic member of the society. Because numbers and grades cant tell anything about the student’s disabilities or what kind of knowledge or skills the student is in possession of. Nevertheless can this study when comparing grades, in the most general way, say that students that go to school 2 are more likely to reach goals that are set by The Swedish National Agency for Education...|$|E
40|$|The African {{customary}} law, 1 {{relating to}} the intestate succession has always been known to discriminate against women and specifically female children. We live in a developing country where the law {{is used as a}} tool to develop and transform the lives of the people. Legislation has previously failed to prohibit the discrimination against women and female children <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether the law of our current times has succeeded to protect women and female children against the customary law of intestate succession in South Africa. The Constitution of South Africa 1996 is the supreme law of the country of South Africa and it provided the legal foundation for the Republic. In my dissertation I will be focusing on section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa 1996 which stipulates the following: ?Everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law. Being equal before the law means all laws may not unfairly discriminate against anyone. Everyone is entitled to equal rights and freedom. This also means there should be equal representation on legislative bodies (in other words, bodies that make our laws). In this way we can make sure that all the different needs {{of the people of the}} country are shown in the laws. The right to 'equal protection before the law' means people have a right to the same opportunities and to have equal access to resources, which would allow them to be equal in the future?. 2 The question is whether section 9 of the Constitution is being promoted amongst the African people in South Africa who are still practicing and living according to customary law when it comes to issues of intestate succession. 3 Amongst tribes in South Africa, succession to status in customary law is based on the principle of primogeniture 4. According to that principle the eldest son is the only person eligible to succeed the deceased. The women and female children are excluded from succeeding the deceased. This means that the women and female children were excluded purely on the basis of gender. This dissertation will give a background of how the law previously failed to protect women and female children living according to customary law in South Africa on their rights to intestate succession. It will also show the revolution of our law, in discussing the law that is currently in place to protect women and female children and whether these law and legislation are enough to protect women and female children whom are still living according to the customary law in South Africa. Was the declaration of the male primogeniture principle as unconstitutional and the implementation of the Intestate Succession Act 81 of 1987 along with the Reform of Customary law of Succession and Regulation Matters Act 11 of 2009 enough tools to transform and protect women and female children form discrimination in the intestate succession in customary law?Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|In {{the current}} socio-political climate pedagogies {{consistent}} with rationalism {{are in the}} ascendancy. One way to challenge the purchase of rationalism within educational discourse and practice is through the body, or by re-thinking the nature of mind-body relations.

However, the emergence of community-partnered project-based (CP) studio courses at many independent art colleges signals a fundamental shift in art and design higher education. Though room remains for interior-focused individual practice, a growing importance is placed on a curriculum that emphasizes community-partnered, project-based, interdisciplinary, and collaborative service-learning, and the goal of my dissertation research is to better understand this phenomenon, both the experience of teaching these courses and how they might influence faculty and the institutions more broadly. ^ <b>My</b> primary research <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> 2 ̆ 2 How do faculty understand and describe the pedagogical methodologies involved in teaching community-partnered project-based courses (CP) in art and design higher education? 2 ̆ 2 <b>And,</b> <b>my</b> secondary <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> 2 ̆ 2 How has teaching in CP courses influenced faculty 2 ̆ 7 s pedagogy in subsequent traditional studio courses? 2 ̆ 2 And, in order to situate my research, it is helpful to explore the contemporary context that has given rise to CP coursework in art school education. ^ For my dissertation, I conducted a qualitative phenomenological research project consisting of in-depth interviews with 18 faculty members teaching CP courses at three independent art colleges: Art Center College of Design, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Otis College of Art and Design.

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{deals with}} the emotional experiences of employees providing person-related services. Unlike a considerable body of research on service work which concentrates on the strains tied to emotional labour, my focus lies on positive emotions which are assumed to contribute to employeesâ health <b>and</b> well-being. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how <b>and</b> why positive emotions emerge in the workplace. Rather than treating emotion as an individual given and positive emotions as the outcome of individual traits, I show that organizational factors play a decisive role {{for the emergence of}} positive emotions. Professional elderly care is one of the prominent examples that rebut the traditional picture of the neutral organization. Here organization structures and processes are deeply infused with emotion. My findings as to the triggers of positive emotions stem from case studies carried out in three nursing homes. As a result of <b>my</b> interviews <b>and</b> observations, it turned out that caregivers experience the entire spectrum of emotions at work. That is, all elderly care nurses reported on upsetting and shattering emotional experiences at work as well as on â really beautifulâ moments and work situations. As a comparative analysis of the case studies shows, the latter type of experiences which are linked to positive emotions may be traced back to certain organizational conditions, namely working conditions and corporate philosophies. Based on rich accounts of emotional experiences at service work the aim is to deliver a differentiated picture of the role of organizational conditions for positive emotions. This is an important basis for the design of humane working conditions which are able to promote employeesâ health and well-being. To summarize, the experience of positive emotions in the field of professional elderly care is influenced by three factors: firstly, the subjective perceptions of good care, secondly, the structural work conditions within the nursing facilities and, thirdly, the dominant organizational culture which is reflected, inter alia, in the routines of dealing with each other and the leadership style of the executives within the institutions. Especially the last point seems to play a crucial part in determining whether positive emotions in the workplace occur or not...|$|R

40|$|From its revolutionary arrival on the behaviorism-dominated scene, the information-processing ap-proach to both {{understanding}} human intelligence, and to {{the attempt}} to bestow such intelligence on a machine, has always proceeded under the assump-tion that human cognition is fundamentally compu-tation (e. g., see (vE 95) in connection with CogSci, and (Hau 85) in connection with standard AI). But this approach can no longer leave it at that; {{it can no longer}} rest content with the coarse-grained creed that its allegiance is to the view that intelligence consists in processing information. There are two reasons: First, AGI is now on the scene, insisting, rightly, that general intelligence should be the fo-cus. Second, ours is an age wherein the formal sci-ence of information processing takes quite seriously a detailed mathematical framework that generates a difficult and profound question: “What kind of information processing should those interested in general intelligence take the mind to rest upon, some form of standard, Turing-level computation, or that <b>and</b> hypercomputation? ” <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not to be confused with: “Which form of Turing-level computation fits best with human cognition?” This <b>question</b> has <b>been</b> raised, and debated, for decades. 1 A recent position on this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> stated by (LEK+ 06), who argue that Turing-level neurocomputation, rather than Turing-level quan-tum computation, should be the preferred type of information processing assumed and used in cogni-tive science.

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that people with a mental illness (MI) diagnosis face social stigma. The social stigma of mental illness figures in analyses {{of the effects of}} MI on social networks, and a range of other outcomes, including recovery. I address this issue {{in the context of the}} postsecondary educational trajectories of students with MI. For students with MI, academic success is an important correlate of recovery. Yet, we lack studies that focus explicitly on the association between the stigma of MI, social networks, and academic outcomes. When students with MI interact with professors, fellow students, and staff, such as disability services staff, the social networks formed by those interactions may reflect the stigmatized nature of their condition. My research looks at: (1) the effects of MI on academic and social networks and support; and (2) the effects of these students’ social and academic networks and support on educational persistence <b>and</b> attainment. <b>My</b> research <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether the negative effects of stigmatized MI on their educational outcomes are mediated by social and academic networks.

Through my research I have found that music can benefit most students, not all because everyone has different needs - but many, in their learning process. Music, for example, helps with a new means of expression for students.

I emanated from the theory advocated by researchers Ohlsson, Homer-Dixon and Gleick, arguing that the detailed incorporation of water management in negotiations as well as in a final peace treaty between countries is crucial for these to be sustainable. I used this theory in analysing the extended data related to the two countries’ water resources and water policies, as well as two previous rounds of negotiation. I {{came to the conclusion that}} for any future negotiation to lead to a sustainable peace agreement between the two countries, it is crucial for them to establish very detailed stipulations on the shared water resources. Both Israel and Syria are in great need of accessing and controlling water resources, however Israel is much more dependent than Syria on the waters of the Golan Heights. When an internationally recognized borderline between the countries in the future will be established, it will by default be situated on or closely connected to vital water resources. Therefore the water management, including use of and withdrawal from these resources needs to be clearly regulated, otherwise conflict might rise again between the two countries. If water management would be included in the peace treaty in as thoroughly manner as the theorists suggests, this would enable the treaty to become sustainable, as well as make feasible the resolution of related conflicting matters...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This practice-led Ph. D. is comprised of {{a body of work}} (hybrid films) and its contextual analysis. Together they constitute a method that aims to understand and re-interpret the dialogical relationship between live action and animation filmmaking. The research argues that from its beginning the art of moving images has presented a struggle between opposed tendencies such as imprint and construction, machine eye and artist s hand, dissection of time and condensation of time that are found between the unstable duality of live action and animation. While mainstream cinema has focused most of its efforts on taming the collisions that occur within the integration of live action and animation, it has also relied on the interface s instability to animate its being. As the interface becomes more invisible in the digital age, this research reconsiders the interaction between live action and animation in moving-image production and the construction of meaning in filmmaking as it incorporates the digital into its languages. In contextualising the double and fluctuating nature of co-presence in live action <b>and</b> animation, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> How could the integration of the opposing attributes of live action and animation interrupt perceptual realism and produce a sense of estrangement in a meaningful way? Firstly this involves identifying the constantly mobile tension between live action and animation. Secondly integration is informed by ideas of estrangement and derealisation, and methods of interrupting perceptual coherence within the screened world to reveal insights into the world of social relations. Two underlying themes are addressed: (1) the uncanniness of co-presence, and (2) the expression of subjectivity through this co-presence. Interrogating the constructedness of the hybridised figure as it appears on screen by exposing its inherent conflicts, and exploring the aesthetics of estrangement and the expression of subjectivity in hybrid films led to an inquiry about cinematic time and movement. This revealed another dimension to the difference and interrelationship between live action and animation. Being both the source and outcome of these themes as expressed in the written thesis, the practical component of this project consists of three hybrid films: Nothing to Do with Weather (3 50), Animating Animator the Animated (2 47), and Flying Tunes (8 27). Theoretical findings are identified through the analysis of works by other artists and discussion of their concepts, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> own practice contributes to knowledge by inspiring, assessing <b>and</b> demonstrating <b>my</b> ideas on hybridity. My three practices are, to some extent, an allegory about the alienation a Far-East Asian filmmaker may feel in a world seemingly dominated by Western paradigms. The films chart my Far-Eastern Asian independent filmmaker s research as a journey towards an adaptation of the aesthetics and methods of contemporary filmmaking originating in Western culture and philosophy. As a piece of research, the transformation of the researcher through practice may be considered of significance in the formation of theory...|$|R

In theory, exposure to more women in parliament will alter people's perceptions of politics as a male domain, which will create more acceptances to women as political leaders. This is part of what is called symbolic representation, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> second research <b>question</b> <b>is</b> the following: How does the parity law affect the symbolic representation of women in Senegal? My focus is on both political elites within the National Assembly and the public. For the former, data is collected through interviews during fieldwork in Dakar, Senegal. For the latter, I use survey data. My findings show that the parity law was a result of strategic mobilisation from a united women’s movement, which profited from the political will of former president Abdoulaye Wade and a favourable international climate. It is possible that Wade saw opportunities in supporting parity, both with regards to electoral support from the female electorate, and goodwill from the international community by appearing modern and democratic. Furthermore, the framing of gender quotas as “parity” might have facilitated adoption since “quotas” remain controversial and, to some, discriminatory. As for symbolic representation within the National Assembly, there may have been a moderate change in attitudes. However, this depends on how symbolic representation is operationalized. This thesis provides a set of indicators that can serve as a framework for further research on the subject of symbolic representation. Among the public, changes are more visible. Quotas seem to polarize public opinions among gender lines. This indicates that people react differently to parity. </p...|$|R

This dissertation {{is based on}} ethnographic research conducted {{in the village of}} Balástya, Hungary between 2001 - 2003. It is concerned with the nature of post-socialist life as lived, interpreted, and negotiated by rural people after the collapse of state-socialism. It discusses post-socialist life and economy and how rural people express their conceptions of the past, present <b>and</b> future. <b>My</b> central <b>question</b> <b>is</b> simple. What happens to people's identity and how people invent new ways of generating livelihoods when the political, economic and social system of forty-five years of socialism [...] a frame of reference that people used and lived through [...] vanishes and an extralocal economic model is crudely mapped on the lived landscape of everyday reality? As this ethnography demonstrates, post-socialist life is filled with anxiety. I claim that the anxiety is driven and fueled by the transformation from socialism to capitalism, and by the visible gap between observed phenomena of the "lived post-socialism" and the political-economic discourses of "capitalism. " This study examines this critical and anxious transformation through the prism of a local economic innovation that I coin the "hoop-house economy. " It investigates its emergence, endurance and persistence over time and argues that the shifting meanings of the hoop-house economy accurately mirror this transformation from market-socialism to market-capitalism, {{all the way up to}} the creation of the EU's market. Conceptually, the model of the hoop-house economy demonstrates the dialectical relationship between economy's two spheres [...] house and market. I distinguish among three types of the hoop-house economy, which I call 1) minimal, 2) liminal and 3) maximal and argue that the liminal hoop-house economy best represents the tension between economy's two value domains [...] commensurate and incommensurate [...] in post-socialist Hungary. This work challenges generalizations and broad assumptions about the transformation from socialism to capitalism. By examining this transformation through the complexities of local practices <b>and</b> ordinary life, <b>my</b> dissertation extends, but also complicates macro-level analyses, illuminating the linkages between changing political and economic institutions and the micro-level of everyday reality...|$|R

D. 900). I consider plazas not as by-products of temples and palaces, but as political arenas in which different social actors created and transformed social realities <b>and</b> values. <b>My</b> primary <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how power relations and ideologies emerge from people's practices and their engagements with materiality [...] more specifically, {{the construction of}} plazas and ritual performances. I address this question through the combination of various methods including the following: spatial analyses based on GIS, extensive excavations, epigraphic studies, and material analyses through petrographic microscopy and particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Using these methods, I conducted archaeological research at El Palmar, a Maya polity located in southeastern Campeche of Mexico. During the 2007 - 2014 field seasons, I investigated eleven plazas in total with eight located in the urban core and three in its outlying areas. The results from the urban core suggest that the power relations at El Palmar changed through time. Such changes {{are reflected in the}} designs of both public and exclusive plazas and associated ritual events. The results in the north outlying plaza, where a hieroglyphic stairway was built around A. D. 726, further suggest that a group of officials negotiated their status and power with rulers. The protagonist of the event was not an El Palmar ruler but an official who emphasized diplomatic relations with foreign rulers, giving the El Palmar ruler only scant reference. Considering inter-regional contexts, however, they were not only engaged in internal power struggles, but also cooperated to negotiate with foreign dynasties. This complex mechanism of power was closely tied to the remodeling of the plaza and ideological symbolism materialized by mortuary practice, fire rituals, <b>and</b> termination rituals. <b>My</b> dissertation concludes that ritual performances in outlying plazas were not merely a reflection of royal ideology promoted by rulers but could have introduced new power and ideological relations in the community, relations that would be difficult to identify solely through the analysis of the main plaza...|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} interest {{centers on}} payments for ecosystem services (PES), a prominent strategy to address economic externalities of resource extraction and commodity processing, improving both social and ecological outcomes. Given {{the novelty of}} these kinds of institutions, my research uses them as a set of compelling cases for studying institutional creation, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> driving research <b>question</b> <b>is</b> “How are institutions in support of PES created?” Importantly, my research spans environmental economics and business studies to study how PES schemes might more fully incorporate the private sector, an outcome that will be essential to their success. In the face of widespread enthusiasm, PES still has faced considerable legitimate critique. My research agenda is focused on a critical analysis of the development of PES from the perspective of organizational institutionalism. I principally use the literature on institutional work, which serves as a lens for understanding the reorganisation of existing practices and norms (Lawrence & Suddaby, 2006). The research seeks to offer a unique contribution by interpreting PES through a neo-institutional perspective. Through both qualitative and quantitative approaches, the work identifies a key flaw in many current studies of PES: a thin conception of institutions as rules that ignores more subtle ways in which institutions and power are involved in the creation of PES systems. This dissertation is comprised of four papers each contributing to the debate on PES by drawing insights from the institutional theory literature. Comprised of a meta-analysis literature review, two case studies and a contextual theory-driven paper, the findings are applicable for both PES scholars and practitioners. By engaging in this new perspective, PES scholars and practitioners will better understand how less frequently or easily observed institutions and forms of power can affect the development and effectiveness of PES initiatives. Collectively, the findings indicate that in order for PES to become a successful tool for sustainability, it must break from singularly using rational action and transaction cost theory as governing theories. The research offers recommendations to conceptually reframe PES as a tool for enabling sustainable relationships with nature, conserving and restoring ecosystems and their benefits for people...|$|R
