25|$|Calculus is used {{in every}} branch of the {{physical}} sciences, <b>actuarial</b> <b>science,</b> computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically modeled and an optimal solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one {{and are trying to}} find the other.|$|E
25|$|As a result, <b>actuarial</b> <b>science</b> {{developed}} along {{a different}} path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, {{as opposed to}} the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption). This concept is inconsistent with financial economics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Actuarial</b> <b>science</b> {{became a}} formal {{mathematical}} {{discipline in the}} late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, life insurance, and annuities. These long term coverage required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, {{as well as the}} development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This {{led to the development of}} an important actuarial concept, referred to as the present value of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics.|$|E
