25|$|One of {{the central}} tenets in Easterly’s {{approach}} is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies {{not only to the}} identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find out what the population wanted, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government.|$|E
25|$|The fell is {{invariably}} {{climbed from}} Seathwaite, taking the bridleway from Stockley Bridge which goes to Styhead Tarn for a kilometre, passing the waterfall of Taylorgill Force, before striking south westerly over rocky terrain {{to reach the}} cairned northern summit. A ridge path works its way south from here although it bypasses both Great Slack and the south top and a short detour is needed to reach them. An alternative is to make for Sprinkling Tarn from either Esk Hause or Sty Head <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> back along the ridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Cornwall {{are involved in}} the manufacture of tin ingots. They mine the ore, smelt it <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it is transported to the island of Ictis by wagon, which can be done at low tide. Merchants purchasing it there pack it on horses for 30days to the river Rhône, where it is carried down to the mouth. Diodorus says that the {{inhabitants of}} Cornwall are civilised in manner and especially hospitable to strangers because of their dealings with foreign merchants.|$|E

The AIC-CURE International Children's Hospital is a 30-bed hospital that serves approximately 8,000 children per year, also operating mobile clinics to remote regions. The orthopedic training {{program has been}} certified by the College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa, where surgeons will spend five years training at the hospital <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> at another CURE hospital for an additional amount of time. CURE clubfoot, a non-surgical treatment for the correction of clubfoot in young children, is hosted in this hospital.|$|E
25|$|Further south, {{a branch}} from Hitchin to Royston {{and on to}} Shepreth was opened in March 1850 and worked by the GNR. This line was meant to connect with a {{previously}} authorized GER line at Shepreth. The GER had not built this line but opposed GNR powers to extend from Shepreth to Cambridge themselves. An agreement was reached for the GER to build the Shepreth to Cambridge section <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> the whole line from Hitchin to Cambridge for 14 years, with the GER taking over the expensive guarantee that the GNR had given to the Hitchin & Royston company.|$|E

25|$|The Sir Charles Clore Jewish-Arab Community Centre in the Kiryat Wolfson {{neighbourhood}} runs youth {{clubs and}} programs for Jewish and Arab children. In 1990, Mohammed Faheli, an Arab resident of Acre, founded the Acre Jewish-Arab association, which originally operated {{out of two}} bomb shelters. In 1993, Dame Vivien Duffield of the Clore Foundation donated funds for a new building. Among the programs offered is Peace Child Israel, which employs theatre and the arts to teach coexistence. The participants, Jews and Arabs, spend two months studying conflict resolution <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> together to produce an original theatrical performance that addresses the issues they have explored. Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the centre runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5–11. Some 1,000 children {{take part in the}} Acre Centre's youth club and youth programming every week. Adult education programs have been developed for Arab women interested in completing their high school education and acquiring computer skills to prepare for joining the workforce. The centre also offers parenting courses, and music and dance classes.|$|E
25|$|Historical tables {{within the}} President's Budget (OMB) provide {{a wide range}} of data on federal {{government}} finances. Many of the data series begin in 1940 and include estimates of the President's Budget for 2009–2014. Additionally, Table 1.1 provides data on receipts, outlays, and surpluses or deficits for 1901–1939 and for earlier multi-year periods. This document is composed of 17 sections, each of which has one or more tables. Each section covers a common theme. Section 1, for example, provides an overview of the budget and off-budget totals; Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source; and Section 3 shows outlays by function. When a section contains several tables, the general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> down to more detailed tables. The purpose of these tables is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely to be most useful. The most common comparisons are in terms of proportions (e.g., each major receipt category as a percentage of total receipts and of the gross domestic product).|$|E

500|$|In the past, Ryan {{supported}} {{legislation that}} would have allowed some illegal immigrants to apply for temporary guest-worker status, including one bill that would have provided a pathway to permanent residence status (a Green Card) for such immigrants. However, more recently Ryan [...] "has adopted a firm anti-amnesty, enforcement-first stance" [...] on illegal immigration. He voted against the DREAM Act, {{a bill that would have}} provided conditional permanent residency to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children provided they attend college or serve in the military, and met other criteria. He also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.

500|$|War for Cybertron {{has several}} {{multiplayer}} modes to choose from. Deathmatch is a free-for-all game type where the {{player with the}} most kills {{at the end of}} the game is the winner. In Team Deathmatch players are divided into Autobot and Decepticon teams. [...] The winning team is the one who earns the most kills. Conquest is a capture-and-hold style game, similar to the conquest mode found in the [...] series. [...] Multiple control points are spread across the level. [...] The object is for players to capture enemy control points by standing near them for a set amount of time while defending their own control points. [...] In Countdown to Extinction players must take an active bomb and place it at an enemy base, similar to the Assault mode in the Halo series. Power Struggle is the game's equivalent to the common King of the Hill game type. Finally Code of Power is a mode consisting of two and a half minute rounds where teams vie for a giant melee weapon. Also available is the Escalation game mode, the only multiplayer mode where players can control characters from the campaign or downloadable content. [...] Players choose a faction <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>work</b> cooperatively to defeat continuous waves of enemy robots until all players are defeated, similar to the Horde mode found in Gears of War and the Halo series Firefight game modes. Players earn credits by defeating enemies which can be used to unlock ammunition, weaponry, health and new areas in each map.|$|E
