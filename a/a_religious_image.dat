2500|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, with Protochronism {{receiving}} official endorsement, it was {{claimed that}} red, yellow and blue {{were found on}} late 16th-century royal grants of Michael the Brave, as well as shields and banners. Contemporary descriptions and later reconstructions indicate the flag of Wallachia during Michael's reign was made of damask, originally yellow-white but later faded to white. It featured a black eagle on a green juniper branch, with a cross in its beak. During the Wallachian uprising of 1821, the colors were present, among many others, on the canvas of the revolutionaries' flag (<b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image)</b> and in its fringes; much later historiography attributed to them the following meanings: [...] "Liberty (sky-blue), Justice (field yellow), Fraternity (blood red)".|$|E

A country may {{maintain}} a unified theme for several years, then change it drastically, {{in some cases}} seemingly to follow [...] "fashion moves" [...] by other countries. For instance, during the 1970s many countries issued Christmas stamps featuring children's drawings, with the young artist identified by name and age.|$|R

2500|$|Although Eakins was agnostic, {{he painted}} The Crucifixion in 1880. Art {{historian}} Akela Reason saysEakins's selection of this subject has puzzled some art historians who, unable to reconcile {{what appears to}} be <b>an</b> anomalous <b>religious</b> <b>image</b> by <b>a</b> reputedly agnostic artist, have related it solely to Eakins's desire for realism, thus divesting the painting of its religious content. Lloyd Goodrich, for example, considered this illustration of Christ's suffering completely devoid of [...] "religious sentiment" [...] and suggested that Eakins intended it simply as a realist study of the male nude body. As a result, art historians have frequently associated 'Crucifixion' (like Swimming) with Eakins's strong interest in anatomy and the nude.|$|R
5000|$|The {{criteria}} for a canonical coronation of <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image</b> are; (a) there must be widespread devotion around the image; and (b) the image must have proven antiquity. It was the second criterion that made Msgr. De la Cruz pause. Which of the two images should be canonically crowned the antique Baliti image or the new replica to which popular devotion had now been transferred? Bishop Guerrero told the priest. “Just pray, Pepe.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The solemn {{prescription}} {{of ritual}} to crowning images {{is embedded in}} [...] "Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis" [...] published by the Holy Office on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of Canonical Coronations were handwritten on parchment.

50|$|An In memoriam (Latin for {{in memory}} of) card is {{greeting}} card that is printed as a commemoration for certain {{events such as}} the sacrament of first holy communion, marriage, and the reception of holy orders. However, these cards are most associated with a death and funeral. In addition to <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image,</b> such as that of a saint, it often also includes a prayer, and details regarding the given event.

50|$|Early Christianity grew in <b>a</b> {{society where}} <b>religious</b> <b>images,</b> {{usually in the}} form of statues, both large ones in temples and small ones such as lares and penates in the home, were a {{prominent}} feature of traditional pagan religions, such as traditional Ancient Roman religion, Ancient Greek religion and other forms of Eastern paganism. Many writings by Church fathers contain strong denunciations of these practices, which seem to have included outright idol-worship. Statues on secular buildings, however, could serve as expression of secular power in various periods of Christianity, without implications of idol-worship.|$|R

5000|$|Oriented northeast, the watchtower {{was used}} as a defense system against Moro pirates from the south. [...] It was built under Augustinian Recollect priest Father Manuel Sanchez de Nuestra Sra. del Tremendal and was {{finished}} in 1796. Made of cut coral stones, its base is shaped as a perfect isosceles triangle connected to a short hexagonal tower on the second level. The tower is known for being the [...] "only perfect isosceles triangle" [...] tower-fort structure in the Philippines. It has several levels (or floors). Its central room contains <b>a</b> niche for <b>religious</b> <b>image,</b> in particular of Saint Vincent Ferrer. Wooden beams that support masonry walls are still present inside.|$|R
5000|$|The Greek fable {{tells of}} an ass that is {{carrying}} <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image</b> {{and takes the}} homage of the crowd as being paid to him personally. When pride makes it refuse to go further, the driver beats it and declares {{that the world has}} not yet become so backward that men bow down to asses. The Latin title of the fable, Asinus portans mysteria (or its Greek equivalent, ονος αγων μυστήρια), was used proverbially of such human conceit and was recorded as such in the Adagia of Erasmus.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image</b> {{is a work}} {{of visual}} art that is {{representational}} and has a religious purpose, subject or connection. All major historical religions have made some use of religious images, although their use is strictly controlled and often controversial in many religions, especially Abrahamic ones. General terms associated with religious images include cult image, a term for images, especially in sculpture which are or have been claimed to be the object of religious worship in their own right, and icon strictly a term for Eastern Orthodox religious images, but often used more widely, in and outside the area of religion.|$|E

2500|$|Byzantine Iconoclasm ( [...] , Eikonomachía) {{refers to}} two periods {{in the history}} of the Byzantine Empire when the use of <b>{{religious}}</b> <b>images</b> or icons was opposed by religious and imperial authorities within the Eastern Church and the temporal imperial hierarchy. The [...] "First Iconoclasm", as it is sometimes called, lasted between about 726 and 787. The [...] "Second Iconoclasm" [...] was between 814 and 842. According to the traditional view, Byzantine Iconoclasm was started by <b>a</b> ban on <b>religious</b> <b>images</b> by Emperor Leo III and continued under his successors. It was accompanied by widespread destruction of images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images. The Western church remained firmly in support of the use of images throughout the period, and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the Eastern and Western traditions in what was still a unified church, as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of Byzantine political control over parts of Italy.|$|R
5000|$|The New Testament does {{contain the}} rudiments of an {{argument}} which provides <b>a</b> basis for <b>religious</b> <b>images</b> or icons. Jesus was visible, and orthodox Christian doctrine maintains that Jesus is YHWH incarnate. In the Gospel of John, Jesus stated that because his disciples had seen him, they had seen God the Father (Gospel of John 14:7-9 [...] ). Paul of Tarsus referred to Jesus as the [...] "image of the invisible God" [...] (Colossians 1:15). [...] Theologians such as John of Damascus argued that the connection between Jesus' incarnation {{and the use of}} images is so strong that to reject or prohibit the use of images is tantamount to denying the Incarnation of Jesus.|$|R

Despite the confusion of mythical and historical names, the history of painting the picture painted by Dust Muhammad, is of considerable interest. His writing provides a clear allusion to the existence of <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> ban <b>images</b> of living beings, {{and at the same time}} on the relativity of this prohibition. In his treatise Dust Muhammad does not touch any problems the art of painting, nor any of its equipment. The value of this work lies in the extensive knowledge of the life and work of Persian artists of the 14th to 16th centuries.|$|R
50|$|Mahasati Meditation is a {{meditation}} technique {{concerned about how}} to end suffering. The Buddha taught {{that each of us}} could come to the very important point of the cessation of suffering. Mahasati Meditation is a simple and direct method of practice developed by Luangpor Teean Cittasubho, an important teacher in the world of Thai Buddhism. Many teachers, mostly from the East, provide many different forms of meditation. Some teachers use breath-counting and breath-concentration. Others teach concentration on a mantra or a koan. Some tell their students to visualize <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image</b> or some form of light or color. These methods all share the same central theme - the concentration of the mind.|$|E
50|$|Before eating, {{everyone}} exchanges Christmas greetings {{with each}} other. The supper {{begins with the}} breaking of the opłatek. By sharing a piece of Christmas wafer (Opłatki), when everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. The opłatek is usually blessed by the presiding Bishop, and stamped with <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image,</b> such as the nativity scene, they then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the Twelve Apostles, or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table.|$|E
50|$|The image, {{according}} to tradition, belonged to some missionaries who crossed Laguna de Bay in a launch. When the launch was shipwrecked, {{some of its}} relics were washed ashore including the icon of the Virgin. One Friday morning, some fishermen found the icon in their nets. Believing it to be <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> <b>image,</b> they decided {{to bring it to}} a parish church. When the men carried the small painting, they found it too heavy. They tried sailing with it in many directions, until they brought it near the church of Pakil. When they headed that way, the wind and current aided their course, and upon landing, they left the heavy image on a rock so they could continue their fishing duties.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} centuries AD, {{because of the}} raids made by barbarian peoples, several forts {{were built in the}} current area of Retignano, many of which are still visible, {{although}} not easily accessible.

500|$|EdwardI's {{body was}} brought south, lying in state at Waltham Abbey, before being buried in Westminster Abbey on 27October. There are few {{records of the}} funeral, which cost £473. Edward's tomb was an unusually plain {{sarcophagus}} of Purbeck marble, without the customary royal effigy, possibly {{the result of the}} shortage of royal funds after the King's death. The sarcophagus may normally have been covered over with rich cloth, and originally might have been surrounded by carved busts and <b>a</b> devotional <b>religious</b> <b>image,</b> all since lost. The Society of Antiquaries opened the tomb in 1774, finding that the body had been well preserved over the preceding 467 years, and took the opportunity to determine the King's original height. Traces of the Latin inscription Edwardus Primus Scottorum Malleus hic est, 1308. Pactum Serva ("Here is EdwardI, Hammer of the Scots, 1308. Keep the Vow"), which can still be seen painted {{on the side of the}} tomb, referring to his vow to avenge the rebellion of Robert Bruce. This resulted in Edward being given the epithet the [...] "Hammer of the Scots" [...] by historians, but is not contemporary in origin, having been added by the Abbot John Feckenham in the 16th century.|$|R
40|$|Highlighting the (often ignored) {{link between}} "Cur Deus homo" and "Proslogion", the thesis {{examines}} the ‘logic of Christianity’ Anselm of Canterbury seeks to demonstrate in an inter-religious context; his atonement theory {{is not necessarily}} a result of <b>an</b> ill-conceived <b>religious</b> <b>image</b> of God but rather can be seen to follow from a heightened ontological awareness regarding the conceivability of the God-world relationship; his philosophical theology informs his soteriology. Yet, his attempt to think God’s justice and love together remains aporetic. The thesis further explores the (allegedly) ‘a priori’ character of the ‘ontological argument’ and proposes – pointing out the a posteriori dimensions in the conceptual genesis of Anselm’s theology – a cosmological reconstruction of the unum argumentum, thus arguing for a different answer to the problem Anselm tries to solve in CDH by postulating the necessary death of Christ on the cross. Our critique of Anselm’s God-concept (philosophical and biblical ‘unfittingness’) provides the philosophical groundwork for an alternative, ecumenical, Christian logic of the unconditional: from unconditional being to unconditional love, so that the all-creator is also the all-embracing, all-sustaining, all-redeeming father-God; and unconditional love demands: a review of the religion-morality-relationship (‘Christian Overman’), unconditional ecumenism, and a lived ethos of universal humanity.
