25|$|This is an <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> {{that takes}} {{a little more than}} four and half hours to perform. Conventional abdominoplasty {{tightens}} muscles in a vertical line. In this new method, known as high lateral tension abdominoplasty, in addition to vertical-line tightening, muscles are tightened horizontally. The final result with this technique is a dramatically flat abdomen with significantly better-defined waistline.|$|E
25|$|Simul-rappelling or {{simultaneously}} rappelling — <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> {{where two}} climbers {{at the same}} time descend the same rope, or two ropes tied together, and one climber’s weight counterbalances the other. Generally the technique is considered less safe than the regular repelling; however, it’s useful in case of emergencies, or for rapping off opposite sides of a fin or spire where there are no anchor points, which is common in places like the Needles of South Dakota’s Black Hills.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Monier, a French {{gardener}} {{and known}} {{to be one of}} the principal inventors of reinforced concrete, was granted a patent for reinforced flowerpots by means of mixing a wire mesh to a mortar shell. In 1877, Monier was granted another patent for a more <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> of reinforcing concrete columns and girders with iron rods placed in a grid pattern. Though Monier undoubtedly knew reinforcing concrete would improve its inner cohesion, it is less known if he even knew how much reinforcing actually improved concrete's tensile strength.|$|E

25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> {{indicated}} for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E
25|$|Using the <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> of {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for TEMs appropriately equipped, electrons can be rejected {{based upon their}} voltage (which, due to constant charge is their energy), using magnetic sector based devices known as EELS spectrometers. These devices allow for the selection of particular energy values, which {{can be associated with}} the way the electron has interacted with the sample. For example, different elements in a sample result in different electron energies in the beam after the sample. This normally results in chromatic aberration – however this effect can, for example, be used to generate an image which provides information on elemental composition, based upon the atomic transition during electron-electron interaction.|$|E
25|$|Wooden full {{dentures}} {{were invented}} in Japan around the early 16th century. Softened bees wax was {{inserted into the}} patient's mouth to create an impression, which was then filled with harder bees wax. Wooden dentures were then meticulously carved based on that model. The earliest of these dentures were entirely wooden, but later versions used natural human teeth or sculpted pagodite, ivory, or animal horn for the teeth. These dentures were built with a broad base, exploiting the principles of adhesion to stay in place. This was an <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> for the era; {{it would not be}} replicated in the West until the late 18th century. Wooden dentures continued to be used in Japan until the Opening of Japan to the West in the 19th century.|$|E

The {{characters}} were created with minimal amounts of texturing {{to give them}} a sharp and clean look, while the backgrounds use very large textures split into 64×64 pieces, which was the largest texture size the Nintendo 64 could render. As a result, this technique caused significant memory fragmentation issues. However, the developers managed to create a proprietary system that could [...] "reshuffle" [...] memory as players played through the game to solve the fragmentation. According to lead programmer Chris Sutherland, [...] "I'd doubt many N64 games of the time did anything like that". The fact that the player could be transformed into small creatures was implemented to give some of the worlds a different sense of scale.|$|E

2500|$|Plato's Republic {{notes that}} Greek musicians {{sometimes}} played {{more than one}} note at a time, although this was apparently considered an <b>advanced</b> <b>technique.</b> The Orestes fragment of Euripides seems to clearly call {{for more than one}} note to be sounded at once. Research in the field of music from the ancient Mediterranean—decipherings of cuneiform music script—argue for the sounding of different pitches simultaneously and for the theoretical recognition of a [...] "scale" [...] many centuries before the Greeks learned to write, which they would have done before they developed their system for notating music and recorded the written evidence for simultaneous tones. All we can say from the available evidence is that, while Greek musicians clearly employed the technique of sounding more than one note at the same time, the most basic, common texture of Greek music was monophonic.|$|E
2500|$|The Pazyryk carpet was {{excavated}} in 1949 {{from the}} grave of a Scythian nobleman in the Pazyryk Valley of the Altai Mountains in Siberia. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC. This carpet is [...] and has 36 symmetrical knots per cm² (232 per inch²). The <b>advanced</b> <b>technique</b> used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates {{a long history of}} evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world. Its central field is a deep red color and it has two animal frieze borders proceeding in opposite directions accompanied by guard stripes. The inner main border depicts a procession of deer, the outer men on horses, and men leading horses. The horse saddlecloths are woven in different designs. The inner field contains 4 x 6 identical square frames arranged in rows on a red ground, each filled by identical, star shaped ornaments made up by centrally overlapping x- and cross-shaped patterns. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.|$|E
