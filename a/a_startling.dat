5|$|In the United States, {{diamonds}} {{have been}} found in Arkansas, Colorado and Montana. In 2004, <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> discovery of a microscopic diamond in the United States led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, {{is illustrated in}} a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> sight.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} of the minuet (in F-sharp major) and the trio (in F-sharp minor) continues the overall tension between major and minor. The minuet features <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> harmonic shift: its second half is suddenly interrupted by a fortissimo D-major chord, far remote from the home key, before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C-sharp major. The trio {{is linked to the}} minuet by the rhythmic similarities of their opening motifs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase {{which leads to the}} room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent {{back to the beginning of}} the current loop.|$|E

25|$|Located on a seismic {{prospect}} {{which had}} been recognized some years earlier, Mobil had waited to drill the Venture probe because the structure was deep and could contain high-pressure zones like those which had halted drilling at Sable Island in the previous decade. The Venture discovery well cost $40 million, then <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> price for a single well.|$|E
25|$|Excited utterances: Statements {{relating}} to startling events or condition made while the declarant {{was under the}} stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario listed above. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> event, and the victim is still under {{the stress of the}} event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance {{does not have to be}} made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.|$|E

25|$|The Hunter is an agile foe {{that can}} jump and pounce on a survivor, and then tear at his victim {{until he is}} knocked off, kills his prey or is killed. A hunter emits animal like screeches or light roars when close by, and a snarling growl can be heard when in close proximity.

Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of canons that he sang with his friends.|$|E

Over 8 million viewers followed the event, broadcast live on Dutch and Belgian television. Hazes was cremated the day after.|$|E
25|$|Mendis, {{although}} {{classified as}} slow-medium, bowls {{a mixture of}} deliveries, including googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks, {{as well as the}} carrom ball, released with a flick of his middle finger. For Sri Lanka Army in 2007–08 he averaged a mere 10.56 and took 46 wickets in six games, his strike rate <b>a</b> <b>startling</b> 31.
