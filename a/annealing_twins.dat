40|$|We {{report on}} the {{characterization}} of grain boundary (GB) segregation in an Fe- 28 Mn- 0. 3 C (wt. %) twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel. After recrystallization of this steel for 24 h at 700 °C, ∼ 50 % general grain boundaries (GBs) and ∼ 35 % Σ 3 <b>annealing</b> <b>twin</b> boundaries were observed (others were high-order Σ and low-angle GBs). The segregation of B, C and P and traces of Si and Cu were detected at the general GB by atom probe tomography (APT) and quantified using ladder diagrams. In {{the case of the}} Σ 3 coherent <b>annealing</b> <b>twin,</b> it was necessary to first locate the position of the boundary by density analysis of the atom probe data, then small amounts of B, Si and P segregation and, surprisingly, depletion of C were detected.

The depletion of C at the <b>annealing</b> <b>twin</b> is explained by a local change in the stacking sequence at the boundary, creating a local hexagonal close-packed structure with low C solubility.

The mechanism {{of the formation of}} these twins have been subject of numerous studies over fifty years.

This brief review will describe recent studies at Naval Research Laboratory to understand several aspects of the <b>annealing</b> <b>twins</b> including nature of these twins, the mechanism of their formation, and the compositional parameters which affect their densities. These studies have established a relation between twin density and grain size, temperature and material properties. A model of the mechanism of their formation based on the emergence of Shockley partial loops on consecutive { 111 } planes during grain migration has also been developed.

40|$|International audienceGrain growth {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} Inconel™ 718 to investigate the possible correlation of the <b>annealing</b> <b>twin</b> density with grain size and with annealing temperature. Those {{experiments were}} conducted at different temperatures in the δ supersolvus domain and under such conditions that only capillarity forces {{were involved in the}} grain boundary migration process. In the investigated range, there is a strong inverse correlation of the twin density with the average grain size. On the other hand, the twin density at a given average grain size is not sensitive to annealing temperature. Consistent with previous results for pure nickel, the twin density evolution in Inconel™ 718 is likely to be mainly controlled by the propagation of the pre-existing twins of the growing grains; i. e., the largest ones of the initial microstructure. Almost no new twin boundaries are created during the grain growth process itself. Therefore, the twin density at a given average grain size is mainly dependent on the twin density in the largest grains of the initial microstructure and independent of the temperature at which grains grow.

40|$|International {{audience}} 316 Nb {{austenitic stainless}} steels are used in nuclear industry for their excellent corrosion resistance and high temperature mechanical properties. In thick-walled components, work hardening, dynamic recovery and recrystallization govern hot workability. Static recovery and static or post-dynamic recrystallization can induce further metallurgical evolution during cooling. In addition, solute atoms and niobium-rich precipitates may significantly affect recrystallization mechanisms. Obtaining a homogeneous microstructure requires deep understanding of the hot deformation behaviour and mechanisms of this material. The influence of hot deformation conditions on recrystallization was determined from torsion tests. Metallographic and electron backscatter diffraction examinations showed extended dynamic recovery, which delays dynamic recrystallization. A particular dynamic recrystallization mechanism explains progressive elimination of <b>annealing</b> <b>twin</b> boundaries.
