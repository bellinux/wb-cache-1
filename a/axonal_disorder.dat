40|$|A high {{incidence}} of asymptomatic neuromuscular disease was found. More than half showed EMG evidence of a `myopathy' and of denervation. The commonest syndrome was a neuromyopathy with myopathic units and spontaneous muscle activity, especially fasciculations and nerve fibre loss but with normal or near normal nerve conduction. This {{is thought to be}} the result of a neuronal or <b>axonal</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|E
40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndromes are a {{group of}} {{clinically}} heterogeneous disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations of mitofusin 2 (MFN 2) have been recognized {{to be associated with}} CMT type 2 A (CMT 2 A). CMT 2 A is primarily an <b>axonal</b> <b>disorder</b> resulting in motor and sensory neuropathy. We report a male child with psychomotor delay, dysmorphic features and weakness of lower limbs associated with electrophysiological features of severe, sensory-motor, axonal neuropathy. The patient was diagnosed with early onset CMT 2 A and severe psychomotor retardation associated to c. 310 C>T mutation (p. R 104 W) in MFN 2 gene. CMT 2 A should be considered in patients with both axonal sensory-motor neuropathy and developmental delay...|$|E
40|$|Brachial plexus {{neuritis}} {{is considered}} to be an <b>axonal</b> <b>disorder</b> of an unknown etiology. This particular disease entity has been seen in relation to viral infection, immunization, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, heroin abuse, and vigorous exercise. We report two cases of pediatric patients who presented with fever, one associated with bilateral limp arms and the other had left limp arm. The 67 Ga-citrate scintigraphy outlined segments of increased uptake along the course of the bilateral brachial plexuses- a presumptive imaging evidence of brachial plexus neuropathy. Aside from our 2 cases (the first one of this, we had submitted and was featured in the interesting image section of Clinical Nuclear Medicine, Feb/ 2003), up to this present writing, there are no previous report in the literature of other documented cases of brachial plexus neuritis demonstrated by 67 Ga-citrate scintigraphy...|$|E
40|$|We {{conclude}} that endogenous Nmnat 2 prevents spontaneous degeneration of healthy axons and propose that, when present, the more long-lived, functionally related WldS protein substitutes for Nmnat 2 loss after axon injury. Endogenous Nmnat 2 represents an exciting new therapeutic target for <b>axonal</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAxonal {{transport}} {{is critical}} for supplying newly synthesized proteins, organelles, mRNAs, and other cargoes from neuronal cell bodies into axons. Its impairment in many neurodegenerative conditions appears likely to contribute to pathogenesis. Axonal transport also declines during normal aging, but {{little is known about}} the timing of these changes, or about the effect of aging on specific cargoes in individual axons. This is important for understanding mechanisms of age-related axon loss and age-related <b>axonal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Here we use fluorescence live imaging of peripheral nerve and central nervous system tissue explants to investigate vesicular and mitochondrial axonal transport. Interestingly, we identify 2 distinct periods of change, 1 period during young adulthood and the other in old age, separated by a relatively stable plateau during most of adult life. We also find that after tibial nerve regeneration, even in old animals, neurons are able to support higher transport rates of each cargo for a prolonged period. Thus, the age-related decline in axonal transport is not an inevitable consequence of either aging neurons or an aging systemic milieu...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} triggers for axon degeneration remain unknown. We identify endogenous Nmnat 2 as a labile axon survival factor whose constant replenishment by anterograde axonal transport is a {{limiting factor}} for axon survival. Specific depletion of Nmnat 2 {{is sufficient to}} induce Wallerian-like degeneration of uninjured axons which endogenous Nmnat 1 and Nmnat 3 cannot prevent. Nmnat 2 {{is by far the}} most labile Nmnat isoform and is depleted in distal stumps of injured neurites before Wallerian degeneration begins. Nmnat 2 turnover is equally rapid in injured Wld S neurites, despite delayed neurite degeneration, showing it is not a consequence of degeneration and also that Wld S does not stabilize Nmnat 2. Depletion of Nmnat 2 below a threshold level is necessary for axon degeneration since exogenous Nmnat 2 can protect injured neurites when expressed at high enough levels to overcome its short half-life. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition slows both Nmnat 2 turnover and neurite degeneration. We conclude that endogenous Nmnat 2 prevents spontaneous degeneration of healthy axons and propose that, when present, the more long-lived, functionally related Wld S protein substitutes for Nmnat 2 loss after axon injury. Endogenous Nmnat 2 represents an exciting new therapeutic target for <b>axonal</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|We report severe {{congenital}} encephalopathy {{and profound}} hypotonia associated with necrotizing myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and cataracts in 3 infants, including 2 sisters. Brain scans suggested agenesis of the corpus callosum. Neuropathological findings consisted of severe atrophy of the corpus callosum (not the usual agenesis with longitudinal callosal bundles), atrophy {{of the white}} matter, and absence of pyramidal tracts in the medulla. Multiple axonal swellings {{were present in the}} white matter and in Purkinje cells. Except for the corpus subthalamicum, gray matter structures were preserved. These findings are considered to be the expression of a primary disorder of axonal development leading to a reduction in interneuronal synaptic contacts. It is suggested that the anomaly may be due to an extension of the normal phenomenon of axonal elimination, related to a primary defect of the axonal cytoskeleton. The concept of a primary <b>axonal</b> <b>disorder</b> may also apply to other, mostly familial, conditions with progressive atrophy of the cerebral white matter and corpus callosum...|$|E
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} autoantibodies are {{molecules that}} are part of the normal immunoglobulin repertoire. This review focuses on three distinct groups of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb). These are human natural autoantibodies that, when injected into an animal model of human disease, stimulate remyelination in CNS demyelinating diseases, protect neurons and extend neuronal processes in CNS <b>axonal</b> <b>disorders,</b> and activate immune dendritic cells to produce cytotoxic T cells to clear metastatic tumors. Natural autoantibodies react to self antigens and are of relatively low affinity. They are derived from germline immunoglobulin genes and are usually polyreactive. Our experiments demonstrated CNS entry by autoradiography of labeled mAb and by MRI. Remyelinating mAb rHIgM 22 clusters beta-integrin and mouse mAb O 4 recognizes sulfatide. Neuronal outgrowth mAbs sHIgM 42 and sHIgM 12 appear to target carbohydrates on the surface of neurons. The mAb sHIgM 12 (B 7 -DC-Xab) also is promising as therapeutic against metastatic tumors. It functions by binding and cross-linking the antigen B 7 -DC on dendritic cells, inducing tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. All these mAbs activate a transient increase in intracellular calcium, signal via NFκb, and prevent apoptosis. The mAbs engage downstream signaling events that induce the primary function of the cell (that is, remyelination for oligodendrocytes, axonal preservation and neurite extension for neurons, or antigen presentation for dendritic cells). Natural human auto mAbs are a potentially important therapeutic technique in combating a wide spectrum of disease processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{significant}} progress in neuroimaging and genetic techniques has allowed for advances in the correct definition/classification of congenital brain abnormalities, which {{have resulted in a}} better understanding of their pathogenesis. In addition, new groups of diseases, such as <b>axonal</b> guidance <b>disorders</b> or tubulinopathies, are increasingly reported. Well-defined neuroimaging diagnostic criteria have been suggested for the majority of congenital brain abnormalities. Accurate diagnoses of these complex abnormalities, including distinction between malformations and disruptions, are of paramount significance for management, prognosis, and family counseling. In the next decade, these advances will hopefully be translated into deeper understanding of these disorders and more specific treatments...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} several cases {{reported}} in the literature, the exact pathogenetic mechanism of neuropathic changes in porphyric neuropathy remains uncertain. Various authors have ascribed the neuropathologic findings to either a dying-back axonal degeneration or segmental demyelination. In recent years, the hypothesis of an <b>axonal</b> and myelinic <b>disorder</b> has received support by the demonstration of a combined and simultaneous involvement of both these structures. Such different opinions are also {{a consequence of the}} reduced number of detailed bioptic observations in the different forms of acute porphyria not only during acute phases but also between attacks. In this paper we report the results of light- and electron-microscopic examination of two sural nerve biopsies from subjects with hereditary coproporphyria. The first was performed 6 months after an acute attack, the second specimen was obtained from a patient without acute attacks, who had clinical and electrophysiologic signs of a chronic progressive neuropathy. In both cases a dying-back axonal degeneration is considered the primary change. The pathogenetic mechanism of peripheral nerve lesions in porphyric neuropathy will be discussed finally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on normal nerves is well known, i. e., {{an increase in}} conduction velocity {{and a decrease in}} amplitude with an elevation in temperature. There are few reports examining the effect of temperature on abnormal nerves, e. g., in demyelination. To study the effect of increased temperature on demyelinating nerves in entrapment syndromes, the authors inves-tigated 55 median and 48 ulnar nerves of 48 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, and 48 median and 48 ulnar nerves of 26 healthy subjects. All measurements were obtained at 32 °C and 37 °C. Mean reductions in median sensory amplitude occurring with heating were significantly greater in the patient group than in the control group (P 0. 000). For median sensory response amplitude, the mean de-crease was 32. 1 % in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 10. 7 % in the control subjects. The difference between median and ulnar nerves in the latency was significantly decreased (P 0. 027) after the nerves had heated to 37 °C. It is concluded that the elevation in temperature leads to conduction block in demyelinated sensory nerves, and that temperature provocation may be useful in the diagnosis of nerve disorders. The effect may be different in <b>axonal</b> and demyelinating <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease CMT {{refers to}} the {{inherited}} peripheral neuropathies affect approximately one in 2500 people {{they are among the}} most common inherited neurological disorders. The majority of CMT patients have autosomal dominant inheritance although X-linked dominant and autosomal recessive forms also exist. The majority of cases are demyelinating although up to one third appear to be primary <b>axonal</b> or neuronal <b>disorders.</b> A patient of 9 -year-old girl visited our hospital because of began to suffer from an insidious onset of progressive distal weakness and numbness and muscle twitching in both in her upper and lower limbs. Nerve conduction studies showed sensory nerve conduction SNCV of bilateral median and ulnar nerve was reduced in upper limb and bilateral sural nerve was reduced in lower limb While in case of motor nerve conduction MNCV bilateral median and ulnar nerve was reduced in upper limb and common peroneal nerve CPN as well as posterior tibial nerve was decreased leg. F response latencies were markedly prolonged in patient. Family history along with electrophysiological studied showed It was typical case of autosomal dominant CMT 2 axonal neuropathy. CMT is currently an untreatable disorder and at the moment the treatment of CMT is only supportive as there are no drugs available that would halt the disease symptoms. The care of a CMT patient is challenging for the health care team...|$|R
40|$|Defining {{generator}} complexes {{that can}} explain the EEG data recorded at the surface, multiple dipole models can single out neuronal signal sources reliably. Through the processing of data collected at all electrode locations, they provide a unified representation of the timing and location of single network activity inside the brain. Moreover, recent literature puts forward that this family of methods is well suited to model propagating sources like those often found in cognitive tasks. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI), that often follows brain impact, mainly concerns the white matter, and {{is characterized by a}} large number of <b>axonal</b> microdamage. Neuropsychological <b>disorders</b> are a serious issue in DAI, and extremely often manifest in attentional deficits. The event-related EEG components (ERPs) most commonly assessed in the study of cognitive processes are N 2 and P 3. Generally, N 2 is elicited when attention is directed to detect infrequent stimuli in a series of frequent stimuli, and is thought {{to be associated with the}} conscious detection of deviance [1]. On the other hand, the P 3 component is elicited when the stimulus is identified and classified into a task-relevant category [2]. Presence of altered cortical conductivity and abnormal ERPs was demonstrated in a variety of previous works on TBI patients, and for a great range of cognitive tasks. The goal of this study was to investigate the cognitive processing reorganization in post-traumatic DAI patients by means of ERPs for a simple and repeatable test, not involving cognitive function other than attention and response inhibition [3]. In this study, moving dipoles were applied in order to assess the modification in location and/or number of the electrical generators for N 2 and P 3 in DAI patients with respect to physiology. Any difference could help in disclosing compensating mechanisms following axonal damage...|$|R
