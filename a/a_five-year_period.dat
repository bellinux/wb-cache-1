5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers over <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period</b> found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly {{appeared to be}} at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg {{were more likely to}} involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period.</b> Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E

The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E
5|$|The council's {{budget for}} the {{financial}} year 2015/16 is £437.2m (down from £444.8m in 2014/15). The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by government to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Following the 2010 Spending Review, the council announced that 11.1% could be cut from departmental budgets to save £65m over <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period</b> and up to 181 posts could be lost.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period,</b> along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E

It was recently restored at a cost of several hundred thousand pounds over <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period.</b> Other important collections include paintings of the Bankes family stretching back over 400 years. Other artworks include works by Diego Velázquez, Anthony van Dyck, Titian and Jan Brueghel the Younger. A portrait of Nicolò Zen the younger by Titian was discovered in the collection in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The club {{found it}} {{difficult}} to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937–38 season, when they were spared on goal averages. However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division {{at the end of the}} 1947–48 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period,</b> beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952, and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960–61 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964–65 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967–68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's Újpest in the final.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control over <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> <b>period</b> and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages {{in the area and}} reduced the transitional period to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E
