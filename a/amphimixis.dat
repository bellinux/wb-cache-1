40|$|A {{classification}} of hypotheses on {{the advantage of}} <b>amphimixis</b> over apomixis is presented. According to "Immediate Benefit " hypotheses, <b>amphimixis</b> is advanta-geous regardless of reciprocal gene exchange, because either it directly increases fitness of the progeny, reduces the deleterious mutation rate, or makes selection more efficient. In contrast, "Variation and Selection " hypotheses attribute the ad-vantage of <b>amphimixis</b> to the reciprocal gene exchange that alters genetic variability and response to selection among the progeny. Most such hypotheses assume that <b>amphimixis</b> increases variability and efficiency of selection, but some claim that <b>amphimixis</b> decreases response to selection. Variation and Selection hypotheses require that some factor, either random drift or epistatic selection, makes distributions of different alleles nonindependent, while another factor, either changes of the ge-notype fitnesses or deleterious mutations, makes overrepresented genotypes non-optimal. Numerous Variation and Selection hypotheses, dealing with either unstruc-tured or spatially structured populations, are reviewed. Two of them seem most plausible: better responsiveness of the amphimictic population to widely fluctuating selection, and lower mutation load in the amphimictic population under synergistic selection against deleterious mutations. In both cases the large advantage of am-phimixis requires rather stringent conditions, which could be falsified by careful experiment. Further progress in understanding the evolution of <b>amphimixis</b> will de-pend mostly on such experimental work...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of sexual reproduction {{is difficult to}} explain because the 2 -fold cost of meiosis requires a compensatory 2 -fold advantage {{that is difficult to}} prove. Here, I show that asexual reproduction has a short-term disadvantage due to the loss of complementation of recessive deleterious mutations, which can overcome the 2 -fold cost of meiosis in one or few generations. This complementation hypothesis can also explain why most asexual species are polyploid, why only certain types of asexual reproduction exist, why meiosis is not one-step, and the origin of <b>amphimixis.</b> I also show that the promotion of variation by recombination is not necessary to explain the evolution of <b>amphimixis.</b> Instead, recombination can be the result of an intragenomic conflict between alleles that induce the initiation of crossing over and alleles that evolve to resist that initiation. Thus recombination does not require any advantage at the individual or population level.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{maintenance}} of anisogamous sex is addressed by considering the effect of fertilization on the fitness of parthenogenetic females when such fertilization yields inviable triploid progeny. We consider four types of parthenogenesis: (i) apomixis, (ii) homogametic <b>amphimixis,</b> (iii) heterogametic <b>amphimixis,</b> and (iv) homogametic automixis. Homozygous sexual populations are genetically stable if males or selection eliminate the excess females produced by heterozygous parthenogenetic genotypes. Homozygous parthenogenetic populations are stable if the parthenogenetic output of homozygotes exceeds that of heterozygotes. In turn, sex can only invade heterozygous parthenogenetic populations when sexual output of parthenogens is larger than their parthenogenetic output. The existence of interior stable equilibria generally requires the instability {{of at least one}} boundary and some degree of heterosis. In a two-locus model, we study the evolution of mechanisms protecting either sex or parthenogenesis in reproductively polymorphic populations. We find that males do not respond to the presence of parthenogenesis {{in such a way as}} to eliminate it, but parthenogenesis is subject to selective pressures increasing reproductive isolation, and thus the success of parthenogenesis. The results suggest that reproductively polymorphic populations are ephemeral. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{population}} with u deleterious mutations per genome per generation is considered {{in which only}} those individuals that carry less than a critical number k of mutations are viable. Besides {{a large number of}} loci subject to mutation and selection, the genome contains one or two special loci responsible for the mode of reproduction. <b>Amphimixis</b> vs. selfing are considered separately. In the first case, the genome degradation rate v (=u/√k) is found to play the decisive role, {{as in the case of}} recombination. When v > 1. 25, obligate <b>amphimixis</b> is established. If v decreases below this value, the alleles with first low and then larger penetrance are fixed, until alleles conferring obligate asexual reproduction become advantageous. The proportion of resources allocated to produce seeds also increases with decrease of v. These results are unlikely to depend on the genetic basis of the mode of reproduction. The result of competition between outcrossing and selfing depends on both u and k, as well as on whether the mutations are recessive. The alleles for selfing with low penetrance are selected against if the mutations are at all recessive. The fitness of alleles with high penetrance depends primarily on u, decreasing when u increases. There may exist conditions when only the alleles providing intermediate selfing rates can be fixed in a population. In other cases a population may exist with either obligate outcrossing or selfing at a high rate. Thus, truncation selection against deleterious mutations may be a factor supporting obligate or facultative sex despite the twofold advantage of apomixis or selfing...|$|E

Furthermore, evidences suggest that apomixis does not prevent M. incognita from adapting to its environment in contrast to what is expected from mitotic parthenogenesis that should theoretically produce clonal progenies. This raises questions about mechanisms of genome plasticity leading to genetic variation and adaptive evolution in apomictic animals.

Cyst nematodes are obligate sedentary endoparasites that reproduce by <b>amphimixis.</b> Here, we report the first transcriptome analysis of two stages of H. avenae. After sequencing extracted RNA from pre parasitic infective juvenile and adult stages of the life cycle, 131 million Illumina high quality paired end reads were obtained which generated 27, 765 contigs with N 50 of 1, 028 base pairs, of which 10, 452 were annotated. Comparative analyses were undertaken to evaluate H. avenae sequences {{with those of other}} plant, animal and free living nematodes to identify differences in expressed genes.

40|$|Taxonomically {{restricted}} genes (TRGs), i. e., {{genes that}} {{are restricted to}} a limited subset of phylogenetically related organisms, may be important in adaptation. In parasitic organisms, TRG-encoded proteins are possible determinants of the specificity of host-parasite interactions. In the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita, the map- 1 gene family encodes expansin-like proteins that are secreted into plant tissues during parasitism, thought to act as effectors to promote successful root infection. MAP- 1 proteins exhibit a modular architecture, with variable number and arrangement of 58 and 13 -aa domains in their central part. Here, we address the evolutionary origins of this gene family {{using a combination of}} bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches. Map- 1 genes were solely identified in one single member of the phylum Nematoda, i. e., the genus Meloidogyne, and not detected in any other nematode, thus indicating that the map- 1 gene family is indeed a TRG family. A phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of map- 1 genes in RKNs further showed that these genes are specifically present in species that reproduce by mitotic parthenogenesis, with the exception of M. floridensis, and could not be detected in RKNs reproducing by either meiotic parthenogenesis or <b>amphimixis.</b> These results highlight the divergence between mitotic and meiotic RKN species as a critical transition in the evolutionary history of these parasites.

Two polar bodies were found within the egg, indicating that this species reproduces by <b>amphimixis.</b> The nucleus o f the oocyte of P. zeae underwent one mitotic division and the chromosome number was 2 n = 26.

The agarized medium ensures a much better physical support for forming larger colonies. The secondary gametophytes can be formed through: the branching out of the prothallic filaments (each ramification representing the intial stage for the development of a new prothallus); the elongation of the cells in the apical area of the gametophyte, (which represent the initial cells of the new prothalli); out of the cells located in the base area of the prothalli, (cells which also function as prothalian initial); out of ramifications of the prothalli.

Even though Freud dares to contemplate {{such a thing as}} a death drive, Derrida finds its contaminating taint to be already at work. Life, the latter finds, is already ‘life death’. Yet this chapter intervenes in the anxious space between Freud and his junior colleague Sandor Ferenczi: where the former speculated upon a desire to return to the inorganic, the latter suggests a ‘thalassal trend’ linking human life not simply to an uncanny desire for intrauterine existence, but to a desire to return to life in water. The thalassal trend turns not just towards our ontogenetic amniotic waters but to our phylogenetic immersion amongst earlier forms of non-human life. Current feminist work such as that of Elizabeth A Wilson and Vicki Kirby inspired by the legacies of deconstruction now refuses the doxa of a mind/body split endorsed by psychoanalysis such that we need no longer think of the body as barred to the psyche.

Evidence for population regulation in six species of thelastomatids in eight species of cockroaches {{collected from the}} field is presented. No host contained two adult males, infrapopulations with two juvenile males were very rare, the number of adult females per host was small. and monogamy was common. Juvenile males were rare while juvenile females were relatively common, indicating that, compared to females, males develop and are eliminated rapidly from hosts (leaving one), or that males are less common to start with. Infection prevalence varied markedly between the cockroach species. Reproductive competition due to crowding, and cyclical egg production were found in two species. these phenomena are discussed. Mechanisms which may control The effects of density-independent climatic factors on seasonal variation in incidence and infrapopulation structure of one thelastomatid population were transient. Evidence for population self-regulation in Protrellus dixoni was obtained from laboratory studies. Infrapopulations were regulated by a density-dependent and sex-dependent reduction in infection intensity with infrapopulation age. This reduction was not equal in initial speed or intensity between the sexes (reduction in number of males was faster) and led to infrapopulations with never {{more than a single}} adult male. and few adult females. In structure. these laboratory-produced infrapopulations resembled those in field collected hosts. Unmated females produced male progeny only (probably by arrhenotokous parthenogenesis). Female offspring probably result from <b>amphimixis.</b> Possible methods of thelastomatid infrapopulation regulation are discussed.

Regulation benefits the surviving nematodes because per capita fecundity is greater in uncrowded infrapopulations. Self-regulation may be common among thelastomatids and other parasites...|$|E
40|$|Open Access JournalDuring {{sampling}} of several Coffea arabica plantations in Tanzania severe root galling, {{caused by a}} root-knot nematode was observed. From pure cultures, morphology and morphometrics of juveniles and females matched perfectly with Meloidogyne africana, whereas morphology of the males matched identically with those of Meloidogyne decalineata. Based on their Cox 1 sequence, however, the recovered juveniles, females and males were confirmed {{to belong to the}} same species, creating a taxonomic conundrum. Adding further to this puzzle, re-examination of M. oteifae type material showed insufficient morphological evidence to maintain its status as a separate species. Consequently, M. decalineata and M. oteifae are synonymized with M. africana, which is herewith redescribed based on results of light and scanning electron microscopy, ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA sequences, isozyme electrophoresis, along with bionomic and cytogenetic features. Multi-gene phylogenetic analysis placed M. africana outside of the three major clades, together with M. coffeicola, M. ichinohei and M. camelliae. This phylogenetic position was confirmed by several morphological features, including cellular structure of the spermatheca, egg mass position, perineal pattern and head shape.

40|$|During {{sampling}} of several Coffea arabica plantations in Tanzania severe root galling, {{caused by a}} root-knot nematode was observed. From pure cultures, morphology and morphometrics of juveniles and females matched perfectly with Meloidogyne africana, whereas morphology of the males matched identically with those of Meloidogyne decalineata. Based on their Cox 1 sequence, however, the recovered juveniles, females and males were confirmed {{to belong to the}} same species, creating a taxonomic conundrum. Adding further to this puzzle, re-examination of M. oteifae type material showed insufficient morphological evidence to maintain its status as a separate species. Consequently, M. decalineata and M. oteifae are synonymized with M. africana, which is herewith redescribed based on results of light and scanning electron microscopy, ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA sequences, isozyme electrophoresis, along with bionomic and cytogenetic features. Multi-gene phylogenetic analysis placed M. africana outside of the three major clades, together with M. coffeicola, M. ichinohei and M. camelliae. This phylogenetic position was confirmed by several morphological features, including cellular structure of the spermatheca, egg mass position, perineal pattern and head shape. Moreover, M. africana was found to be a polyphagous species, demonstrating that "early-branching" Meloidogyne spp. are not as oligophagous as had previously been assumed. Cytogenetic information indicates M. africana (2 n = 21) and M. ardenensis (2 n = 51 - 54) to be a triploid mitotic parthenogenetic species, revealing at least four independent origins of mitotic parthenogenesis within the genus Meloidogyne.

40|$|The {{study of}} microturbellaria is not popular, and hence, the {{taxonomy}} and ecology {{of these animals}} are poorly known. In temperate zone ponds and lakes, {{the number of species}} may be up to 50 + per water body. The Typhloplanidae, the subject of this review, live in the littoral-benthic zone, but pelagic occurrences have been accumulating since the first case was reported in 1952. Four species are currently known to be occasionally pelagic; all live in warm-temperate or tropical lakes. Typically, one species per lake is found, but in one lake in Brazil, 2 species co-occur. One of these feeds on the other and on zooplankton, with a preference for Cladocera. Flatworms seem to trade the littoral zone for the pelagic if predation pressure in the littoral exceeds that in the open water, and if the pelagic offers better food. Most Typhloplanidae feed on arthropods, often with a preference for cladocerans, and show parallels with the cladocerans and rotifers in that 2 types of eggs (subitaneous and resting) are produced. In some flatworms, however, resting egg formation does not require <b>amphimixis.</b> There is also great variation between species in both the number of clutches and their composition, and within species, latitudinal differences may be important. At the cold extreme, species produce only one clutch of resting eggs; at the tropical extreme, species produce many subitaneous clutches, although resting eggs continue to be produced as well. The factors driving the life cycles of the pelagic species are discussed and include familiar variables such as temperature (circulation patterns), food, and predation. Flatworms also produce mucus and toxins that add complexity to their ecology; toxins are used for catching prey, and possibly for defense against predators (but not fish). If they become too abundant for their food supply, flatworms also seem to switch to resting egg production or block reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two {{different}} nematodes {{were isolated}} from the bark of Albizia lebbeck trees; one from insect infested and another from noninfested, healthy tree. Based on the biological, morphological, and molecular evidences, the nematodes are described as Dela-denus albizicus n. sp. and D. processus n. sp. (Nematoda: Hexatylina). Deladenus albizicus n. sp., isolated from insect-infested tree, multiplied on the fungus Nigrospora oryzae. Myceliophagous females of this nematode reproduced by parthenogenesis and sper-mathecae were indistinct. Infective females, readily produced in the cultures, are dorsally curved. Only one type of males containing small-sized sperms in their genital tracts were produced in the culture. Myceliophagous females: L = 0. 75 to 1. 71 mm, a = 32. 3 to 50. 8, b = 9. 3 to 11. 2, b ’ = 5. 2 to 7. 3, c = 27. 2 to 35. 6, V = 91. 0 to 93. 3, c ’ = 2. 0 to 2. 9, stylet = 11 to 12 mm, excretory pore {{in the region of}} median pharyngeal bulb, 43 to 47 mm anterior to hemizonid. Deladenus processus n. sp., isolated from bark of healthy A. lebbeck tree, was cultured on Alternaria alternata. Myceliophagous females reproduced by <b>amphimixis</b> and their spermathecae contained rounded sperms. Infective females were never produced, even in old cultures. Myceliophagous females: L = 0. 76 to 0. 99 mm, a = 34 to 49, b = 13. 3 to 17. 7, b ’ = 3. 8 to 5. 8, c = 19. 6 to 22. 8, V = 92. 2 to 93. 5, c ’ = 2. 7 to 3. 5, stylet = 6 to 7 mm, excretory pore in the proximity of hemizonid, tail conoid, tapering from both sides to a long pointed central process. It is proposed to classify Deladenus species in three groups: durus, siricidicola, and laricis groups based on female and spermatogonia dimorphism, mode of reproduction, and insect parasitism...|$|E
40|$|Parthenogenetic and amphimictic populations {{within a}} same morphospecies are {{frequently}} reported in non-marine tardigrades. A same morphospecies can have diploid bisexual population(s) reproducing by <b>amphimixis,</b> and polyploid (rarely diploid) unisexual population(s) carrying out apomixis. We assess the breeding system of two Italian populations and one Swedish {{population of the}} eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer evaluating sex-ratios, analyzing karyotypes and examining genetic structure using allozyme markers. The populations differed in sex ratio and reproductive modes. One Italian population was bisexual and amphimictic, while {{the other two were}} unisexual and parthenogenetic. Data from several years show no evidence of cyclical parthenogenesis. All populations were diploid with the chromosome number (2 n = 12) and had bivalents in the oocytes. The chromosome pairing found in the parthenogen oocytes is evidence of a meiotic maturation. The presence of chiasmata in oocytes suggests that recombination exists, even though {{we do not know how}} the diploid chromosome number is restored. With regard to the genetic structure, we analyzed 14 loci both in the amphimictic and in the parthenogenetic populations. Only three loci (GPI, IDH and PGM) were polymorphic. The amphimictic population had a degree of genetic variability (mean heterozygosity higher than 0. 25) higher than that of the parthenogenetic population. In fact, in all female populations, allele frequencies at all 3 loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg expectations due to lack of heterozygosity, in accordance with the cytological results evidencing an automictic parthenogenesis. GPI locus was represented by 6 alleles in the amphimictic populations and only by one in the automictic populations, but IDH and PGM were represented by 4 alleles both in the amphimictic and in the automictic populations, evidencing a maintained (or acquired) variability. We cannot exclude that the recent derivation of the asexual populations from few lineages (demographic bottlenecks) could explain the loss of genetic variation, in terms of number of alleles per locus, even though in populations affected by recent demographic bottleneck we expect to observe a relative heterozygosity excess due to the fact that allelic diversity decreases more rapidly than heterozygosity. We found high genetic differentiation between populations of R. coronifer. The observed value of Fst (0. 281, i. e. 28 % of the total genetic variation is due to differences between populations) is above the threshold (0. 25) usually considered indicative of high differentiation among populations. Genetic divergence is easy to explain in this species: differences in reproductive mode, fragmented habitat, patchy distribution and the ensuing difficulty in crossing from one moss fragment to another (i. e. low gene flow and high likelihood of population bottlenecks) are probably all acting on R. coronifer populations...|$|E
