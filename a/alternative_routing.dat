Major Shafat learned of the Pakistani crackdown on 26 March morning from people fleeing Dhaka and managed to warn Major Khaled, who ordered Jamil to remain vigilant until Khaled arrived in Brahmanbari to lead the revolt. An unknown person warned Majoe Jamil of the approach of the 31st Punjab detachment on 27 March early hours, and Major Jamil managed to arrest all Pakistani personnel prior to the scheduled 10:00 PM meeting. Major Khaled arrived later that day and deployed his troops to the north and east of Comilla.|$|R

40|$|The {{relocation}} of flight altitudes is a straightforward example how {{the impact of}} aviation on climate may be reduced by operational means.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{real-time}} problem of scheduling and routing trains in a railway network. In the related literature, this problem is usually solved starting from a subset of <b>routing</b> <b>alternatives</b> and computing the near-optimal solution of the simplified routing problem. We study how to select the best subset of <b>routing</b> <b>alternatives</b> for each train among all possible alternatives. The real-time train routing selection problem is formulated as an integer linear programming formulation and solved via an algorithm inspired by the ant colonies' behavior. The real-time railway traffic management problem takes as input the best subset of <b>routing</b> <b>alternatives</b> and is solved as a mixed-integer linear program. The proposed methodology is tested on two practical case studies of the French railway infrastructure: the Lille terminal station area and the Rouen line. The computational experiments are based on several practical disturbed scenarios. Our methodology allows {{the improvement of the}} state of the art in terms of the minimization of train consecutive delays.
