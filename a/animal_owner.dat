Among new students who had been at universily for three weeks, no evidence was found that companion animal separation was associated with increased levels of loneliness, irrespective of the self-reported "closeness" of the owner-companion animal relationship before separation. Because prior to leaving home companion <b>animal</b> <b>owners</b> and non-companion <b>animal</b> <b>owners</b> may have somehow differed, a comparable sample of companion <b>animal</b> <b>owners</b> and non-companion <b>animal</b> <b>owners</b> was tested immediately prior {{to the time of}} moving to university. No difference in loneliness was found due to companion animal ownership, irrespective of the self-reported degree of closeness of the relationship. As both samples may have been atypical, the impact of moving to university on loneliness was explored and a highly significant increase in loneliness was found. Overall, these findings suggest that companion animal separation does not contribute to the increase in loneliness observed when students leave home to start at university...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{failure to}} provide proper care for animals {{is an act of}} {{omission}} or neglect rather than an affirmative act, the failure to care for an animal is considered a misdemeanor offense in most states. [...] For instance, in Alaska, if an <b>animal</b> <b>owner</b> fails to provide the aforementioned standards of care, the state has prima facie evidence of a failure to care for an animal. If the prosecutor can prove the owner’s failure to care for an animal was done with criminal negligence and the failure to care for the animal caused its death or severe physical pain or prolonged suffering, then the owner may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. In Colorado, {{failure to provide}} an animal with the proper standard of care is a Class 1 misdemeanor. In Virginia, each owner must provide for each of his companion animals: adequate feed; adequate water; adequate shelter that is properly cleaned; adequate space in the primary enclosure for the particular type of animal depending upon its age, size, species, and weight; adequate exercise; adequate care, treatment, and transportation; and veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering or disease transmission. Violation of these standards is a Class 4 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation may result in a higher grade misdemeanor. Likewise, under Virginia's animal cruelty statute, any person who deprives any animal of necessary food, drink, shelter or emergency veterinary treatment is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, {{after so}} many years, Ensminger was {{able to return to}} his roots and publish in the area of his {{greatest}} interest with books and articles about dogs.Typical of Ensminger's involvement in the health field is his recent article as guest columnist for the Herald-Tribune, in which he describes the legal difficulties faced by a blind person whose service dog was attacked and killed by another dog. This sort of event, which may happen with any type of service dog, is both emotionally and financially draining : [...] "And it's not just a letter that turns a dog into a psychiatric service dog. There's a rigorous training procedure, and the whole process can cost as much as $38,000..." [...] was his response during a CNN interview. As guest columnist for the Palm Beach Post, he discusses the problem of the use of fake dog identification by owners wishing to pass their dogs as real therapy animals. Ensminger's book about service and therapy dogs is reviewed by Amy Fernandez in Dog World [...] and by Altina Wickstrom, DVM, CCRT in The Canadian Veterinary Journal, [...] "This groundbreaking book begins with a fascinating discussion of the domestication of dogs." [...] The laws regarding criminal interference with service animals vary from state to state, county to county and fines and ranges of imprisonment vary from misdemeanor to felony. Generally, the damage done to a service dog results from dog attacks and dog bites from other dogs and the service dog owner must be compensated. The main focus of his recent book on service and therapy dogs is the increasing need for service dogs of all types for both public and disabled military veterans. Jan Shubert, LCSW cites Ensminger's definition of Therapy Dog,...mostly therapy dogs in the United States today visit facilities..., in the Army Medical Department Journal [...] see full text from AMEDD in external links. The definition of service dog is of interest to public institutions so that Ensminger is cited by the NASN (National Association of School Nurses): [...] "Service animal... is a term that distinguishes those animals that serve individuals with physical or mental disabilities, usually on a one-on-one basis, from pets or other types of skilled animals, such as police dogs (Ensminger, 2010)". The definition and use of service animals is also of interest to the court system because service animals can be found nearly everywhere including within the courtroom itself. Exactly when, how and by whom a service animal may be used in the courtroom is part of our evolving legal system. Recently the Connecticut Appellate Court cited Ensminger's article in the MSU ALHC animal law online magazine, in the case: State of Connecticut v. Devon D. [...] "A facility dog can interact with people in courthouse public areas, child advocacy centers, and drug courts; play with office staff; participate in forensic interviews; calm victims and witnesses; and accompany witnesses to the stand in a courtroom." [...] John DeSantos of the New York Times subsidiary in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana interviewed Ensminger in November, 2014. The purpose of the interview was to get Ensminger's views on the use of dogs in court because such use is becoming more common nationwide and because the Parish Attorney's dog had recently been used in a case. Certainly from the prosecutors perspective the use of a dog in court may facilitate the proceedings but the defense attorney could make the argument that [...] "There could be a feeling among jurors that the dog is assuring truth, as well as allowing the child to speak, and that is not necessarily the case." [...] J. Bergal; in a 2017 article for Statelinequotes Ensminger: [...] "Nobody knows how juries will be influenced by this," [...] he said. [...] "It may be that if you get enough 'dog people' on a jury, you're going to increase your chances of conviction." [...] The access to public facilities has become a serious issue for people with service dogs which has generated legal decisions in the courts which are discussed by Ensminger and Breitkopf in the Journal of Animal Law [...] which is cited in the Yale Law School Legal Scholarship Repository. [...] Ensminger and J. Lawrence Thomas PhD (2013), article in the Journal of Forensic Psychology Practice describe some {{of the ways in which}} a service <b>animal</b> <b>owner</b> canmeet public accommodation access requirements with a letter from a doctor describing the service animal [...] which is cited by Alli Spotts-De Lazzer, MA: when legal disputes over ESA's erupt, the letter generally becomes evidence. [...] Further analysis by Ensminger indicates the problem has extended to doctors willing to sign such letters without investigation which has producedlarge numbers of falsely documented service dogs. Naturally, in response to this, courts have begun to request training records for the dog with the doctor's records containing analysis of the patient's need for a service dog and doctors are being advised that falsifying a patient's need for such an animal can adversely effect their practice and may result in criminal charges. This situation has been analyzed by Burnett and Poliakov in their Nova Law Review article of 2012, which cites Ensminger and Breitkopf: [...] "Until recently, many associations believed that challenging a request for a reasonable accommodation involving an emotional support or companion animal was a losing battle". available at [...] The PDF files for many of these articles may be found in the MSU: Journal of Animal Law, for which Ensminger is a contributing editor. As Ensminger points out Service dogs and the law are within the larger category of Animal law.|$|E

The stress could modify the physiological function and mask the symptom of an illness, or make the dog aggressive (1). Aims: Comparing the endocrine and behavioral response of dogs during the visit to the veterinary hospital and during activities in other places that {{are not related to}} stress (workplace, park). Materials and Methods: Six dog were taken in consideration, as indicators of stress there were used urinary cortisol, and behavioral observations. Results: Five of six dogs got high values of urinary cortisol after the visit to the veterinary clinic comparing with the values obtained in working spaces/park – areas that were familiar for dogs. Behavioral data’s have indicated a hesitating behavior at the entrance of the clinic and also in the examination room for all dogs, but the levels of intensity range individually for each dog. The results of the „Clinic Dog Stress Scale” classify behavior of dogs in following categories: 1 dog had score of 1 point that means a calm, relaxed dog; 2 dogs- 3 points that means a middle level of stress, the dog is tense but cooperative; 2 dogs got 4 points-very tense, difficult to maneuver, and one dog 5 points that means a high level of distress [...] Conclusion: Studding behavior relating with stress and the endocrine response at the veterinary visit it has importance for <b>animal,</b> <b>owner</b> and veterinary doctor.

40|$|Early {{detection}} of disease by an <b>animal</b> <b>owner</b> may motivate them to seek early veterinary advice. Presentation before {{a more advanced}} clinical manifestation is evident could lead to more effective treatment and thus benefit the animal's health and welfare. Accelerometers are able to detect changes in specific activities or behaviours, thus indicating early signs of possible adverse health events. The objective of this validation {{study was to determine}} whether the {{detection of}} eight behavioural states: walk, trot, canter/gallop, sleep, static/inactive, eat, drink, and headshake, by an accelerometer device was sufficiently accurate to be useful in a clinical setting. This fully independent external validation estimated the accuracy of a specific triaxial, collar-mounted accelerometer on a second-by second basis in 51 healthy dogs of different breeds, aged between 6 months and 13 years, weighing > 10 kg. The overall diagnostic effectiveness was estimated as: % record correctly classified of > 95 % in walk, trot, canter/gallop, eat, drink and headshake and > 90 % in sleep and static/inactive. The positive predictive values ranged from 93 - 100 %, while the negative predictive values ranged from 96 - 100 %, with exception of static/inactive (86 %). This was probably because dogs were placed in unfamiliar kennels where they did not exhibit their typical resting behaviour. The device is worn on a collar, making its use feasible for anyone wanting to monitor their dog's behaviour.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the presence and prevalence of Streptococcus (S.) agalactiae in Mauritanian camels. Twenty seven camel herds from 8 Mauritanian regions were included in the study, whereby a total of 276 milk samples and 104 udder skin swaps were investigated for S. agalactiae. S. agalactiae was isolated from 25 out of 27 investigated camel herds. A total of 41 S. agalactiae strains where isolated, 29 isolates from the milk samples and 12 isolates from the udder skin. Most of the strains (40 out of 41) were derived from animals with mastitis, udder skin lesions and emaciated animals. Only one strain was isolated from a clinically healthy animal. None of the isolated S. agalactiae strains was resistant to penicillin, but 53. 3 % of these strains were resistant to tetracycline. The last observation may be attributed to the uncontrolled use of the antibiotic agent by the herd owners. In order to decrease the prevalence of S. agalactiae in Mauritanian camel herds the following measures are recommended: 1.

40|$|The Swedish wolf {{population}} is like {{continue to grow}} and this will eventually {{lead to an increase}} in the predation of livestock. In Sweden carnivore attacks happen most frequent on sheep farms and the majority of these attacks are performed by wolves. Because of this, the main focus in this study is on the sheep and wolf problematic. It is not only the direct killing of livestock that affects the animals and their owners in a negative way. It has also been shown that livestock that lives close to carnivores sometimes change their behaviour {{in a way that will}} affect their ability to reproduce and to forage efficiently. Carnivores may also originate stress among livestock which in worst case scenario can lead to stress related diseases like ulcer, arteriosclerosis and heart attacks. Besides from the economic losses and the reduced welfare of livestock, the mental well-being of the <b>animal</b> <b>owner</b> may also be lowered because of the anxiety they feel for their animals. There are many methods that can be used to keep carnivores away from livestock. Some examples are electric fences, fladdry, guardian dogs, protection collars, bonding of sheep to cattle, translocation of carnivores and hunting. The using of guardian dogs is a new phenomenon in Sweden and has not yet been used on many farms, maybe because education of the dogs is difficult and time consuming. Electric fencing is the method that is used to the greatest extent in Sweden and is considered to be the most effective way to prevent carnivore attacks.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Narrowing the awareness-preparedness gap in bushfires (wildfires) {{means that}} new {{strategies}} and tactics {{will be needed}} to improve human safety and survival in this increasingly frequent and severe globally significant natural hazard. One {{way to do this is}} to explore the peri-event experiences of novel demographic groups living and working in at-risk areas to determine how best to strengthen a collaborative, mutually beneficial interface with emergency responders. Thus, this study included participants from one novel demographic, <b>animal</b> <b>owners,</b> in combination with emergency responders. <b>Animal</b> <b>owners</b> themselves are a large, diverse group whose preparedness and response behavior has not been assessed with respect to their potential contribution to contemporary natural hazard management. METHOD: Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions from four emergency responder classifications who were asked about their perceptions of <b>animal</b> <b>owners</b> in bushfire. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis because of its flexibility and suitability to this pragmatic qualitative study. Results from the first of 10 themes, chosen for its "overview" properties, are discussed in this paper, and indicate that exploring the animal owner-emergency responder interface has the potential to generate useful additions to public policy and expansion of social theory. CONCLUSION: Analysis of these data in this paper supports the potential for positive outcomes gained by reciprocal collaboration between <b>animal</b> <b>owners</b> and emergency responders.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} system {{is one of}} the three major body systems. When an animal in a critical state arrives at the animal hospital, {{it is important to know}} the normal parameters in order to assess the patient’s cardiovascular status. Triage is a process where you considerate the patient’s condition instead of check in time, or other criteria. Many critically ill patients suffer cardiovascular disorders at the time of clinical examination. These disorders can lead to multiple organ failure and death if not addressed. A successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a team effort where the veterinary nurse has an important role. The purpose of our report is to shed light on what cardiovascular disorders are and the veterinary nurse’s part in the treatment of the disease in the critical state. Advanced animal care is an essential element for the care of the critically ill patient. It is important to distinguish different types of shock because treatments can vary. In most situations, the type of shock can be discerned by careful examination. Regardless of the type of shock, the treatment is always aimed at maximizing oxygen delivery and to provide fluid therapy. The jugular vein is an effective access port for administring both infusions and drugs that also can be used for blood sampling and monitoring. This report describes function of monitoring equiment, the normal parameters of the animal, life-supporting measures, drugs and the veterinary nurse’s role in the treatment of dogs and cats. The report also includes a discussion of arguments as to why the <b>animal</b> <b>owner</b> may choose to refrain from resuscitation and why defibrillation isn’t as frequently used in veterinary medicine as in human medicine.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{candidate}} thesis is to obtain an overall picture of how many prohibitions against owning or taking care of animals that were announced in Sweden in the years 2006 - 2008 and on what basis these judicial decisions were taken. What is the situation for the person behind the judicial decisions? Is there a so-called risk category where preventive actions {{to solve the problem}} can be taken at an earlier stage? The first Swedish animal welfare legislation came into force in 1944. Previously there was a law of 1857 that only prohibited the maltreatment of farm animals. In 1988 the existing animal welfare law was revised into an in principle new law (1988 : 534). As early as in the Royal Majesty’s government bill (1944 : 43) to the 1944 animal welfare legislation, there was a proposal that issued prohibition for those having been convicted of aggravated cruelty to animals. This proposal, however, was excluded from the final legislation because the industry associations strongly opposed it. In the years that followed it became apparent that it was difficult to handle and manage repeated, serious animal welfare issues that arose, and a government bill with a proposal of a prohibition against owning animals was presented. This led to the concept ‘prohibition of owning and taking care of animals’ being introduced into the animal welfare law in 1969. The provision was then moved over to the new animal welfare law (1988 : 534), in principle without changes. In my work I have reviewed 524 pieces of decisions taken by the Swedish county administrative boards in the years 2006 - 2008 and of these I have used 494 pieces in the following analyses. The number of decisions differed considerably between the county administrative boards, to some extent depending on county size and number of existing keepers. At the top is Västra Götaland with 74 prohibitions, which the majority (33 pieces) taken in 2008. In my work, I have only found 14 prohibitions where the individual has stated abuse problems (drugs), 11 pieces with an alcohol problem and 7 with mental illness. These relatively low figures suggest {{that it is difficult to}} identify a so-called risk group, where special efforts are needed. The decisions vary greatly in layout and information between the various county administrative boards. This can be a contributing factor to the low number of abuse or other social or medical problems found in the picture. To get an overall insight and be able to form an opinion about the possible underlying problems of each individual <b>animal</b> <b>owner,</b> one must have access to extensive background information in each file, which is not the case in the majority of these decisions. The most common animal that the decision of prohibition of owning or taking care of animals is attended for is the category "animals". This means that the individual is forbidden to keep any kind of animals regardless of species. This is applicable at 268 pieces of the decisions.   The most common animal in terms of possession is beef cattle, which account for about 80 pieces of the decisions. Dairy cows account for only 12 pieces of the decisions in terms of possession and are not specified on the prohibitions...|$|E
40|$|Inflammations of the udder and {{permanently}} elevated somatic cell counts {{belong to the}} most significant reasons for remonting cows on dairy farms. A major part of these animals is sent to slaughter. At the abattoir, it is practically not possible to reliably tell that these cows have an udder disease. It is still largely unknown whether – in the tissues of animals with clinical or subclinical mastitis– there is an increased concentration of microorganisms that may even be on concern with regard to food hygiene vis-à-vis the tissue of dairy cows that present no signs of an infection and apparently healthy udders {{at the time of}} slaughter. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether the tissue of dairy cows that are slaughtered with clinical mastitis, subclinical mastitis or elevated somatic cell counts displays an elevated bacterial content at a concentration that would be of concern for consumers. For this purpose, 54 cows for slaughter were clinically examined in the dairy farm before being transported to the abattoir; quarter milk samples were taken and a short case report was made. After slaughter, samples of udder tissue, iliofemoral lymph nodes and musculature were taken and microbiologically examined. Milk samples were also examined. Twenty-seven (27) of the cows had clinical mastitis, 21 had elevated somatic cell counts without any clinical inflammation of the udder being present and 6 cows were control animals with apparently healthy udders. The results of the microbiological examination were then evaluated, together with the data gathered in the farm they originated from. Cows with clinical udder inflammation had a significantly higher bacterial count in their udder tissue than animals with elevated somatic cell counts without clinical mastitis and the control animals. Increased bacterial counts in lymph nodes and muscle tissue samples in animals with clinical mastitis vis-à-vis the animals of the two other groups could, on the other hand, not be statistically proven. Only in one cow with clinical mastitis could the bacteria found in the udder also be isolated from the muscle tissue. Both tissues contained A. pyogenes and Enterobacteriaceae, just as the lymph nodes did. In 11 animals, the bacterial microflora in the udder and lymph node samples corresponded. This affected 10 dairy cows with clinical mastitis and one control animal. The bacteria confirmed were S. uberis, A. pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae and St. aureus. The spectrum of bacteria isolated from the milk and tissue samples mainly comprised typical mastitis agents, among them also some human pathogens with the potential to cause illnesses of varying degrees of seriousness, such as enterococci, St. aureus, Bacillus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. The findings suggest that the practice of slaughtering cows suffering from mastitis does not generally represent any potential threat to the consumer. Blood-udder barrier and downstream lymph nodes appear to represent an effective system that prevents mastitis agents from the udder spreading to the musculature. It can be assumed that the legal rules regarding the placing on the market of milk (living animal) could possibly make the <b>animal</b> <b>owner</b> part with an animal. Consequently, however, it might be precisely these mechanisms that lead to a conflict with the food chain information system, according to which an animal may not be slaughtered for human consumption if it represents an (as yet unclear) potential threat or risk to consumers. The detection of, in part, higher concentrations of bacteria in the udder, even those belonging to animals with healthy udders, also raises the question of whether the udders of dairy cows should generally be viewed as unfit for human consumption. Such a requirement is, above all, underpinned by the circumstance that human-pathogenic bacteria were also detected in many udder samples...|$|E
