5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting <b>a</b> <b>thriller</b> that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E

2500|$|South Indian film columnists {{may have}} been using the term prior to their North Indian counterparts. G. Dhananjayan called the 2009 Tamil {{language}} film Achchamundu! Achchamundu!

5|$|Kajol {{made her}} acting debut {{at the age}} of {{seventeen}} in the 1992 romantic drama Bekhudi alongside debutante Kamal Sadanah and her mother Tanuja, who in the film also played her mother.

Although the film {{turned out to be a}} box office flop, Kajol's performance was noticed and she was signed for Baazigar (1993), <b>a</b> <b>thriller</b> by Abbas-Mustan, which emerged as a major commercial success. Inspired from the Hollywood film A Kiss Before Dying, the film co-starred Shah Rukh Khan, Shilpa Shetty and Siddharth Ray, and saw Kajol portray the leading role of Priya Chopra, a girl who falls in love with her sister's murderer.

5|$|She portrayed {{a wealthy}} {{university}} patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama Dark Matter, {{a film about}} a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired {{by the events of}} the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller Rendition (2007), directed by Gavin Hood.

5|$|During Clarke's absence, {{deception}} hierarchy in Middle East Command {{had become}} muddled. Colonel Ralph Bagnold {{had taken over}} deception planning, pushing 'A' Force aside. Clarke was sent to El Alamein, where Allied forces were on the retreat, to work on deception plans. Upon his return, Bagnold was sidelined and 'A' Force reinstated as the primary deception department. Throughout 1942 Clarke implemented Operation Cascade, an order of battle deception which added many fictional units to the Allied formations. Cascade was a success; {{by the end of}} the war the enemy accepted most of the formations as real. From 1942 to 1945, Clarke continued to organise deception in North Africa and southern Europe. After the war, he was asked to record the history of 'A' Force. He retired in 1947 and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity. As well as pursuing a literary career that produced two histories and <b>a</b> <b>thriller,</b> he worked for the Conservative Party and was a director of Securicor. He died in London in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Opening across 2,602 North American theaters, The Boy Next Door was {{projected}} {{to pull in}} $12–15million over its opening weekend. The film earned $5.7million on its opening day, well over its budget. It opened at number two at the US box office, with an opening weekend gross of $14.9million, {{significantly higher than the}} other new releases for that week. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that 45 percent of the film's opening week audience was Hispanic, while 71 percent of the overall audience was female. The film became Lopez's best opening weekend for a January release, beating her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (2001) which opened with $13.5million. It was also her best opening weekend for <b>a</b> <b>thriller</b> film, ahead of Angel Eyes (2001, $9.2million), Enough (2002, $14million), and Parker (2013, $7million). Furthermore, it is Lopez's biggest live-action opening since 2005's Monster-in-Law.

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed <b>a</b> <b>thriller.</b> He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
