Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|Neorealism ("The {{world is}} made of {{ordinary}} objects.") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical pilot wave which {{must be able to}} travel faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment.|$|E
5|$|The regimental colours of green, red and yellow, {{which appear}} on the regimental tie and Stable belt, were decided on in the late 19th century. One officer (who was also a Conservative MP) {{suggested}} green with a red stripe, but this was objected to because it {{was similar to the}} Rifle Brigade. Another officer (a Liberal MP) suggested adding yellow, which was agreed. The joke was that red and yellow were Liberal colours, and the Liberal MP got <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> under his rival's nose.|$|E

Unwilling to wait any longer, Cal ordered his assassins to stab Goodman {{to death in the}} street, whereupon he {{automatically}} succeeded to the city's highest office. He had Judge Dredd shot and the mayor arrested, and immediately began a despotic reign of terror. By this time the power had gone to his head and he became openly insane. He appointed his own pet goldfish to the vacant position of deputy chief judge, and made criticising the chief judge a capital offence. He was able to get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> because he had brainwashed the majority of the judges into obeying his every order.|$|E
25|$|In the one-day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport {{commentator}} Jonathan Agnew {{stated that}} Hales' technique {{was simply too}} fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump and playing with a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales could get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack. In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England {{went on to win}} the game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2-1.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known mass by any composer {{using this}} method of composition– the soggetto cavato– is the Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae, which Josquin probably wrote in the early 1480s for the powerful Ercole I, Duke of Ferrara. The notes of the cantus firmus are drawn from the musical syllables of the Duke's name in the following way: Ercole, Duke of Ferrara in Latin is Hercules Dux Ferrarie. Taking the solmization syllables with the same vowels gives: [...] (in modern nomenclature: [...] ). Another mass using this technique is the Missa La sol fa re mi, based on the musical syllables contained in [...] "Lascia fare mi" [...] ("let me do it"). The story, as told by Glareanus in 1547, was that an unknown aristocrat used to order suitors <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> phrase, and Josquin immediately wrote an [...] "exceedingly elegant" [...] mass on it as a jab at him.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Welles met and befriended Spanish film {{producer}} Emiliano Piedra, {{who wanted to}} work with him. Piedra did not think a Shakespearian film was marketable enough and proposed that Welles make a version of Treasure Island instead. Welles agreed [...] to this on condition that he could simultaneously make Chimes at Midnight, and Piedra agreed not knowing that Welles had no intention of making Treasure Island. Although some B-roll footage of the Alicante departing from port was shot early in the production, no scenes from Treasure Island were ever shot or even scripted. Welles got <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> trick throughout pre-production by building sets {{that could be used in}} both films, such as Mistress Quickly's Boar's Head Tavern, which would double as the Admiral Benbow Inn. Welles also cast each actor in both films, casting himself as Long John Silver, Baxter as Dr. Livesey, Beckley as Israel Hands and Gielgud as Squire Trelawney. Ironically Welles would eventually play Long John Silver in the unrelated 1972 film version of Treasure Island.|$|E
