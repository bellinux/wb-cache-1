Smith and Jayson however were not overtly overruled and Harrison is regarded as made per incuriam or at least a badly worded setting out of the rule found in Woollin.

5000|$|On January 23, 2009, Johnson {{was sentenced}} to six {{additional}} {{years in prison for}} an additional charge of theft by receiving and financial identity fraud for using the stolen card to purchase a meal from a local Burger King. Circuit Judge William Storey told Johnson, [...] "You continue to run afoul of the law. I am hopeful this is the last time." [...] That brought Johnson's combined state sentences to 18 years. In February 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court granted Johnson leave to appeal his sentence by saying that the trial judge should not have <b>admitted</b> <b>evidence</b> of the juvenile convictions during the sentencing phase of the theft and possession trial. Johnson will have to complete his federal sentence of four years after serving his 18-year state sentence. He could have remained incarcerated well into his thirties but was eligible for parole from his Arkansas sentence in 2011, after which he served the four-year federal sentence. In February 2016, ABC News reported online that Johnson was released in July 2015 into the custody of the US Probation Office for the Southern District of Texas and placed in a drug rehabilitation program.

He expected that those documents would be ready in time to be despatched to England next week'.One of the documents which must shortly go forward to London is an affidavit in support of the application. This must be signed by Sodeman, whose present reprieve expires on May 4, for which day the execution has been fixed.

40|$|For decades, courtrooms {{around the}} world have <b>admitted</b> <b>evidence</b> from {{forensic}} science analysts, such as fingerprint, tool-mark and bite-mark examiners, in order to solve crimes. Scientific progress, however, has led to significant criticism of the ability of such disciplines to engage in individualization i. e., “match” suspects exclusively to evidence. Despite this, American courts largely reject legal challenges based on arguments that identification evidence provided by these forensic science disciplines is unreliable. In so holding, these courts affirm precedent that it is the adversarial system’s function to weed out frailties in forensic evidence, and find that criticism of the forensic sciences lacks sui generis qualities. This article provides an independent critique of relevant American case law, from which three themes emerge. These themes are (1) the law’s misuse of science; (2) law’s scepticism towards change; and (3) law’s narrow construction of rationality, which generates reductionist concepts, and divorces science from its social context. As such, this article shows how the American judiciary’s approach to this global issue provides a contemporary illustration of key institutional tensions between science and law, and offers some recommendations for reforms that aim to facilitate the legal process to utilize the most reliable forensic science evidence possible...|$|E

Why should poetry, perhaps the most powerful maker of myth and in the Yugoslavia context, a great mover of dangerous men and women, be any different in the eyes of international law?

40|$|Police {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} at John Rosky’s apartment {{as part of an}} investigation into the sexual assault of a 13 -year-old girl. Two police officers eventually drove Rosky to a police substation for questioning but they did not formally arrest him or administer Miranda warnings. Police informed Rosky that his participation was voluntary and that he was free to leave at any time. At one point during the questioning, Rosky took a ten-minute break and went outside the police station unaccompanied by the detectives. The detectives used mild forms of deception and confronted Rosky with their belief that he was guilty. Approximately 1 ½ hours into the interview, Rosky admitted to a brief consensual act of sexual intercourse with the 13 - year-old girl. Rosky was arrested after the interview and released on bail. However, Rosky failed to appear in court. Authorities eventually located him in Mexico and obtained extradition. At trial, Rosky moved to suppress his confession because the officers did not administer Miranda warnings and his statements were made involuntarily. The district court concluded that Miranda did not apply because the statements were elicited in a non-custodial setting and that Rosky made the statements voluntarily. The district court also <b>admitted</b> <b>evidence</b> that Rosky fondled and digitally penetrated a 12 -year-old girl ten years earlier. The district court ruled that the prior bad act was admissible as part of a common scheme or plan and as modus operandi. Also at trial, the court instructed the jury on flight. Rosky was convicted of sexual assault and indecent exposure. Rosky appealed asserting that the district court committed reversible error by (1) denying his motion to suppress the statement he made to police, (2) admitting prior bad act testimony, and (3) instructing the jury on flight...|$|E
40|$|Allodynia (pain in {{response}} to normally non painful stimulation) and paresthesia (erroneous sensory experience) are two debilitating symptoms of neuropathic pain. These stem, at least partly, from profound changes in the non-nociceptive sensory pathway that comprises large myelinated neuronal afferents terminating in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. Further than neuronal changes, well <b>admitted</b> <b>evidence</b> indicates that glial cells (especially in the spinal cord) are key actors in neuropathic pain, in particular the possible alteration in astrocytic capacity to reuptake neurotransmitters (glutamate and GABA). Yet, the possibility of such a changed astrocytic scavenging capacity remains unexplored in the dorsal column pathway. The present study was therefore undertaken to assess whether peripheral nerve injury (spared nerve injury model, SNI) could trigger a glial reaction, and especially changes in glutamate and GABA transporters, in the gracile nucleus. SNI surgery was performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Seven days after surgery, rats were used for immunofluorescence (fixation and brain slicing), western-blot (fresh brain freezing and protein extraction) or GABA reuptake on synaptosomes. We found that SNI results in a profound glial reaction in the ipsilateral gracile nucleus. This reaction was characterized by an enhanced immunolabelling for microglial marker Iba 1 as well as astrocytic protein GFAP (further confirmed by western-blot, p < 0. 05, n = 7). These changes were not observed in sham animals. Immunofluorescence and western-blot analysis shows that the GABA transporter GAT- 1 is upregulated in the ipsilateral gracile nucleus (p < 0. 001; n = 7), with no detectable change in GAT- 3 or glutamate transporters EAAT- 1 and EAAT- 2. Double immunoflurescence shows that GAT- 1 and GFAP colocalize within the same cells. Furthermore, the upregulation of GFAP and GAT- 1 were shown to occur all along the rostrocaudal axis of the gracile nucleus. Finally, synaptosomes from ipsilateral gracile nucleus show an increased capacity to reuptake GABA. Together, the data presented herein show that glial cells in the gracile nucleus react to neuropathic lesion, in particular through an upregulation of the GABA transporter GAT- 1. Hence, this study points to role of an increased GABA transport in the dorsal column nuclei in neuropathic pain, calling attention to GAT- 1 as a putative future pharmacological target to treat allodynia and paresthesia...|$|E
