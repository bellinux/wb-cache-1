40|$|Silvering of {{nectarine}} {{fruit is}} a kind of damage caused by thrips feeding on ripening fruit. It is due to thrips infestation occurring during a month before presumed harvest. This damage is more frequent and serious on brightly coloured varieties which ripen between the end of June and the end of July. A study of the control of thrips infestation on nectarines was carried out over a 3 -year period in Emilia-Romagna Region (northern Italy). Thrips populations on sprouts were monitored starting from May up until the harvest in July. Over the last two years thrips populations were also sampled on fruit during the harvest. A significant correla-tion between the density of thrips populations on fruits and fruit damage was found. The thrips species recorded was Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), along with a variable percentage (0 - 55 %) of other Thrips spp. over the 3 -year period. A total of five pesticides were evaluated (<b>Acrinathrin,</b> Chlorpyriphos-methyl, Ethofenprox, Phosmet and Spinosad). <b>Acrinathrin</b> and Spinosad proved to be most effective against thrips, particularly when a high relative abundance of thrips was present...|$|E
40|$|Foliar {{sprays of}} {{pesticides}} are frequently {{used to control}} two-spotted mites on rose flowers, but these also destroy predatory mites and pose {{a high risk of}} contamination for humans and the environment. Using a novel approach to avoid spray applications on rose plants, modified acaricide-treated string curtains were adapted to control the pest. Two main aims of this study were: (i) to identify the lethal concentration of string curtains treated with propargite, dicofol, flufenoxuron, <b>acrinathrin</b> or taufluvalinate (s-fluvalinate) on Tetranychus urticae, and (ii) to test the design (feasibility) and efficiency of the string curtains to trap the phytophagous mites on the plants during their circadian migration. Bioassay results in the lab confirmed T. urticae circadian migration, toxicity of the five kinds of treated string curtains and a concentration-dependent repellent effect of each chemical on T. urticae females. Of the two products tested in the field, dicofol was more effective than <b>acrinathrin</b> in controlling T. urticae compared to an acaricidal spray of the same products. The effect of acaricide-treated string curtain use on Phytoseiulus persimilis did not differ significantly from the control. The string curtain technique proved to be effective, but because of some biotic and abiotic constraints and the low economic threshold of mites, even for the commercialized high canopy stem roses, the present device could be more appropriate for another horticultural crop, e. g. tomato.

The Italian Ministry of Agricultural Resources and Forestry financed the “AMA” Project (Ape-Miele-Ambiente) with the aim to intensify researches on toxicological impacts of pesticides on Apoidea. Within this project, we tried to develop an extended laboratory bioassay to evaluate the effects of insecticides and acaricides on bum-blebees. In order to record the behaviour and mortality of bumblebee workers after exposure to plants sprayed with pesticides, special cages offering the bees ample flying space, were built. Prior being transferred into the cages, potted flowering cucumber (Cu-cumis sativus) plants were sprayed with different pesticides at the field rate. Three different classes of pesticides were tested: phosphorganics (chlorpyriphos-methyl, dichlorvos, dimethoate, heptenophos and quinalphos), azotorganics (ethiofencarb and imidacloprid) and pyrethroids (<b>acrinathrin</b> and bifenthrin).
