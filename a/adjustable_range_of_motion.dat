Results Participants are classified into 3 groups by age (group 1, 20 — 40 years; group 2, 40 — 65 years; group 3, over 65 years). Stability index and postural sway is significantly increased with aging. Ankle plantarflexor strength and ankle eversion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> is significantly decreased with aging.

A goniometer {{is the most}} reliable tool to assess <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> yet, the lack of consistency in reporting prevents comparison between studies. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify how <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> is currently assessed and reported in Dupuytren’s disease literature. Following analysis recommendations for practice will be made to enable consistency in future studies for comparability. This paper highlights the variation in <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> reporting in Dupuytren’s disease. Methods A Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study design format was used for the search strategy and search terms. Surgery, needle fasciotomy or collagenase injection for primary or recurrent Dupuytren’s disease in adults were included if outcomes were monitored using <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> to record change. A literature search was performed in May 2013 using subject heading and free-text terms to also capture electronic publications ahead of print. In total 638 publications were identified and following screening 90 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data was extracted and entered onto a spreadsheet for analysis. A thematic analysis was carried out to establish any duplication, resulting in the final <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> measures identified. Results <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> measurement lacked clarity, with goniometry reportedly used in only 43 of the 90 studies, 16 stated the use <b>of</b> a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> protocol. A total of 24 different descriptors were identified describing <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> in the 90 studies. While some studies reported active <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> others reported passive or were unclear. Eight of the 24 categories were identified through thematic analysis as possibly describing the same measure, ‘lack of joint extension’ and accounted for the most frequently used.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role <b>of</b> {{cervical}} spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> {{in the recovery}} from Whiplash Associated Disorders. In clinical practice, Health Care Professionals attach value to measurements <b>of</b> cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> for diagnostic, prognostic and treatment evaluation purposes. A systematic literature review found conflicting evidence as to whether cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> was a prognostic factor following a whiplash injury. Greater understanding of prognostic factors such as this may facilitate improvements in patient management. A second systematic literature review investigated {{the reliability and validity}} of methods for measuring cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion.</b> The Cervical <b>Range</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Motion</b> (CROM) device was found to be the most rigorously tested and clinimetrically promising method and was subsequently investigated for intra- and inter-observer reliability in a group of whiplashinjured individuals and found to be substantially reliable. The CROM device was utilised in a longitudinal cohort study of 599 whiplash-injured patients to investigate the prognostic value <b>of</b> cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> for neck painrelated disability and patient-reported recovery at short, medium and long-term follow-up. A patient-reported version <b>of</b> cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> was also evaluated as a prognostic factor. Although useful for explaining disability at the time of measurement, active, passive and patient-reported forms <b>of</b> cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> were not significant prognostic factors for poor outcome when other physical and psychosocial factors were accounted for. The clinical implication of this research is that if patients are experiencing reduced cervical spine <b>Range</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> a few weeks after their whiplash injury they will not necessarily have a poor outcome in the longer term as is commonly believed at present.

Goniometric measurements showed that the passive stretching had significantly increased the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the joints...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hip joint motion simulation method using accurate hip joint center and hip <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion.</b> We calculate the extreme hip joint <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> {{centered on the}} hip joint center (HJC) that is located by an automatic calculation algorithm on 3 D reconstructed surface models. We make 3 D bone surface models from CT (Computer Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The medical objective is to quantify hip kinematics in function of hip morphology. Because extreme <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motions</b> are evaluated from bones only, we can estimate the motions that are restricted by bones impingements by comparing the computed values with real extreme <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to clarify the {{combined}} effects of stretching and resistance training on the active and passive dorsiflexion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> ankle joint. Sixteen young adult men were randomly assigned to a training (n= 8) or a control (n= 8) group. The training group trained one leg for the combined program of static calf stretching and dorsiflexors resistance training program (STR+TR) and the other leg for static stretching program only (STR). The training group executed stretching of both legs every day and resistance training every other day for six weeks. After the training program, in STR+TR side, both active and passive dorsiflexion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motions</b> significantly (P< 0. 05) increased and also isometric maximal voluntary dorsiflexion torque increased, while in STR side, only passive dorsiflexion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> increased. In passive dorsiflexion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> increased dorsiflexion ROM was accompanied by increased tendon elongation not muscle elongation. In conclusion, the combined program of stretching for calf muscles and resistance training for dorsiflexors increases active as well as passive dorsiflexion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> while static calf stretching program is effective only for the increase in passive dorsiflexion <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|R
