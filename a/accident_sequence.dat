5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} <b>accident</b> <b>sequence</b> {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} capturing the uncertainty expressed by an Hazard Analysis (HA) expert team when estimating the frequencies and consequences of <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> and provides a sound mathematical framework for propagating this uncertainty to the risk estimates for these <b>accident</b> <b>sequences.</b> The uncertainty is readily expressed as distributions that can visually aid the analyst in determining the extent and source of risk uncertainty in HA <b>accident</b> <b>sequences.</b> The results also can be expressed as single statistics of the distribution in a manner analogous to expressing a probabilistic distribution as a point-value statistic such as a mean or median. The study discussed here used data collected during the elicitation portion of an HA on a high-level waste transfer process to demonstrate the techniques for capturing uncertainty. These data came from observations of the uncertainty that HA team members expressed in assigning frequencies and consequences to <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> during an actual HA. This uncertainty was captured and manipulated using ideas from possibility theory. The result {{of this study is}} a practical method for displaying and assessing the uncertainty in the HA team estimates of the frequency and consequences for <b>accident</b> <b>sequences.</b> This uncertainty provides potentially valuable information about <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> that typically is lost in the HA process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodology {{used in a}} quantitative hazard assessment of a nuclear weapon disassembly process. Potential <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> were identified using an accident-sequence fault tree based on operational history, weapon safety studies, a hazard analysis team composed of weapons experts, and walkthroughs of the process. The experts provided an initial screening of the <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> {{to reduce the number}} of <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> that would be quantified. The <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> that survived the screening process were developed further using event trees. Spreadsheets were constructed for each event tree, the <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> associated with that event tree were entered as rows on the spreadsheet, and that spreadsheet was linked to spreadsheets with initiating-event frequencies, enabling event probabilities, and weapon response probabilities. The probability and frequency distribution estimates used in these spreadsheets were gathered from weapon process operational data, surrogate industrial data, expert judgment, and probability models. Frequency distributions were calculated for the sequences whose point-value frequency represented 99 % of the total point-value frequency using a Monte Carlo simulation. Partial differential importances of events and distributions of accident frequency by weapon configuration, location, process, and other parameters were calculated...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{at the request of}} the USDOE/AL Dynamic Balancer Project Team to develop a set of representative <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> initiated by rapid seizure of the spindle shaft of the Schenck dynamic balancing machine used in the mass properties testing activities in Bay 12 - 60 at the Pantex Plant. This Balancer is used for balancing reentry vehicles. In addition, the study identified potential causes of possible spindle-shaft seizure leading to a rapid deceleration of the rotating assembly. These <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> extend to the point that the reentry vehicle either remains in stable condition on the balancing machine or leaves the machine with some translational and rotational motion. Fault-tree analysis was used to identify possible causes of spindle-shaft seizure, and failure modes and effects analysis identified the results of shearing of different machine components. Cause-consequence diagrams were used to help develop <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> resulting from the possible effects of spindle-shaft seizure. To make these <b>accident</b> <b>sequences</b> physically reasonable, the analysts used idealized models of the dynamics of rotating masses. Idealized physical modeling also was used to provide approximate values of accident parameters that lead to branching down different accident progression paths. The exacerbating conditions of balancing machine over-speed and improper assembly of the fixture to the face plate are also addressed...|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of FBI's investigation, because of the {{possibility}} that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, were able to conclude that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion. This conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took for the sound of the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the <b>accident</b> <b>sequence.</b> In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.|$|E

By carefully examining and analyzing the various scuff marks and grease patterns near the missing bolt, the CAB investigators concluded that the bolt had fallen out prior to the aircraft's disintegration and collision with the ground, and not {{as a result of the}} accident itself. Without the bolt in place, the elevator (when in boost mode) and hence the entire aircraft would become uncontrollable, leading the investigators to deduce that the bolt had fallen out, most likely by working itself loose, a short time prior to the beginning of the <b>accident</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E

To understand the impact of other factors on <b>accident</b> <b>sequences,</b> this thesis focuses on human and organizational factors instead of technical factors. The aimis to provide readers a method about how to model human and organizational factors of offshore lifting operation by a case study. Firstly, the risk model consists of Event Tree, Fault Tree and Bayesian network. Then, to measure the risk influence factors in the model, potential indicators are identified by researching the literature information. Next, there is a comparison and evaluation about how to model non-linear effects by Barrier and Operational Risk Analysis and Bayesian conditional probability. We predict that the Bayesian method is a more correct way to model non-linear effects. However, regardless of which method, the biggest challenge is how to obtain available datasets since there is no suitable datasets covering human and organizational factors.

40|$|Reentry {{vehicles}} (RVs) carrying warheads from {{ballistic missiles}} {{must be carefully}} balanced with the warhead in situ to prevent wobble as the RVs enter the earth`s atmosphere to prevent inaccuracy or loss of the warhead. This balancing is performed on a dynamic balancing machine that rotates the RV at significant angular velocities. Seizure of the spindle shaft of the machine could result in rapid deceleration of the rotating assembly, which could over-stress and shear bolts or other structures that attach the RV to the balancing machine. This could result in undesired motions of the RV and impact of the RV on equipment or structures in the work area.

40|$|Stress tests {{performed}} in Europe after accident at Fukushima Daiichi also required {{evaluation of the}} consequences of loss of safety functions due to station blackout (SBO). Long-term SBO in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) leads to severe <b>accident</b> <b>sequences,</b> assuming that existing plant means (systems, equipment, and procedures) are used for accident mitigation. Therefore the main objective was to study the accident management strategies for SBO scenarios (with different reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) leaks assumed) to delay the time before core uncovers and significantly heats up. The most important strategies assumed were primary side depressurization and additional makeup water to reactor coolant system (RCS). For simulations of long term SBO scenarios, including early stages of severe <b>accident</b> <b>sequences,</b> the best estimate RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3 and the verified input model of Krško two-loop PWR were used. The results suggest that for the expected magnitude of RCPs seal leak, the core uncovery during the first seven days could be prevented by using the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump and manually depressurizing the RCS through the secondary side. For larger RCPs seal leaks, in general this is not the case. Nevertheless, the core uncovery can be significantly delayed by increasing RCS depressurization...|$|R
