5|$|The {{new party}} was {{formally}} announced on 2 April after an LM convention. As the LM {{had already begun}} establishing an infrastructure while in the LCL, it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up momentum readily, presenting itself as a centrist moderate party, {{but it was never}} able to shed its reliance on Hall.|$|E
5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> the forward pass {{out of the}} air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|Hayward credits Besson with {{showing the}} {{collaboration}} between the Burgundians and the English more accurately than previous filmmakers. Many lines during scenes of Joan's trial are taken verbatim from Joan's real trial transcript. Joan is shown receiving both wounds she was given in real life (an arrow above the breast and later an arrow to the leg), and the film includes some of the 15th-century accounts associated with Joan, such as being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out Charles VII from {{among a group of}} his courtiers at Chinon. The examining of Joan's virginity was a real test Joan had to complete to prove her merit.|$|E

50|$|On lap 192, Bill Whittington {{crashed in}} turn 3. The crash {{set up a}} restart with three laps to go. Andretti lined up three cars behind Sullivan, and as the green came out, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>pick</b> off both lapped cars. With two laps to go, Sullivan had a {{comfortable}} 2.4-second lead. Andretti was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> close the gap, and Sullivan won his first Indy 500 by 2.477 seconds over Mario Andretti.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kick}} {{and a short}} return, Florida State began a drive at the Tech 34-yard line, {{seemingly}} in excellent field position. But on the first play of the State drive, the Seminoles were stopped for a loss. State was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a short gain on the second play, but on the third, Weinke was sacked {{for the third time}} in the game. After the Seminole punt and a touchback, Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first down with an option run to Stith, then Vick ran for a long gain and another first down at the Florida State 20-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush up the middle of the field, then Vick completed a first-down pass to Derek Carter inside the Seminole 10-yard line. Kendrick advanced the ball to the Seminole three-yard line, then Vick ran the remaining yardage for a touchdown. Following the extra point, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 2814 with 37 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> off one South Vietnamese paratrooper after another, some as they descended {{and others}} when their parachutes became {{stuck in the}} trees. Those paratroopers who reached the ground and survived tried to move forward, but the Viet Cong {{soldiers}} in defilade position fired on the paratroopers exposed in the open rice paddies. Undeterred, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion launched small-unit attacks, but on each occasion they were repelled, and sporadic fighting continued until sundown. By {{the end of the}} day, the airborne battalion had lost 19 soldiers killed in action and another 33 wounded. American advisers Captain Fletcher Ware and Sergeant Russell Kopti, who had parachuted in with the South Vietnamese, were also wounded. As night fell, Hoang knew that South Vietnamese forces were closing in from three directions. The eastern flank remained open, and he ordered both elements of the 261st and 514th Battalions, exhausted and low on ammunition, to assemble {{at the south end of}} Ap Tan Thoi. They evacuated through the rice fields, taking their dead and wounded comrades.|$|E

5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E
5|$|The second main feud {{heading into}} the event was between Kane and Shawn Michaels. This feud began the night after Bad Blood, when Michaels lost a Hell in a Cell match to Triple H. Raw {{commentator}} Jim Ross tried making amends between Michaels and Triple H by making them to shake hands. Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, however, Kane came out and attacked Michaels, which resulted in Kane, in storyline, crushing Michaels' throat with a wedged chair. Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention. On the June 28, 2004 edition of Raw, Ross interviewed Kane {{and asked him to}} explain his actions towards Michaels; Kane explained that he was robbed of the World Heavyweight Championship at Bad Blood against Chris Benoit, as Michaels got in his way, which angered him. On the August 30 edition of Raw, Kane revealed that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to him and Lita, who married the week before, was to name any match he wanted for the September pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Lita then informed Kane that Bischoff's present was for both of them, where they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> Kane's opponent for Unforgiven, which resulted in Michaels being picked.|$|E

50|$|The West Coast offense {{requires}} a quarterback who throws extremely accurately, and often blindly, {{very close to}} opposing players. In addition, it requires the quarterback <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>pick</b> the best one of five receivers to throw to, certainly {{much more quickly than}} in previously used systems. Often, the quarterback has no time to think about the play and must act robotically, executing the play exactly as instructed by the offensive coordinator, who calls the plays for him.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally Xing Yi was {{an armed}} art. Students would train {{initially}} with the spear, progressing to shorter weapons and eventually empty-handed fighting.
