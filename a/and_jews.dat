The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.|$|E

Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry.

To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets.
