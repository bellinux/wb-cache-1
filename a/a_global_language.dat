5000|$|Michael Morris {{argued that}} while {{it is clear that}} there is {{language}} hierarchy from the [...] "ongoing interstate competition and power politics", there is little evidence provided that shows that the [...] "global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>language</b> system, and that the entire system is held together by one global language, English". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed {{to be part of the}} international system but is [...] "notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance" [...] and therefore cannot be shown to exist. However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the hypercentral language English holds together the system must also be answered by such <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>language</b> system.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-twentieth century, when Gode led the {{development}} of Interlingua, the ideals underlying Esperanto had come to seem naive. Influenced by Herder, Gode propounded a Romantic, anti-positivist view of language: languages are {{an aspect of the}} culture of a people, not an instrument to achieve a goal; an ideology cannot be attached to a language, except artificially. This implied, in his view, that a world language on the Esperanto model was either impossible or, worse, achievable only through totalitarian coercion. He was of the opinion that, unless imposed by force, <b>a</b> universal <b>global</b> <b>language</b> would presuppose <b>a</b> universal <b>global</b> culture, which does not currently exist and is not necessarily desirable.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Panorama is a multidatabase system {{developed}} in HUST. The project aims to achieve interoperability among existing, heterogeneous, federated database management {{systems such as}} Oracle 8, Sybase, and DM 2 (A database management system developed at HUST, Wuhan, China). This system is based on OMG’s distributed object management architecture and it is implemented on top of CORBA compliant, namely VisiBroker, which is used as its infrastructure. Panorama can provide its users a single common data model and <b>a</b> single <b>global</b> query <b>language</b> named PanoSQL, which {{make it possible to}} incorporate different databases into the system. The main component of this system are interfaces for the Local DBMSs that participate in Panorama, a transaction manager, a commo n data model, a schema integrator, <b>a</b> <b>global</b> query <b>language,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>global</b> query processing and optimization. In this paper, we, first, discuss the architecture and components of Panorama system. We also discuss the schema integration in this system. And we extend our discussion to the query language, transaction management, and the query processing developed for this system. Finally, a conclusion and the future work for our designed system have been given...|$|R
