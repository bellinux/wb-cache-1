He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, Lieutenant Commander Hashimoto {{was given}} command of {{submarine}} I-58 {{which was still}} under construction in Sasebo. Hashimoto oversaw much {{of the construction of}} I-58. The submarine was later overhauled mid-construction to carry Kaiten manned torpedoes, which was considered <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> by Hashimoto's crew. I-58 was commissioned on 13 September 1944 and Hashimoto commanded her during her shakedown cruises, commanding his men on repeated drills without shore leave. He completed training on the submarine in December 1944. The ship traversed Shimonoseki Strait into the Inland Sea and to Kure for supplies. She then moved to Hirao where she loaded six kaitens.|$|E

5|$|Mt. St. Peter Parish has {{a branch}} of the Saint Vincent De Paul Society. The goal of this branch of the society, like all other branches, is to help the poor, the sick, and the suffering. Members of this group work to help people locally by {{collecting}} food and delivering it to food banks in and around New Kensington. Within the church, it is seen as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> {{to be part of this}} society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are more than in the caring acts they perform. They all work together to help others and they continually strive to become better Catholics.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> {{to be invited}} to live on The Lawn, and 54 fourth-year undergraduates do so each year, joining ten members of the faculty who permanently live and teach in the Pavilions there. Similarly, graduate students may live on The Range. Edgar Allan Poe formerly lived in 13 West Range, and since 1904 the Raven Society has retrofitted and preserved his room much as it may have existed in the 1820s.|$|E
25|$|For the {{traditional}} observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways {{of the school}} building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns. While rarely observed at home, parents often take time off work to watch these school processions in the morning, and if their child should be chosen Lucia it is considered <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor.</b> Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes.|$|E
50|$|The Streak {{became the}} {{cornerstone}} of WrestleMania, with a potential win over The Undertaker at the event being described as <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>honor</b> than winning the WWE Championship.

50|$|In 350, when Empress Dowager Chu was bestowing <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>honor</b> on Cai, Cai {{repeatedly}} declined—so much so that, as the emperor, the empress dowager, and {{the officials}} {{waited at the}} palace for the messengers that the empress dowager sent to his home to return with him, they waited from morning to evening, causing the seven-year-old emperor to be drained. Yin used this opportunity to accuse Cai of disrespect and had him excluded from government and reduced to commoner status.|$|R
25|$|The Zichen Hall, {{located in}} the inner court, is {{approximately}} 95 meters north of the Xuanzheng Hall. It housed the central government offices. For officials, it was considered <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> to be summoned to the Zichen Hall. The Taiye Pool, {{also known as the}} Penglai Pool, is north of the Zichen Hall. It expanded over 240 mu (40 acres or 0.16km²) and an island representing the mythical land of Penglai was built within it. The former gardens that surround the pond and island have been recreated, based on the historical record, with peony, chrysanthemum, plum, rose, bamboo, almond, peach, and persimmon gardens.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Torch Relay ends {{on the day}} of {{the opening}} {{ceremony}} in the central stadium of the Games. The final carrier is often kept unannounced until the last moment, and is usually a sports celebrity of the host country. The final bearer of the torch runs towards the cauldron, often placed at the top of a grand staircase, and then uses the torch to start the flame in the arena. It is considered to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> to be asked to light the Olympic flame. After being lit, the flame continues to burn throughout the Games, until the day of the closing ceremony and celebration, when it is finally put out, symbolizing the official end of the Games.|$|E
25|$|In Romania and Moldova, Epiphany, {{is called}} Boboteaza. In {{south-eastern}} Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races. Before the race, the men {{line up with}} their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day. A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or better yet falls into water- on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out.|$|E
5000|$|Evans {{also won}} the Western Open in 1910 by {{defeating}} George Simpson 6 and 5 in the 36-hole final. He was the only amateur to do so until Scott Verplank in 1985. Simpson graciously praised Evans on his victory, saying “I’ve learned the greatest golf lesson of my life today. I consider it <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>honor</b> to be beaten {{by the kind of}} golf you have played than to have remained out of the tournament because I did not fancy match play.” ...|$|R

Such events historically often took place either at home openers or on Old-Timers' Day, but have lately been scheduled on separate weekend home games.

30|$|I {{consider}} Dr. Robert Bell (1841 – 1917) to be {{the father}} of boreal forest fire ecology and fire behaviour in Canada.

25|$|At the time, Prague had {{the third}} largest {{university}} clinic in the German speaking world and it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> for Kocher when he received a call as a professor to Prague in spring 1880. Many colleagues, especially international ones, urged Kocher to accept while Bernese doctors and colleagues begged him to stay. Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new Inselspital building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and {{increased the number of}} beds for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying. The university students organized a torchlight procession on 8 June 1880 in his honor.|$|E
25|$|The marbles {{from the}} Late Archaic temple of Aphaia, {{comprising}} the sculptural {{groups of the}} east and west pediments of the temple, are on display in the Glyptothek of Munich, where they were restored by the Danish neoclassic sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. These works exerted a formative influence on the local character of Neoclassicism in Munich, as exhibited in the architecture of Leo von Klenze. Each pediment centered on the figure of Athena, with groups of combatants, fallen warriors, and arms filling the decreasing angles of the pediments. The theme shared by the pediments was the greatness of Aigina as shown by the exploits of its local heroes in the two Trojan wars, one led by Heracles against Laomedon and a second led by Agamemnon against Priam. According to the standard myths, Zeus raped the nymph Aigina, who bore the first king of the island, Aiakos. This king had the sons Telamon (father of the Homeric hero Ajax) and Peleus (father of the Homeric hero Achilles). The Greek idolize heroes who fallen at war, to dye on the battleground was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> it depicted courage and strength. When a hero died it was though that they become immortal because they prove themselves to the Gods. The sculptures preserve extensive traces of a complex paint scheme, and are crucial for the study of painting on ancient sculpture. The marbles are finished even on the back surfaces of the figures, despite the fact that these faced the pediment and were thus not visible.|$|E
25|$|Ndebunze, or Ndichie, are the {{deceased}} ancestors {{who are considered}} to be in the spirit world, àlà mmúọ́. In Odinani, it is believed that the dead ancestors are invisible members of the community; their role in the community, in conjunction with Ala, is to protect the community from epidemics and strife such as famine and smallpox. Ancestors helped chi look after men. Shrines for the ancestors in Igbo society were made in the central house, or òbí or òbú, of the patriarch of a housing compound. The patriarchal head of the household is in charge of venerating the patriarchal ancestors through libations and offerings, through this the living maintain contact with the dead. Only a patriarch whose father is dead, and therefore in the spirit world where they await reincarnation into the community, were able to venerate ancestors. Female ancestors were called upon by matriarchs. At the funeral of a mans father there is a hierarchy in Igbo culture of animals that will be killed and eaten in his honor. Usually this depended on the rarity and price of the animal, so a goat or a sheep were common and relatively cheaper, and therefore carried less prestige, while a cow is considered <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor,</b> and a horse the most exceptional. Horses cannot be given for women. Horses were more common among the northeastern Igbo due to tsetse fly zone that Igboland is situated in and renders it an unsuitable climate for horses. Horse heads are traditionally decorated and kept in a reliquary and at shrines.|$|E

5000|$|Garfield and his {{supporters}} knew they would face a difficult election {{without the support of}} the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination. Levi P. Morton, the first choice of Garfield's supporters, consulted with Conkling, who advised him to decline, which he did. They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing the Republicans would lose. Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, [...] "The office of the Vice-President is <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>honor</b> than I ever dreamed of attaining." [...] Conkling eventually relented, and campaigned for the ticket.|$|R

500|$|The Byzantine Empire {{considered}} Constantine {{its founder}} and the Holy Roman Empire reckoned him among the venerable figures of its tradition. In the later Byzantine state, {{it had become}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> for an emperor to be hailed as a [...] "new Constantine". Ten emperors, including the last emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, carried the name. Monumental Constantinian forms were used at the court of Charlemagne {{to suggest that he}} was Constantine's successor and equal. Constantine acquired a mythic role as a warrior against [...] "heathens". The motif of the Romanesque equestrian, the mounted figure in the posture of a triumphant Roman emperor, became a visual metaphor in statuary in praise of local benefactors. The name [...] "Constantine" [...] itself enjoyed renewed popularity in western France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The Orthodox Church considers Constantine a saint (Άγιος Κωνσταντίνος, Saint Constantine), having a feast day on 21 May, and calls him isapostolos (Ισαπόστολος Κωνσταντίνος)—an equal of the Apostles.|$|E
