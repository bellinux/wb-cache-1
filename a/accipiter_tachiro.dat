50|$|The African goshawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>tachiro)</b> is {{a species}} of African bird of prey in the genus Accipiter which is the type genus of the family Accipitridae.|$|E
50|$|Closely {{related to}} the African goshawk <b>Accipiter</b> <b>tachiro</b> and the red-chested goshawk Accipiter toussenelii, albeit smaller than either of those species. It is {{normally}} regarded as monotypic, although some authorities recognise the smaller birds in the Congo Basin as the subspecies Accipiter castanilius beniensis.|$|E

50|$|Outside of the Bubo genus, other owls in Africa {{are much}} smaller than Verreaux's eagle-owls {{and are more likely}} to be viewed as prey than competition. Among the small-to-mid-sized owls that have fallen prey to this species {{including}} the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the African grass owl (Tyto capensis), both of which average around 419 g in body mass in Africa, the 334 g marsh owl (Asio capensis) and the 216 g southern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis granti). The only verified interactions with other typical eagle-owls have been predatory, as the 645 g spotted eagle-owl has been recorded among their prey in a few cases. There are several owls was broadly similar habitat preferences from African scops owls (Otus senegalensis) to African wood owls (Strix woodfordii) that have not been reported as food but are almost certainly occasionally threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owls. As is commonly the case with eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owl is perhaps the most serious predatory threat to diurnal raptors in its range, most often ambushing raptors on their prominent nests upon nightfall and freely killing birds of prey of any age from nestlings to adults. Such prey is not quantitatively significant as a food source but since raptors as a rule are sparsely distributed the habitual visitation of a single or pair of Verreaux's eagle-owl can potentially be devastating to a local population. Among the species known to be attacked have included, among small-to-medium-sized raptors, include the 638 g African harrier-hawk (Polyboroides typus), the 675 g pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 507 g African marsh harrier (Circus ranivorus), the 110 g scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), the 291.5 g African goshawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>tachiro)</b> the 875 g common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the 640 g Wahlberg's eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi).|$|E
40|$|Winter radio-tracking {{of three}} African {{goshawks}} <b>Accipiter</b> <b>tachiro</b> showed that they each occupied well-wooded home ranges {{of at least}} 28 hectares. They perched and roosted mainly within densely foliaged trees and an adult female changed perches on &# 13; average 4, 7 times per hour. No crepuscular predation of bats was recorded, in contrast to regular summer predation on colonies of little free-tailed bats, Tadarida pumila, but winter emergence rates of these bats at dusk had dropped to < 5 of the previous summer. We predict that many accipiters will be regular predators of bats and that skewed sex ratios and high fecundity may be two means by which bats counter this predation...|$|E
