40|$|Abstract: When actions may {{generate}} {{negative externalities}} for third parties, there are incentives to pass these “morally tough ” decisions to others. In controlled laboratory experiments, we investigate how interaction {{in a market}} affects other-regarding allocation decisions when the right to divide a sum of money between oneself and a passive recipient becomes a tradable commodity. We find that allocation to passive recipients is reduced {{by more than half}} when determined by subjects who purchased or decided to keep the right to make the division as compared to a control treatment where subjects are directly assigned that right. We find further that the market selection mechanism allocates the right to make the division more frequently to buyers who allocate more to the recipient, but that sellers who allocate less to the recipient tend not to sell. Sellers have relatively accurate beliefs about how little the recipients receive and do not report feeling less responsible the more often they sell the <b>allocation</b> <b>right...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper deploys Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) to {{elaborate}} on the shortcomings of ‘mainstream ’ transfer pricing in multinational firms. Departing from the notion that multina-tionals increasingly (re-) organize their business along multinational value chains irrespective of jurisdictional borders, this paper discusses {{the nature of the}} multinational firm and the problem of choosing the right intra-group (transfer) price. The mainstream transfer pricing approach derived from the Arm’s Length Principle (ALP) is deemed inappropriate for globally operating multinational enterprises (MNEs). Referring to the value chain model, the paper suggests that ‘entrepreneurial coordination ’ is the key performance feature to be used for valuing business activity and for allocating — for tax transfer pricing purposes — standard mark-ups and residual profits along the value chain. The main findings of this paper are: Neo-classical concepts on marginal pricing may not suffice to establish arm’s length transfer pricing; the inadequacy between tax-world transfer pricing (getting income <b>allocation</b> <b>right)</b> and business-world transfer pricing (getting management incentives right) might find its explanation in such concepts. MNEs need to be understood as large organizations different from domestic larg...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{accurately}} or not, “rationing ” {{was frequently}} {{employed as a}} term of opprobrium during both the health reform debates and subsequent explosion in political vituperation. But whatever that word’s lingering stigma, there are unquestionably situations—long preceding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and almost certain to persist whether it is fully implemented or not—in which a fundamental imbalance between need and supply makes rationing of some health services inevitable. In such circumstances, some socially acceptable mechanism must be available to insure equitable and justifiable allocation processes.

40|$|Several European {{countries}} and Japan are {{in various stages}} of privatizing and/or introducing more competition in passenger rail service. This process has been furthered by a directive from the Commission of the European Communities (1991) requiring member states to separate operations from infrastructure on the books and give international groupings of trains access to their infrastructure. In the Netherlands, the Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management was assigned responsibility for making a recommendation to Parliament for choosing between competition for the rails and competition on the rails in increasing competition in the supply of passenger rail service. The Ministry commissioned the experiments reported here in order to acquire better understanding of the properties of the two alternative types of competition {{in the context of a}} simple stylized rail network. The experimental rail network includes station complementarity and time slot substitutability. It also includes tradeoffs between local and express trains.

In addition such models tend to also include testbed experimental data. Within this group there is {{a particular type of}} model that focuses on the analysis of access to the network which is essential to the liberalisation assessment. At the core of these models is the allocation of capacity slots allowing the detailed analysis of the relationship between infrastructure managers and railway operators using an auctions approach based on experiments. Cox et al. [15] used this approach to analyse competition involving <b>allocation</b> of <b>rights</b> to use station and time-slot routes by price bids in a combinatorial auction with competition involving <b>allocation</b> of <b>rights</b> to regional monopolies by fare-structure bids for supplying a pre-specified minimum schedule.

The present Paper uses contract theory to analyse the interplay of residual claims and control rights in private pensions.

The main control rights we examine relate to decisions on funding, asset allocation, and asset management. Under complete contracting, governance can {{be shown to be}} neutral: DC and DB plans differ only on risk allocation. If instead contracts are incomplete, a DB (DC) plan should: (1) Assign more vigilance responsibility to the sponsor (beneficiaries); (2) Rely less (more) on trustees; (3) Tend to employ trustees that are professional experts (caring insiders); (4) Assign asset <b>allocation</b> <b>rights</b> to the sponsor (beneficiaries); (5) have strict funding requirements. governance; pension fund; private pension...|$|R
