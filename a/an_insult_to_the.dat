5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{was present}} in January 1164 when the king summoned a council of the barons and the bishops to Clarendon, where the king demanded that both groups swear to uphold the royal rights of Henry's grandfather, King Henry I, without any {{reservations}} or conditions. Although Becket at first attempted to resist, he eventually submitted, and then forced the other bishops to swear also. In October 1164, Becket was accused of denying justice to a royal vassal, tried at a council held at Northampton, and was found guilty {{although he did not}} accept the sentence. During the trial, Robert attempted to moderate Becket's behaviour, by persuading him from having his archiepiscopal cross, a symbol of spiritual authority, carried in front of him when he entered the court, which would have been <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king. Shortly after the trial, Robert interceded with the king to order that no injury be done to Becket, who went into voluntary exile.|$|E

There is a substantial body of research suggesting that the morphology and responses to clinical interventions differ between these two sub-groups of ARDS [12 – 19]. Similarly, experimental models of ARDS may be separated into those that target the alveolar epithelium (analogous to ‘pulmonary’ ARDS) and those that target the vascular endothelium (i.e., ‘extrapulmonary’ ARDS).|$|R

5|$|The U.S. {{bombing of}} North Vietnam in February 1965 had a decisive {{impact on the}} Soviet Union's {{strategy}} in Vietnam. Since Ho Chi Minh and his Communist Party won control of North Vietnam in 1954, Ho's government had not always enjoyed cordial relations with their Soviet allies. For example, in 1957 the Soviet government proposed that both North and South Vietnam be given {{a seat in the}} United Nations, a move which would have undermined the North's claim as the sole legitimate government of the whole country. Then in February 1964, North Vietnam joined the People's Republic of China in refusing to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> policy of co-existence adopted by the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. By that time, however, Khrushchev had already begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam because of the growing conflict in the region was becoming more expensive for the Soviet Union, with North Vietnam relying more on it for large amounts of economic and military aid.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the centuries}} the {{interpretation}} of Mary as an ever virgin bride of the Lord who had taken a vow of perpetual chastity spread and was in full vogue {{by the time of}} Rupert of Deutz in the 12th century. By the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas had fashioned long and detailed theological arguments in defense of the doctrine and stated that a denial of the perpetual virginity of Mary would be derogatory to the perfection of Christ, <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit, and an affront to the dignity of the Mother of God.|$|E
25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted {{the rest of her}} life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was nothing to be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Chinese {{revolution}} of 1911, Sir Boshan and Ho Kai voted for {{an amendment to}} the Peace Preservation Ordinance which authorised the flogging of rabble-rousers in the prisons, in order to prevent any political and economic instability in Hong Kong, despite Wei and Ho supported the revolution. In April 1912, the Hong Kong government banned the circulation of Chinese coins as it feared the effects of the depreciation of Chinese coins after the revolution. In November, Governor May encouraged the Star Ferry and Hong Kong's two tramways stop accepting Chinese coins. Many Chinese took it as <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new Chinese republic and left the local residents with less money for tram fare. A colony-wide boycott broke out and Sir Boshan and Ho Kai defended the tram companies and condemned the boycott for harming the economies of both Hong Kong and Kwangtung in a meeting at the Chinese Commercial Union. The boycott ended by early February 1913 with the help from local Chinese merchants.|$|E
