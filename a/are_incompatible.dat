5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two <b>are</b> <b>incompatible.</b> This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between two {{cartridges}} via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading {{must be done}} to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red or Blue on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of the games <b>are</b> <b>incompatible</b> with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
5|$|Yoseph Yapi Taum, a {{lecturer}} at Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta, views Tini's aloof {{nature as a}} major force driving Tono to Yah; her lifestyle, of which Tono is not a part, alienates him and drives him to find a more traditional woman. Tham Seong Chee, a political scientist from Singapore, views her as a weak-willed character, unwilling to act before meeting Hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with Tono. He also sees her as being fettered by her own values, which <b>are</b> <b>incompatible</b> with those held by the general Indonesian populace. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Goenawan Mohamad views her as driven {{in part by the}} stress placed on her by her husband's expectations.|$|E

5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection <b>are</b> <b>incompatible</b> with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they <b>are</b> <b>incompatible,</b> she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is incompatible with}} {{the first and second}} boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both <b>are</b> <b>incompatible</b> with living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E

25|$|According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, {{the central}} {{difference}} between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both <b>are</b> <b>incompatible</b> as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal. Philosopher and physicist Victor J. Stenger's view is that science and religion <b>are</b> <b>incompatible</b> due to conflicts between approaches of knowing {{and the availability of}} alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.|$|E
5000|$|In a paper {{submitted}} to The Journal of Ethics entitled [...] "How to Think about the Problem of Free Will," [...] Van Inwagen {{worries that the}} concept [...] "free will" [...] may be incoherent.

And there are seemingly unanswerable arguments that ... demonstrate that free will <b>is</b> <b>incompatible</b> with indeterminism.
