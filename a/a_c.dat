40|$|Interaction {{effects of}} <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb on their {{respective}} bioaccessibility in co-contaminated soils were reported. In addition, {{the influence of}} aging time (up to 90 days) on potential interactions was also investigated. Experiments were carried out by spiking four diverse soils with single, binary or ternary mixtures of <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb. Soils were measured for bioaccessibility at different aging periods. Results demonstrate that bioaccessibility of <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb reached a steady state after soils were aged for 30 days. Bioaccessibility of <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb in soils spiked with binary mixtures of <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb were not affected by the other co-existing metal/metalloid. But when <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb were introduced together to acidic soils which lacked abundant binding sites, intestinal bioaccessibility of Cd was increased at the early stage of aging (7 to 30 days) whilst bioaccessibility of As and Pb remained unchanged. However, when Pb and As were added after Cd has been incubated in soil for 7 days, Cd intestinal bioaccessibility was not influenced by As and Pb. Therefore, {{a number of factors}} should be taken into consideration when estimating the bioaccessibility of mixed <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb, including the loadings of <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb in soils, the time for which they have been aged together and the time period between <b>As,</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb entering the soils...|$|R

25|$|Cebus a. versicolor is {{a complex}} which {{includes}} dark populations and lighter populations. It is thought to include the subspecies <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus and <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei. Herskovitz's description of <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei is of a very reddish animal, particularly in its limbs while <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor is <b>a</b> lighter red. <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus {{was described as a}} dark brown animal with reddish tonalities in the hind legs. Nevertheless, Hernández-Camacho and Cooper discuss evidence that the three subspecies (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus, <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei and <b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor) could be subsumed into one subspecies (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor), since the variations seem to be found in a very well-defined zone and even in the same groups, close to Barrancabermeja on the eastern bank of the middle Magdalena River in the Department of Santander. This strongly suggests that the dark phase (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> leucocephalus) and the light phase (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> pleei) are extremes of <b>an</b> intermediate (<b>C.</b> <b>a.</b> versicolor).|$|R

40|$|In {{studies that}} use {{electronic}} health record data, imputation of important data {{elements such as}} Glycated hemoglobin (<b>A</b> 1 <b>c)</b> has become common. However, few studies have systematically examined the validity of various imputation strategies for missing <b>A</b> 1 <b>c</b> values. We derived a complete dataset using an incident diabetes population that has no missing values in <b>A</b> 1 <b>c,</b> fasting and random plasma glucose (FPG and RPG), age, and gender. We then created missing <b>A</b> 1 <b>c</b> values under two assumptions: missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR).

The daily feed intake rate of shrimp at 25 +/- A 4 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> was the lowest, and the food conversion efficiency was also significantly lower than those at 25 +/- A 2 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> and 25 +/- A 3 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C,</b> respectively. The food conversion efficiency at 25 +/- A 2 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> or 25 +/- A 3 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> was significantly higher than those in other regimes. Thus, it can be inferred that the growth enhancement in the test shrimp at the suitable diel fluctuating temperatures was due to high food conversion efficiency. Studies of the physiological parameters showed that at 25 +/- A 4 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C,</b> the hemolymph glucose content of the test shrimp was the lowest, while the activity of PK in hepatopancreas was the highest, which indicated that the test shrimp at 25 +/- A 4 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> was in <b>a</b> stressed condition. The hemolymph glucose content of the test shrimp at 25 +/- A 3 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> was the highest, and the activity of HK in hepatopancreas was the lowest. These results indicated that the test shrimps at 25 +/- A 3 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> were not in a stressed condition. Compared with the constant temperature regime, the expression of HSP 70 in any of the four cyclical temperature change regimes was not significantly increased. The reason for this might be that the fluctuation amplitude of +/- A 4 <b>A</b> degrees <b>C</b> did not induce the increased expression of HSP 70...|$|R
