5|$|A grilled Italian sausage {{sandwich}} {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions <b>and</b> <b>peppers</b> or parmigiana style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets promotion in 1993, the chain introduced a grilled meatloaf sandwich with ketchup and onions in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst sandwich in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The sandwich featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of the steak sandwich have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak sandwich, and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak Sandwich which was almost identical to the 1979 sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian cuisine also {{includes}} many small pizza-like foods, including Manakish, sfiha, fatayer,sambusac and ikras. Sfiha is a baked miniature flatbread, topped with lamb and cooked red peppers or tomatoes. Manakish is a baked flat bread, usually topped with za'atar and olive oil. Sfiha are meat patties decorated with spices <b>and</b> <b>peppers.</b> Sambusac and fatayer are baked or sometimes fried doughs stuffed with minced meat and cooked onions or snobar (pine nuts). Fatayer is usually folded into triangles and unlike sambusac, {{it could be}} filled with arabic cheese or za'atar. Ikras is similar to sambusac and fatayer, by using dough stuffed with either meat or spinach, however they are not fried (like sambusac), and are usually served as a meal rather than meal addition or side dish.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), <b>and</b> <b>peppers</b> (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> shakers (or in the UK, salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> pots) are {{condiment}} dispensers used in Western {{culture that}} are designed to allow diners to distribute grains of edible salt and ground peppercorns.

50|$|Salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> is {{the common}} name for edible salt <b>and</b> black <b>pepper,</b> a {{traditionally}} paired set of condiments found on dining tables where European-style food is eaten. The pairing of salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> as table condiments dates to seventeenth-century French cuisine, which considered pepper the only spice (as distinct from herbs such as fines herbes) which did not overpower the true taste of food. They are typically found {{in a set of}} salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> shakers, often a matched set; however, salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> are typically maintained in separate shakers.|$|R

30|$|Pattern B: salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. Salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> {{noise is}} added to the {{original}} noiseless image I with the noise density equals to 0.2.|$|R
30|$|Resistant to salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise: The {{images in}} the AR {{database}} are also injected with salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise to test the performance of different methods. Salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise is composed by two noise components: salt noise <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. Salt noise is the bright spot <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise is the darker spot, which generally appear in the image at the same time. The third row in Fig.  4 shows some samples injected with salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise with different noise density d[*]=[*] 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.25. Table  5 lists the average recognition rates of different methods for face recognition under salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. From the table, we can see that, compared with the Gaussian noise and the uniform noise, the recognition rates of the FLBP and NRLBPs drops much sharply when the images are injected with the salt <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. Especially, when the noise level is higher than d[*]=[*] 0.15, the recognition rates of the FLBP and NRLBPs are even lover than 40 %. However, it is observed from Table  5 that our proposed method can still give some significant recognition results even when the face images are seriously polluted by this kind of noise.|$|R

25|$|Clarkson visited The Lively, an African trading ship.

He bought samples from the ship and started a collection to which he added over the years. It included crops, spices and raw materials, along with refined trade goods.|$|E

25|$|After Giancana's {{return to}} the U.S., the police {{detailed}} officers to guard his house in Oak Park, Illinois. However, {{on the night of}} June 19, 1975, someone recalled the police detail. A gunman later entered Giancana's basement kitchen and shot him {{in the back of the}} head as he was frying sausage <b>and</b> <b>peppers.</b> After Giancana fell to the ground, the gunman turned him over and shot him six more times in the face and neck. Investigators suspected the murderer was a close friend whom Giancana had let into the house. One reason for this suspicion was that Giancana, due to his heart problems, could not eat spicy foods. Therefore, he might have been cooking for a friend. Giancana was killed shortly before he was scheduled to appear before the Church Committee investigating CIA and Cosa Nostra collusion in plots to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
