[...] Thaddeus Bowman, the last scout that Parker had sent out, rode up at a gallop and told him that they were not only coming, but coming in force and they were close. [...] Captain Parker was clearly aware that he was outmatched in the {{confrontation}} and was not prepared to sacrifice his men for no purpose. [...] He knew that {{most of the}} colonists' powder and military supplies at Concord had already been hidden. [...] No war had been declared.

Reich wrote about the affair in 1920 in his first published paper, [...] "Über einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke" [...] ("About a Case of Breaching the Incest Taboo"), presented in the third person as though about a patient.

He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him, on pain of threatening to tell his father. In the end, he did tell his father, and after a protracted period of beatings, his mother committed suicide in 1910, for which Reich blamed himself.|$|E

500|$|... {{published}} in 2011, expands {{on the original}} story with a short episode told from Gin's perspective. When Hotaru is a teenager, she shares some pudding with Gin before she leaves {{at the end of}} the summer. After Hotaru leaves, the yōkai attempt to cheer Gin up by bringing him a couple of persimmons, one of the most prized treats on the mountain. Impressed with the taste, Gin thinks of sharing one of these persimmons with Hotaru next year. After discussing ways to preserve the persimmon with the yōkai and a spirit named Matsumino, Gin sets off to find ice on the highest mountain peak, but is disappointed to find none during the summer. When Gin returns scratched up from his fruitless search for ice, Matsumino feels sorry for him and offers to deliver the persimmon to Hotaru for him. However, not knowing where she lives, Matsumino gets lost and grows hungry. After he returns from his unsuccessful attempt to find Hotaru, Matsumino apologizes to Gin for eating the persimmon and Gin forgives him. The story concludes with Gin seeing Hotaru the following summer <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> he will be able to tell her about his feelings for her.|$|E

2500|$|According to Thomas Merton, Saint Lutgarde (d.1246), a Cistercian mystic of Aywieres, Belgium, {{was one of}} {{the great}} {{precursors}} of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A contemporary of St. Francis, she [...] "... entered upon the mystical life with a vision of the pierced Heart of the Saviour, and had concluded her mystical espousals with the Incarnate Word by an exchange of hearts with Him." [...] Sources say that Christ came in a visitation to Lutgarde, offering her whatever gift of grace she should desire; she asked for a better grasp of Latin, that she might better understand the word of God and sing God's praise. Christ granted her request and Lutgarde’s mind was flooded with the riches of psalms, antiphons, readings, and responsories. However, a painful emptiness persisted. She returned to Christ, asking to return his gift, <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> she might, just possibly, exchange it for another. “And for what would you exchange it?” Christ asked. “Lord, said Lutgarde, I would exchange it for your Heart.” Christ then reached into Lutgarde and, removing her heart, replaced it with his own, at the same time hiding her heart within his breast.|$|E
