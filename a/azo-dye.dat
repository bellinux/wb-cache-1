40|$|We study both {{theoretically}} and experimentally anchoring {{properties of}} photoaligning <b>azo-dye</b> films {{in contact with}} a nematic liquid crystal depending on photoinduced ordering of <b>azo-dye</b> molecules. In the mean field approximation, {{we found that the}} bare surface anchoring energy linearly depends on the <b>azo-dye</b> order parameter and the azimuthal anchoring strength decays to zero in the limit of vanishing photoinduced ordering. From the absorption dichroism spectra measured in the <b>azo-dye</b> films that are prepared from the <b>azo-dye</b> derivative with polymerizable terminal groups (SDA- 2) we obtain dependence of the dichroic ratio on the irradiation dose. We also measure the polar and azimuthal anchoring strengths in nematic liquid crystal (NLC) cells aligned by the <b>azo-dye</b> films and derive the anchoring strengths as functions of the dichroic ratio. Though linear fitting of the experimental data for both anchoring strengths gives reasonably well results, it, in contradiction with the theory, predicts vanishing of the azimuthal anchoring strength at certain nonzero value of the <b>azo-dye</b> order parameter. By using a simple phenomenological model we show that this discrepancy {{can be attributed to the}} difference between the surface and bulk order parameters in the films.

In order to illustrate the dual effects (i. e. favorable or adverse) of saline water on the photofading of reactive <b>azo-dyes,</b> the degradation mechanism and reaction kinetics of dye photodecoloration in the presence of various NaCl concentrations were investigated in simulated experiments. Experimental results indicated that the photodecoloration of dye solution was mainly attributed to the hydroxyl radical. Due to the quenching of the hydroxyl radical by the chloride ion, the dye photodecoloration rate decreased with low NaCl concentration ( 50 g/L) was beneficial to produce reactive chlorine species, resulting in a significant increase of the photodecoloration rate. Moreover, reaction kinetic analysis demonstrated that the observed first-order rate constant for the photodeco-loration of dye solution consistently increased with the increasing NaCl concentration...|$|R

The extraction constants (K(ex)) for the ion association complexes of CuX(2) (-) and X(-) with these three <b>azo-dye</b> cations between an aqueous phase and several organic phases (chloroform, chlorobenzene, benzene and toluene) were determined.

40|$|<b>Azo-dyes,</b> {{molecules}} characterised by {{the presence}} of the azo-group (-N. N-), are widely used in textile, leather, rubber, plastic, and food industries. Water-soluble <b>azo-dyes</b> are greatly resistant to biodegradation, and are characterised by a high thermal and photo stability due to their complex structures. The release of these molecules into the environment is of crucial concern due to their toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic characteristics. Biosorption has been demonstrated an effective method to remove pollutants from wastewaters thus solving ecological tasks, being a low cost process and the sorbent biodegradable. The main requirements of an efficient sorbent are thermal, chemical and mechanical stability, and rapid sorption. In this work, the ability of both row cork and the same sorbent entrapped in a biopolymeric gel of calcium alginate, on the removal of chrysoidine from aqueous solutions was examined. The influence on the sorption of pH, initial dye concentration, and particle size, as well as the efficiency of the entrapment, have been investigated. The maximum sorption was found for cork samples of fine particle size (FC), in both row and entrapped forms, at pH 7; conversely, at pH 4 the difference is significant (0. 12. mmol/g for row cork and 0. 20. mmol/g for entrapped cork), evoking a cooperation of alginate in binding the positively charged chrysoidine molecule...|$|R

Furthermore, by using a two-step exposure process, the composite layer shows much better stability than that with a pure <b>azo-dye</b> material.

40|$|Hyperactive is {{one part}} of the attention-deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Several factors as diet, especially artificial food colours, are assumed to contribute to hyperactive behaviour in children since the early 70 ´s and are still being discussed. Artificial food colours are used to create the bright colours in sweets, lemonade and ice cream as well as cosmetics and drugs. Their effects on human health are verified by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – nevertheless artificial food colours, especially <b>Azo-dyes</b> are under suspicion to promote hyperactive behaviour. The following report focuses particular on children as the target group. The aim of this HTA is to find evidence whether there is a correlation between <b>Azo-dyes</b> and hyperactivity in children. The search included 4 Databases. Using inclusion criteria, two systematic reviews and eleven controlled trials could be identified, respectively. The majority of the studies suggested a correlation between artificial food colours and increased hyperactivity in children. However, the design and methods varied extremely between studies, which complicates the comparison and drawn conclusions. The hypothesis of a correlation can neither be affirmed nor be abolished.
