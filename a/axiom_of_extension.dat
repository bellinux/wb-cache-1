40|$|We have {{implemented}} the approach for hierarchical reasoning described in [1] {{as well as}} the extensions to reasoning in chains <b>of</b> theory <b>extensions</b> [2, 3]. Our tool (LoRe) allows us to reduce satisfiability problems in an extended theory to a base theory for which we can then use existing solvers. It takes as input the <b>axioms</b> <b>of</b> the theory <b>extension,</b> the ground goal and the list <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> function symbols. Chains <b>of</b> <b>extensions</b> are handled by having a list <b>of</b> <b>axiom</b> sets, and correspondingly a list <b>of</b> lists <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> function symbols. – The input is analyzed for ground terms with extension functions at the root. – After instantiating the axioms w. r. t. these terms, the extension symbols are hierarchically removed. – The resulting formula is either given to a prover for a base theory, or taken as goal for another reduction (if we have a chain <b>of</b> <b>extensions).</b> The program has two modes of execution.

40|$|A {{variant of}} the h-index {{introduced}} in García-Pérez (2009), called the iterated h-index, is studied to evaluate the productivity of scholars. It consists of successive applications of the h-index so as to obtain a vector of h-indices. In particular, the iterated h-index fixes a drawback of the h-index since it allows for (lexicographic) comparisons of scholars with the same h-index. Two types or results are presented. Firstly, we provide an axiomatic characterization of the iterated h-index, which rests on a new <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> consistency and <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>axioms</b> in the literature to a richer framework. Secondly, we apply the h-index and iterated h-index to offer alternative sport rankings in tennis, football and basketball.

The end product is a general corecursor that allows corecursive (and even recursive) calls under "friendly" operations, including constructors. Friendly corecursive functions can be registered as such, thereby increasing the corecursor's expressiveness.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general method for {{overwriting}} theories with model conservative extensions in mechanized mathematics systems. Model conservative extensions, {{which include the}} denition of new constants {{and the introduction of}} new abstract datatypes, are " because they preserve models as well as consistency. The method employs the notions of theory interpretation and theory instantiation. It is illustrated using many-sorted rst-order logic, but it works for a variety of underlying logics. Supported by the MITRE-Sponsored Research program. 1 1 Introduction Mathematical reasoning is always performed in some mathematical context consisting of vocabulary and assumptions. The formal counterpart of a context is a theory consisting of a formal language plus a set of sentences of the language called axioms.

40|$|Induction is {{typically}} formalized {{as a rule}} or <b>axiom</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the LK-calculus. While this <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the sequent calculus is simple and elegant, proof transformation and analysis can be quite difficult. Most alternative sequent calculus formalizations of induction do not extend Herbrand's theorem and are thus not fully adequate for proof analysis. In this work we extend the existing formalism of proof schemata, a recursive formulation of induction particularly suited for proof analysis, and show equivalence between PA and a fragment of our extended formalism. This relationship provides a conservative reflection principle between PA and an alternative proof formalism. A schematic approach need {{not be limited to}} arithmetic and should be investigated further. Comment: This is a preprint of an article we plan to submit to LICS 2018. Expect further editing though the essentials will remain unchange...|$|R

40|$|Many {{optimization}} {{problems can}} be naturally represented as (hyper) graphs, where vertices correspond to variables and edges to tasks, whose cost depends on {{the values of the}} adjacent variables. Capitalizing on the structure of the graph, suitable dynamic programming strategies can select certain orders of evaluation of the variables which guarantee to reach both an optimal solution and a minimal size of the tables computed in the optimization process. In this paper we introduce a simple algebraic specification with parallel composition and restriction whose terms up to structural axioms are the graphs mentioned above. In addition, free (unrestricted) vertices are labelled with variables, and the specification includes operations of name permutation with finite support. We show a correspondence between the well-known tree decompositions of graphs and our terms. If an <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> scope <b>extension</b> is dropped, several (hierarchical) terms actually correspond to the same graph. A suitable graphical structure can be found, corresponding to every hierarchical term. Evaluating such a graphical structure in some target algebra yields a dynamic programming strategy. If the target algebra satisfies the scope extension axiom, then the result does not depend on the particular structure, but only on the original graph. We apply our approach to the parking optimization problem developed in the ASCENS e-mobility case study, in collaboration with Volkswagen. Dynamic programming evaluations are particularly interesting for autonomic systems, where actual behavior often consists of propagating local knowledge to obtain global knowledge and getting it back for local decisions.
