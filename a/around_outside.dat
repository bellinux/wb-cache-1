5|$|The game {{opens in}} Paris, {{a day before}} the {{original}} game's start, with journalist Nicole Collard receiving a request {{to go to the}} Palais Royale, to interview a famous media tycoon and potential candidate for President of France, Pierre Carchon. A mime hangs <b>around</b> <b>outside</b> Carchon's home, but Nico ignores him and goes on inside the house. She meets Carchon's wife, Imelda, as well as Carchon, who reveals that he knew Nico's father, Thierry Collard, very well. Soon, there is a noise in the drawing room; Carchon investigates only to be shot. Nico rushes to the scene to see the mime over Pierre's corpse. She is knocked to the ground before she can do anything and wakes up to find Imelda going to call the police.|$|E

25|$|He {{was offered}} a {{professional}} contract with Swansea Town {{at the age of}} seventeen, and he immediately settled into the Second Division side. His debut came at Bramall Lane on 20 December 1952, in {{what turned out to be}} a 7–1 defeat to Sheffield United. However his progress was halted when he twisted his knee on National Service, though this injury came as he was messing <b>around</b> <b>outside</b> the cook house rather than on parade or in the 9th Battalion's march to the Army Cup. He went straight back into the first team upon his recovery, and he was played mostly at centre-half, or in his preferred position at right-half. He remained in the first eleven under Ron Burgess, who was appointed manager following McCandless' death in July 1955.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} winter, preparations {{were made for}} the summer sledging. Because the conditions—constant, strong winds and an excessive slope by the hut—prevented Mertz from conducting skiing lessons as regularly as intended, he focussed instead on helping Ninnis {{to care for the}} dogs. On days when the weather was good they drove the dogs <b>around</b> <b>outside</b> the hut, teaching them to run in teams; when the winds returned the pair fitted and sewed harnesses for each dog, and prepared their sledging food. By this time Mertz and Ninnis developed a close friendship, as the expedition's taxidermist Charles Laseron later wrote: ...|$|E

While going to Springfield University, she is tracked by Milhouse, Martin, and Database when Milhouse saw Lisa ride away. At a lecture about Itchy & Scratchy cartoons, Milhouse blows Lisa's cover and she is no longer welcome by her college friends.|$|E
500|$|MCA {{gave the}} band its first {{professional}} recording budget, and Blink-182 {{began work on}} Enema of the State in October 1998. The trio {{had not been in}} a studio in two years and were anxious to record new material. Blink-182 returned to DML Studios to write new songs, where the band had previously spent time writing songs for their second record, Dude Ranch. The three spent much more time in the studio than on previous records, allowing them to try many different things. Barker would drive down each day from Riverside {{to take part in the}} writing process. Very satisfied with the results, the band completed writing in two weeks. Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member. Don Lithgow, owner and operator of DML Studios, recalled that the trio's celebrity had increased considerably during the recording process: [...] " [...] was different than their other sessions— girls hanging <b>around</b> <b>outside,</b> calling their friends on cell phones. All the kids wanted autographs.... They'd unlock the doors and let kids into the studio, which most bands would never do." [...] Due to the success of Dude Ranch, the label and band management had high expectations.|$|E

500|$|Studies on freely moving {{rats and}} mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action {{potentials}} when the animal passes through a particular location. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair. [...] However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather that to its actual location in the room. Over many years, many studies {{have been carried out}} on place-responses in rodents, that have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate which are much weaker. [...] There is little if any spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next {{to each other in the}} hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving <b>around</b> <b>outside</b> the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz, when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat's location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also on the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables.|$|E

2500|$|Joshua Slocum was {{the first}} single-handed yachtsman to {{successfully}} pass this way (in 1895) although in the end, extreme weather forced him {{to use some of}} the inshore routes between the channels and islands and it is believed he did not actually pass outside the Horn proper. If one had to go by strict definitions, the first small boat to sail <b>around</b> <b>outside</b> Cape Horn was the [...] yacht Saoirse, sailed by Conor O'Brien with three friends, who rounded it during a circumnavigation of the world between 1923 and 1925. In 1934, the Norwegian Al Hansen {{was the first}} to round Cape Horn single-handed from east to west — the [...] "wrong way" [...] — in his boat Mary Jane, but was subsequently wrecked on the coast of Chile. The first person to successfully circumnavigate the world single-handed via Cape Horn was Argentinian Vito Dumas, who made the voyage in 1942 in his [...] ketch Lehg II; a number of other sailors have since followed him, including Webb Chiles aboard [...] "" [...] who in December 1975 rounded Cape Horn single-handed. On March 31, 2010, 16-year-old Abby Sunderland became the youngest person to single-handedly sail around Cape-Horn in her attempt to circumnavigate the globe. In 1987 The British Cape Horn Expedition, headed by Nigel H Seymour, rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing kayaks' called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails mountable in any four of the sailing positions between the two kayaks.|$|E
