40|$|This thesis aims to {{describe}} and explain the relatively new, but widespread phenomenon of amateur subtitling of scripted television series, and to propose a model {{that can be used}} to analyze this specific kind of translational practice in its social and technological context. For this purpose, we have adopted theoretical and methodological approaches from the disciplines of translatology, sociology and media studies, while highlighting the changing functions of audiovisual translation in contemporary society and the role of translational norms. Motivation for translating is explained using Bourdieu's concepts of cultural and social capital. In the empirical part, we apply the analytical model to a case study, which focuses on the on Czech amateur subtitling of the first season of the Game of Thrones television drama series. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we describe and analyze the social context, the process of the translation itself, and the reception and resulting structural features of amateur subtitles compared to the official subtitles aired by HBO. A key informant interview with the <b>amateur</b> <b>translator</b> is used to shed light on the motivations behind and the logistics of his work.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how Italian and Spanish fansubbers cope with the translation of intertextuality in order to exploit others’ experience in translation teaching practice. Examples of solutions employed by <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> were provided from the serial 'Supernatural', where visual and verbal references to US culture are largely employed. Studying a small corpus of solutions, especially the wrong ones – i. e. those not conveying both reference and function of quotes – we understood that the inadequate level of encyclopaedic knowledge mastered by the young <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> may be the cause of erroneous translations. In fact, the procedures they employ to solve intertextual challenges show that most of the fansubbers are not able to recognise the reference behind the quotations, or if they do it, hardly can they recover the proper source or its codified translation into the target culture. As a result, sometimes textual coherence is affected, leading spectators to a general incomprehension of the use of intertextuality...|$|R

40|$|Throughout this dissertation, {{which is}} based on the movie “Quijotes Negros”, the {{importance}} of the application of linguistic knowledge in the process of script translation will be analyzed. The problems one encounters when translating the script of a film that includes an interesting use of language, that is, a mixture of dialectal characteristics and standard Spanish, go beyond the literal conveyance of the message and comprise a deeper knowledge of cultural features of both languages, in order to truly give tribute to the original script, a part of the translation process which <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> tend to overlook. The dissertation will include theoretical and practical work. The study will comprise two chapters. The first one will be divided as follows: First, we will talk about linguistic theory including fields such as morphosyntax, semantics and pragmatics. Then, we will present the different points of view of various authors and translators regarding translation and its importance in the film industry. In order to be more specific and accurate, we will subdivide this section of the chapter in two parts. The first part will include the theory of translation on its own, discussing the different types of translation; translation in the film industry (including its evolution and the appearance of <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> along with the development of this industry), and translation techniques whereas the second part will include transference of culture through translation. The second chapter will focus on the analysis of the script of the film. First, we will talk about the contents discussed in the movie and give a short explanation, provided by the film director, of some events in Ecuadorian history as they are discussed in the film. Then, we will describe the specific linguistic and technical topics related to the problems found in the script; and finally, we will use all the theory previously discussed and apply it to present a new translation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on {{collaborative}} translation {{as a reflection of}} the contexts in which it takes place. I consider a wide range of contexts, including both historical and present day social change movements. Drawing on the principles that were outlined by scholars during the cultural turn in translation studies that took place during the 1980 s and 90 s, I examine cultural translation as something that can take place on many levels, from the translation of words and sentences to the translation of the values of a movement. As an example of the holistic approaches that are part of cultural translation, I look in-depth at Our Bodies, Ourselves, a feminist book that has been written and translated collaboratively by women all over the world. I then expand my survey of collaborative approaches to include the translation of literary and religious texts, including the translation of Don Quixote into Kichwa, as part of an indigenous movement, as well as historical and present day team translations of Buddhist sutras in the U. S. and China, and numerous collaborative Bible translations spanning centuries and continents. I also explore the relationship between <b>amateur</b> <b>translators,</b> collaborative approaches, and activism in social movements. Part of my aim is to bridge the gaps between translator training and translation theory, practice, and policy. In some cases, <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> are a manifestation of the values of a movement; in other cases they are a necessity due to limited financial resources, and activists take a variety of approaches to the problem of budgetary constraints. One approach is collaboration, which can make a translation project economically viable by dividing work amongst volunteers. Another solution is to form worker cooperatives. In addition, the use of technology can help to increase efficiency and save money. Translators in social change movements frequently solve problems and carry out their values by taking holistic approaches. From integrating modern technology and time-tested historical practices to drawing on translation traditions from a variety of cultures, collaborative translation projects demonstrate a wide range of ways in which the values of social change movements can be reflected in the translation process...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} {{the current status of}} translators practising in Malaysia and their {{perceptions}} towards the profession. The study was motivated by the dearth of literature on the status of the translator’s profession in Malaysia. Past studies have shown that translation is not considered a full-fledged profession in many other countries. Translators also do not perceive their own job as belonging to a profession due to a number of reasons. This study which adopts hermeneutic phenomenology as its method of inquiry is mostly qualitative in nature with an inclusion of some basic quantitative measures. The findings of this study has revealed that though Malaysian translators regard themselves as professionals in society, clients and the public unfortunately do not share the same views. The translators also cited unfair competition from <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> and unprofessional practices in their profession {{due to a lack of}} code of ethics, as challenges which seriously undermine the status of their professions. The findings of this study markedly highlight the concerted effort that is needed to set up a professional body to represent the translators in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|Japanese manga is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular form of literature for American readers, particularly young adults. For manga {{that has not been}} translated by companies, published, and sold in local bookstores, enthusiastic readers turn to online manga reading sites such as Manga Fox and Manga Reader. However, this system relies heavily on <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> who are typically pressured to produce chapters quickly for impatient readers. In many cases they are unable to proofread their work, and it becomes filled with many mistranslations of Japanese text. The analysis of the first volume of a Shonen Jump magazine manga, Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro by Yuusei Matsui, proves beneficial in illustrating the degree of difference between original Japanese text and English translation which can occur at the unprofessional level. The story follows the main protagonist, Yako Katsuragi, in her mystery solving adventures with underworld demon Neuro Nougami. I have reviewed each chapter of both the original Japanese text and the uploaded English translations from the website Manga Fox from the first volume, which is seven chapters, and have compiled a list of notable differences between the two versions from each chapter. The work of this project was to revise the incorrect translations in the English version of the manga. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to generate a}} model for official letter translation from English to Indonesian and vice versa. This study is a multiyear research planned to be conducted for two years. Research {{in the first year}} focuses on exploring the patterns of English and Indonesian official letters and studying the quality of the translation produced by <b>amateur</b> <b>translators.</b> The patterns of official letter and the information about the translation quality will then be used as the foundation for generating the prototype of model for official letter translation. The data analyzed in this research consist of official letters in English and bahasa Indonesia and their translation and statements {{about the quality of the}} translation. The analysis was done in several stages. First, analyzing the characteristics of official letters in English and official letters in bahasa Indonesia. Second, analyzing the quality of the translation of the letters by referring to the statements of the informants. Next, constructing the prototype of model for translating official letter from English into bahasa Indonesia and vice versa. Offical letters written in English and those written in bahasa Indonesia have both similarities and differences. There are only minor problems of the translation of the official letters in terms of message transfer but there are some problems dealing with the naturalness of the translation. In translating official letter, a translator needs to understand the characteristics of official letter in both SL and TL and use the proper techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{case of the}} {{translations}} of Lithuanian poetess Judita Vaičiūnaitė (1937 – 2001) early poetry into Russian clearly illustrates the damages an original literary text (and the author’s institution) bore seeking to gain a statewide readership. In this article the Soviet translational practice of the 1960 s is discussed as a phenomenon typical of Soviet literature when intentional rewriting, expurgation and ideological remakes of the authorial text {{were considered to be}} normal. The lowered horizons when translating the minor nationality’s original poetry, notable ideological inversions {{and the use of the}} source text in the most general scheme of the plot in Vaičiūnaitė’s early poetry translations into Russian, and even intimacy used in favour of ideological records marked not only the weakness and incompetence of <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> but also the pressure of the censoring institutions upon the author. The invisible chains of Soviet literary patronage demonstrated that the aesthetic value of the original and its translations for the publishing and propaganda industry of that time were of secondary importance. Wishing to spread their work to the wider circle of the Soviet readers and to strengthen the symbolic power, most often authors used to agree to the substitutions and editorial interventions into the authorial text. The interactions between the propagandist-educational character of the {{translations of}} that time and the artistic aims of the translational process in Soviet literary criticism were discussed later, after the revision of the Soviet heritage, evaluating the role of literature as a servant of the Soviet power machine. The fact that Vaičiūnaitė publicly never mentioned her early poetry translations into Russian reveals her attitude towards the prevalent translational practice: it was negatory as well as instrumental. Having agreed with the imprints of the Soviet literary patronage on the translations of her texts, she took the step gaining personal legitimisation in the state-wide Soviet literary universe...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{looks into}} the {{practice}} of song translation, which occupies a peripheral position in translation studies (TS) despite its commonplace occurrence and {{significant impact on the}} global spread of songs. Foreign songs enjoy enormous appeal in China, where different methods have been adopted to translate them with the aim of enhancing listeners’ full reception. In particular, the practice of writing Chinese lyrics anew and setting them to the foreign tunes regardless of the semantic relationship between the source text (ST) and the target text (TT) has proliferated over the past decades. Some translated songs capture the gist of the original lyrics omitting minor details whereas some sever their relations with the original. This blurs the boundaries between translation, adaptation and rewriting lyrics. Another noticeable phenomenon is the emergence of self-organising communities, whose involvement in translating song lyrics and circulating subtitled music videos (MVs) cannot be overlooked in today’s digital landscape. Song translation can be understood as a field with its own “rules of the game” and exchange of different forms of capital following a Bourdieusian perspective. Adopting a case study methodology, the thesis investigates the particular field of song translation with special reference to the translation practices of a veteran song translator named Xue Fan 薛范, online <b>amateur</b> <b>translators,</b> and a professional lyricist from Hong Kong called Albert Leung 林夕. These case studies have been conducted for providing an in-depth analysis of China’s song translation activities through time and the dynamics of the power relations in the field. To translate a song from one language and culture into another invariably involves the losses and gains of certain elements, given the song’s semiotic richness. Against this backdrop, the thesis attempts to examine how the interplay of different meaning-making modes in a song has been dealt with by different agents under various circumstances through close examination of the relationship between STs and TTs. This will allow {{a better understanding of the}} production, circulation and reception of song translations in respective historical, ideological and social contexts. It is hoped that the thesis can provide new insights into our understanding of ‘translation’ in relation to music, and further shed light on how translation evolves at the convergence of music and technology in the globalisation era...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} phenomenon of cultural translation {{in the context of}} an underground network of Internet-based <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> in China. Informal volunteer subtitle groups emerged in the late- 1990 s and began catering to the younger generation's thirst for U. S. media popular culture. This study documents the translation of U. S. TV programs and movies by Chinese youth and young adults participating in subtitle groups, and examines how these translations are shaped by cultural and social conditions in contemporary China. Based on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Taipei, this dissertation examines how subtitlers' translating practices relate to the globalization of sociocultural ideologies, and how Chinese audiences respond to subtitlers' translations in online discussion forums. I explore how subtitlers and audiences co-construct the humor in U. S. television situation comedies. Their language of evaluation used to judge controversial Chinese subtitles reveals the different cultural identities that audience members present for positioning themselves as moral Chinese who are familiar with the cultural, social, and political dimensions of what constitutes a laughable element. I also examine why subtitlers add annotations that are not linguistically encoded in the original English dialogues. By creating annotations, subtitlers provide background knowledge that they believe will help audiences better understand U. S. TV programs and movies, reveal their feelings about the subtitled programs to audiences, and create a sense of involvement by sharing their opinions of U. S. media programs with a community of like-minded individuals. Moreover, I analyze how subtitlers moralize their unauthorized use of U. S. TV programs and movies based on the conviction that Chinese youth and young adults want more instant access to foreign media programs. Subtitlers turn volunteer cultural translation into a moral site, where Chinese versions of intellectual property are tested, contested, and affirmed. This study has implications for how the intersection of the ideologies of culture, translation, and media technology and the ways in which their changing relations to one another shape translating practices. Subtitle groups provide Chinese youth and young adults with a medium for articulating, acting on, and practicing their own unofficial cultural translation that they may otherwise have difficulty carrying out...|$|R

40|$|The {{translation}} {{profession is}} {{regarded as one of}} the emerging professions in present times owing to its increasingly important role in disseminating information between various nations and cultures of the world. Nevertheless, translators face numerous obstacles in their quest to be recognized as full-fledged professionals. This study endeavors to provide a comparative description of the current status of the translation profession in Malaysia and Korea and to highlight the issues and challenges affecting the profession in both these countries. Past research has shown that translators from both developed and developing countries face many challenges in their practice. Amongst the problems which translators face are low pay, inconsistency in the code of conduct adhered to and the absence of quality control standards. Most translators’ associations in countries around the world do not have authority over their members and do not regulate their practice. Past studies also reveal that many societies do not regard translators as true professionals in their country. This study intends to ascertain if these issues are also real concerns in Malaysia and Korea. This research adopts an empirical, qualitative-oriented approach known as hermeneutic phenomenology. This approach seeks to describe, interpret and explain the phenomenon studied. In this study, the current status of translation profession in Malaysia and Korea is the phenomena which will be described, and the researcher would seek to interpret and explain the phenomena presented. Three research instruments that is, a survey questionnaire, interviews and document review were used to collect the data. Results from both countries were compared to highlight similarities and differences in a number of core aspects of the translation profession. This research has revealed that the Korean respondents possess higher academic qualifications but experience less self-satisfaction in the translation profession compared to their Malaysian counterparts. However, respondents from both countries similarly express indifference towards engaging in continuing professional development (CPD) activities and in using an external quality standard. Although the Malaysian and Korean translators regard themselves as professionals in society, clients who seek out translators and the public in general have very little awareness about the role and work of a translator. The translators also cited challenges such as unfair competition from <b>amateur</b> <b>translators</b> and unprofessional practices in their profession. These challenges are linked to the translators’ associations in both countries not wielding sufficient authority in regulating the practice of its members and protecting the rights of the trained translators. The comparison of the translation profession in Malaysia and Korea against Tseng’s Model of Professionalization Process revealed that in both countries, the profession is at the transition stage from the market disorder phase to the consolidation phase. A new model of the professionalization process for the translation profession has been proposed by the researcher based on the suggestions put forth by the respondents and the findings of this research. There is most importantly a need for translation associations to be endowed with the authority to regulate the practice of their members. With such authority translation can become an exclusive profession, where only those who have the qualification and competence in translating are admitted into a professional body and are allowed to practice. Nevertheless, it is also important for the translators to adhere to a code of practice, external quality standards and to engage in CPD activities in order to ensure the sustained competence of translators and subsequently, the elevation of the translation profession to a full professional status...|$|R
40|$|Translation Crowdsourcing ist ein wachsendes Phänomen in der Translationswissenschaft, das durch die fortschreitende Technologieentwicklung des Web 2. 0 entstanden ist. In der vorliegenden Masterarbeit wird das Thema Translation Crowdsourcing behandelt und insbesondere auf dessen Vorkommen im Non-Profit-Bereich eingegangen. Zunächst werden dabei wichtige Faktoren wie Entwicklung, erforderliche Rahmenbedingungen, Auftraggeber (FPO und NPO) und Auftragnehmer (Laienübersetzer und professionelle Übersetzer), Anreize sowie Chancen und Risiken des Translation Crowdsourcing für Übersetzer erörtert. Da die Übersetzungsqualität bei Anwendung des Translation Crowdsourcing oft in Zweifel gezogen wird, werden weiterhin Aspekte des Qualitätsmanagements beleuchtet sowie Best-Practices zum Qualitätsmanagement im Translation Crowdsourcing aufgezeigt. Im empirischen Teil wird das Translation Crowdsourcing am Beispiel von drei Non-Profit-Organisationen analysiert. Zu diesem Zwecke wird die Norm EN 15038 herangezogen und anhand der Desktop-Research-Methode die Übersetzungsprozesse der Organisationen Translators Without Borders, Kiva und The Rosetta Foundation untersucht und miteinander verglichen. Dabei wird insbesondere ermittelt, ob die Norm als Richtlinie für einen Translation-Crowdsourcing-Prozess herangezogen werden kann. Die Ziele dieser Masterarbeit sind die Darstellung der theoretischen Grundlagen des Translation Crowdsourcing, die Herausarbeitung der wachsenden Bedeutung dieser Arbeitsform und insbesondere die Erläuterung von Translation-Crowdsourcing-Prozessen im Non-Profit-Bereich sowie die Eignung der Norm EN 15038 als Richtlinie für Übersetzer. Die Masterarbeit soll dazu beitragen, die Übersetzungsqualität und die Prozesse des Translation Crowdsourcing weiter zu verbessern und deren zukünftige Anwendung zu erleichtern. Crowdsourcing is {{a result}} of the {{advancing}} technological development of the Web 2. 0 and has become an emerging phenomenon in Translation Studies. This master’s thesis addresses the topic of Translation Crowdsourcing and focuses especially on its usage in the non-profit sector. The first part discusses aspects like development, necessary frame conditions, customers (FPO and NPO), providers (<b>amateur</b> and professional <b>translator),</b> incentives as well as opportunities and risks of Translation Crowdsourcing affecting translators. Due to the fact that the quality of crowdsourced translations is often questioned, aspects of quality management as well as best practices for quality management in translation crowdsourcing are also presented. In the empirical part of this thesis three non-profit organizations which use translation crowdsourcing are analysed. By means of the desktop research method and by using the Eu-ropean Standard EN 15038 as a reference the translation processes of the organizations Translators Without Borders, Kiva and The Rosetta Foundation are examined and compared. In particular it is determined whether the European Standard may be used as a directive for translation crowdsourcing processes. The aims of this master’s thesis are to describe the theoretical bases of translation crowdsourcing, to determine the growing importance of this new method and particularly to explain translation crowdsourcing processes in the non-profit sector as well as to determine the European Standard EN 15038 as a directive for crowdsourcing translations. This master’s thesis is intended to contribute to the improvement of translation crowdsourcing quality and its processes and to facilitate future applications of translation crowdsourcing. ...|$|R
