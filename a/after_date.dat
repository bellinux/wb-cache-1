60|$|If these {{accounts}} by Mrs. Myers, Mrs. Woodward, Scarrat, Wintlebury, {{and others are}} trustworthy, then Elizabeth Canning's narrative is true, for she found the two girls, the tall, swarthy woman, the hay, and the broken water-pitcher, and almost everything else that she had mentioned on January 29, at Mother Wells's house when it was visited on February 1.

60|$|But {{here the}} case takes a new turn. Documents appear, letters from and to Dudley {{at the time}} of the event, which are totally {{inconsistent}} with guilt on his part. These documents (in the Pepys MSS. at Cambridge) are COPIES of letters between Dudley and Thomas Blount, a gentleman of good family, whom he addresses as 'Cousin.' Blount, long after, in May 1567, was examined on the affair before the Privy Council, and Mr. Froude very plausibly suggests that Blount produced the copies in the course of the inquiry. But why COPIES? We can only say that the originals may also have been shown, and the copies made for the convenience of the members of the Council. It is really incredible that the letters were forged, <b>after</b> <b>date,</b> to prove Dudley's innocence.|$|E

60|$|Here {{the reader}} with true common sense remarks that this second ghost, Lord Lyttelton's own, {{does not appear in}} {{evidence}} till 1828, fifty years <b>after</b> <b>date,</b> and then in an anonymous book, on no authority. We have permitted to the reader this opportunity of exercising his acuteness, while laying a little trap for him. It is not in 1828 that Mr. Andrews's story first appears. We first find it in December 1779--that is, in the month following the alleged event. Mr. Andrews's experience, and the vision of Lord Lyttelton, are both printed in 'The Scots Magazine,' December 1779, p. 650. The account is headed 'A Dream,' and yet the author avers that Lord Lyttelton was wide awake! This illustrates beautifully the fact on which we insist, that 'dream' is eighteenth-century English for ghost, vision, hallucination, or what you will.|$|E
60|$|Not {{only did}} she add this postcript, but I think she must have come near suppressing the letter; for it came long <b>after</b> <b>date,</b> and was closely {{followed}} by the third. In the time betwixt them, Alan had arrived, and made another life to me with his merry conversation; I had been presented to his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that drank more than I could have thought possible and was not otherwise of interest; I had been entertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself, all with no great change upon my sorrow; and we two (by which I mean Alan and myself, {{and not at all}} the cousin) had discussed a good deal the nature of my relations with James More and his daughter. I was naturally diffident to give particulars; and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the nature of Alan's commentary upon those I gave.|$|E
6000|$|The next {{evidence}} is ten years <b>after</b> <b>date,</b> the statements taken down by Jack Wesley in 1726 (1720?). Mrs. Wesley adds to her former account that she [...] "earnestly desired {{it might not}} disturb her" [...] (at her devotions) [...] "between five and six in the evening," [...] {{and it did not}} rout in her room at that time. Emily added that a screen was knocked at on each side as she went round to the other. Sukey mentioned the noise as, on one occasion, coming gradually from the garret stairs, outside the nursery door, up to Hetty's bed, [...] "who trembled strongly in her sleep. It then removed to the room overhead, where it knocked my father's knock on the ground, as if it would beat the house down." [...] Nancy said that the noise used to follow her, or precede her, and once a bed, on which she sat playing cards, was lifted up under her several times to a considerable height. Robin, the servant, gave evidence that he was greatly plagued with all manner of noises and movements of objects.|$|E

6000|$|I am contemplating Will in the {{conditions}} {{on which the}} Baconians insist; if they will indeed let us assume that {{for a few years}} he was at a Latin school. I credit the graceless loon with the curiosity, the prompt acquisitiveness, the love of poetry and romance, which the author of the plays must have possessed in youth. [...] "Tradition says nothing of all that," [...] the Baconian answers, and he may now, if he likes, turn to my reply in The Traditional Shakespeare. {59a} Meanwhile, how can you expect old clerks and sextons, a century <b>after</b> <b>date,</b> in a place where literature was NOT of supreme interest, to retain a tradition that Will used to read sometimes (if he did), in circumstances of privacy? As far as I am able to judge, had I been a boy at Stratford school for four years, had been taught nothing but Latin, and had little or no access to English books of poetry and romance, I should have acquired about the same amount of Latin as I suppose Shakspere to have possessed. Yet I could scarcely, like him, have made the second syllable in [...] "Posthumus" [...] long! Sir Walter Scott, however, was guilty of similar false quantities: he and Shakspere were about equally scholarly.|$|E
6000|$|Fakarava {{was chosen}} to be the seat of Government from {{nautical}} considerations only. It is eccentrically situate; the productions, even for a low island, poor; the population neither many nor--for Low Islanders--industrious. But the lagoon has two good passages, one to leeward, one to windward, so that in all states of the wind it can be left and entered, and this advantage, for a government of scattered islands, was decisive. A pier of coral, landing-stairs, a harbour light upon a staff and pillar, and two spacious Government bungalows in a handsome fence, give to {{the northern end of}} Rotoava a great air of consequence. This is confirmed on the one hand by an empty prison, on the other by a gendarmerie pasted over with handbills in Tahitian, land-law notices from Papeete, and republican sentiments from Paris, signed (a little <b>after</b> <b>date)</b> [...] "Jules Grévy, Perihidente." [...] Quite at the far end a belfried Catholic chapel concludes the town; and between, on a smooth floor of white coral sand and under the breezy canopy of coco-palms, the houses of the natives stand irregularly scattered, now close on the lagoon {{for the sake of the}} breeze, now back under the palms for love of shadow.|$|E
60|$|All {{this may}} have been written as late as 1468, but a vague {{reference}} to an apparition of our Lord rather suggests contemporary hearsay, before Jeanne came to Orleans. Jeanne never claimed any such visions of our Lord. The story of the clairvoyance as to the Battle of the Herrings is also given in the 'Chronique de la Pucelle.'* M. Quicherat thinks that the passage is amplified from the 'Journal du Siege.' On the other hand, M. Vallet (de Viriville) attributes with assurance the 'Chronique de la Pucelle' to Cousinot de Montreuil, who was the Dauphin's secretary at Poictiers, when the Maid was examined there in April 1429.** If Cousinot was the author, he certainly did not write his chronicle till long <b>after</b> <b>date.</b> However, he avers that the story of clairvoyance was current in the spring of 1429. The dates exactly harmonise; that is to say, between the day of the battle, February 12th, and the setting forth of the Maid from Vaucouleurs, there is just time for the bad news from Rouvray to arrive, confirming her statement, and {{for a day or two}} of preparation. But perhaps, after the arrival of the bad news, Baudricourt may have sent Jeanne to the King in a kind of despair. Things could not be worse. If she could do no good, she could do no harm.|$|E
