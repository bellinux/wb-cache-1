5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritationâ€”though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety <b>and</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Administration</b> (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E

Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E
