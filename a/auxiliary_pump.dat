50|$|The Torrington Foreman, Torrington, Connecticut, 1949.UNITED COMMINITY SPIRIT: The East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department. Little or no ballyhoo has {{accompanied}} {{two years}} of outstanding accomplishment in a neighboring town through united community spirit. So {{this is the story}} of the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department. First a little history. East Litchfield was a busy town many years ago, and until railroad came to Litchfield. Then the East Litchfield Depot was closed and the town became completely rural. World War II, however, caused the picture to change. New homes were built — the population increased. In fact, it even occurred to the Litchfield Civilian Defense Council that a trailer pump housed in East Litchfield might be a mighty handy piece of equipment to augment the fire protection from Litchfield. East Litchfield Community leaders were naturally very much interested in this proposal and agreed to assume responsibility for the trailer pump to secure better protection for East Litchfield's families and property. As disappointing as it may have seemed at the time, the trailer pump never did materialize. However, something more valuable was gained, for awakened to a community need, united effort to secure fire protection resulted. In January, 1947, East Litchfield residents met with Martin Iffland and Edward J. Wilson to discuss ways and means of reaching the objective. The response was so enthusiastic that by spring, the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department was duly incorporated, officers elected and the company formally launched. The Litchfield Fire Chief, representatives of other volunteer fire companies and Attorney Thomas F. Wall were most helpful in the organizing process. The Fire Department's membership had reached a total of 60. The organization completed, the next objective was a treasury. No time was lost for the entire community to go to work to raise needed funds. Volunteers worked with a will many a Saturday at the back-breaking job of collecting tons of scrap steel and iron — some of it secured from points as far away as New Hartford. Dances and card parties were sponsored and one person became the proud owner of a new car as a result of fund raising efforts. Cooperation was the keynotes in all of these activities, as every member helped in two or three capacities. And — during this time, the other half of the neighborhood — the half that sits on the other side of the breakfast table — decided that it should pitch in too. So the Ladies auxiliary was formed in April. Bakery sales, rummage sales and a highly successful auction sponsored by the ladies — contributed materially to both the treasury and to the morale of the department. And so, in July 1947 the trailer pump, that never did materialize, finally resulted in a second-hand American LaFrance 750 gallon pumper rebuilt to carry a 200-gallon water supply and 2,000 feet of hose, ladders, hand pumps, nozzles, a gasoline <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pump</b> and other equipment. Mr. Wilson generously made one of his barns available for a temporary fire house. Meanwhile, the officers of the company received instructions in fire-fighting methods from Captain Rougeot of Torrington and first aid instruction from Harold Lacore. After the equipment was available, regular weekly drills were instituted so that other members of the department could receive training. As it turned out, the equipment and the instruction came none too soon. That fall, forest fires broke out near the Torrington dump and spread towards East Litchfield and Litchfield. For three chilly nights, the East Litchfield Volunteer Firemen worked until the early hours helping to check the fires over a broad front. Thousands of gallons of water were pumped over the hills and the woods saving much of the forest and presenting the flames from reaching several homes in their path. The East Litchfield Company had proved its value to the community and at the same time, partially repaid the neighboring fire departments for all the help they had given. “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” so the saying goes. And this could be true of a volunteer fire department. In fact, one of the purposes of the company, as stated in its constitution to promote the social activity of the community. To this end, public dances, card parties and an annual outing in August for the whole family and a ball in the fall is on the department's social calendar. Early in 1948 it was learned that the temporary firehouse would have to be vacated. So once again the volunteer workers sprang into action with a new firehouse as their goal. A parcel of land was donated by George Sawyer and plans for a two-story building, thirty by sixty feet was decided upon. Fund raising activities were stepped up with the gratifying result that construction was started late this summer. United community spirit was in action again. Virtually all of the labor is being contributed by the members in the hope that the saving would make it possible to complete the building sufficiently to house the truck before snowfall. The finishing of the interior and second floor will very likely have to wait until further funds are available. At that time it will make the hall upstairs large enough so that in the future it will be a source of income as well as a meeting place for the community. And so — through the united effort of the people of East Litchfield — in less than two years the community has acquired a trained fire company with adequate equipment, and will soon have a major public improvement without taxation. But of even more importance, every member of the community has gained through the lessons learned in cooperation and good fellowship. Hats off to the East Litchfield Volunteers, outstanding examples of United Community Spirit.|$|E

40|$|A novel recycle preparative HPLC {{system was}} {{developed}} to repeatedly enrich and purify low-abundance compounds from complex samples. The recycle separation involves injecting a large volume of the sample through a trap column, releasing the absorbed sample for preparative HPLC separation, and then capturing the target component in the same trap column for the next separation. After several cycles, the final purified target compound absorbed in the trap column is eluted with a small volume of solvent. The capture and recycle procedure was realized by adjusting {{the strength of the}} mobile phase using an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pump</b> and switching the two valves connecting the trap and preparative columns. Compared with standard HPLC or existing recycle chromatography, this system not only reduces the solvent side-effects and sample volume overloading during injection but also avoids peak-broadening and sensitivity loss during the recycle runs. Moreover, the final purified products can be easily concentrated.

Poor crop yields made it difficult for farmers to pay their portion of the district's costs, so Reclamation refused to fund needed improvements.

40|$|Abstract: A {{surprising}} hiatus affects fish {{research and}} management. Those of us working in fish passage strive to move fish past barriers. Aquaculturists, {{on the other}} hand, move fish around fish farms safely and effectively. Marrying these two approaches presents an exciting opportunity for fishway development. Millions of fish-passage barriers remain in rivers globally, together with many under-performing and costly fishway investments, resulting in declining biodiversity and production of freshwater fish. Better approaches to fishway design are urgently needed to aid in halting this worldwide loss of connectivity. Multidisciplinary work at UNSW Australia aims to refine and test a pump fishway. This novel concept integrates technologies from fish passage and aquaculture to improve fishway performance and reduce costs. Fishways knowledge is being combined with pumping techniques routinely used in aquaculture to safely transport large biomasses of fish from across a broad size range. The pump fishway uses a helical fishway section to provide sufficient elevation for fish to be gravitated into a transfer chamber, which is then pressurized with water piped from the reservoir. This flow carries fish up a rising transfer pipe and a small <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pump</b> finally delivers fish into the reservoir. A pump fishway offers many potential benefits: effective upstream passage for migrant fish communities; lightweight, modular construction with few moving parts; applicability to diverse sites and barriers 3 ̆e 1. 5 m high; energy-independence using hydraulic power from the reservoir to drive the system; continuous operation with brief transfer cycles; and potential barge-mounted use providing mobility, flood protection and fewer constraints due to tailwater levels. Large savings on capital and operating costs are predicted. Research and development are planned to optimise and validate the pump fishway design, using physical and computational hydraulic modelling and animal trials with wild, migrating fish...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{skeletal}} muscle ventricles {{to assist the}} failing heart is a potential solution to {{the problems associated with}} cardiac transplantation. In this approach, circulatory assistance would be provided by an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pump</b> (Skeletal muscle ventricle or SMV) formed from the patient's own back muscle and activated by an implanted controller. We do not yet have sufficient understanding of the function of SMVs to use them safely and effectively in humans, but the feasibility of the technique has been established - SMVs have worked for up to two years in dogs. Skeletal muscle itself is a highly complex linear motor. Its passive mechanical properties, the relationship between its neural input and its mechanical output and the dependence of its mechanical output on its loading conditions, are all non-linear. Together with the geometrical complexities of thick walled pumping chambers, these factors preclude analytical modelling of of SMVs from first principles. A new approach is needed to link these many interacting factors together. Developments in systems engineering and computer science in terms of local linear network models (LLNMs), and new methods of controller design based on LLMNs, have considerable potential for this application. LLMN methods have evolved recently from the general field of artificial neural networks. The ultimate goal of this project is to generate controllers for SMVs based on LLMNs. Such controllers would elicit pumping work from the assist device, with due regard to the history of activation of the muscle, and with the fewest possible neural impulses. The latter condition must be met {{in order to maintain the}} balance between the desirable increase in endurance and the undesirable reduction in speed and power that are both consequences of activation of {{skeletal muscle}} in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In {{this thesis}} a method is {{presented}} {{for maintaining the}} left ventricular wall stress {{of the human heart}} at a constant level during the systole (active portion of the heart's cycle). This constant stress level makes it possible to take isotonic measurements on the heart muscles. The left ventricle of the human heart is modeled on a hybrid computer. To accomplish this task certain assumptions as to the shape and muscle characteristics of the left ventricle are made; then the relations for stress and pressure are obtained. The simulating force for this active left ventricle is a curve, simulated by a Diode Function Generator, representing the muscle characteristics of the left ventricle as a function of time. This model substitutes for the portion of an active heart needed to design the control device. With this model of the left ventricle, a control device is developed, using an analog computer, which acts as a pump controlling the amount of fluid in the left ventricle during the systole. This pump extracts the fluid from the cavity when the stress rises above the desired level and reinjects the fluid into the cavity when the stress falls below this level. The control device consists of a piston and cylinder assembly with a preloaded spring behind the piston. An electromagnetic feedback control may be used to maintain the stress level. It is not essential, however, since this control system accomplishes the same purpose as a passive device by adjusting the system parameters. The parameter values are given in Chapter III of this thesis. This control device is applicable to any left ventricle within the range of 60 to 150 ml. Another possible future application of this control device is its use as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pump</b> to control the pressure in the left ventricle of a failing human heart. This device could be connected to the aorta. This use of the control device is theoretical and has not yet been tested...|$|E
