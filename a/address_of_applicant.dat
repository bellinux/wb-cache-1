50|$|There {{is a need}} {{to amend}} the RTI Act to provide for the {{protection}} of those seeking information under the Act. The Asian Centre for Human Rights recommends that a separate chapter, “Protection of those seeking information under the(RTI) Act”, be inserted into the Act. Protection measures should include (a)mandatory, immediate registration of complaints of threats or attacks against RTI activists on the First Information Report and placing such FIRs before the magistrate or judge of the area within 24 hours for issuance of directions for protection of those under threats and their family members, and periodic review of such protection measures; (b)conducting inquiry into threats or attacks by a police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police/Assistant Commissioner of Police, to be concluded within 90 days; and (c)trial of the accused within six months. Further, concerned Public Information Officers, First Appellate Authorities and those directly related with the information sought under the RTI Act should be presumed to have abetted the offenses against the RTI activists unless evidence proves otherwise. (d)We know,'Prevention is better than cure, we should make changes in the present RTI Act which should ensure the anonymity of the Applicant, this can be achieved by removing the compulsion of mentions of name and <b>address</b> <b>of</b> <b>applicant.</b> And the Information should be posted on the Official Website. Now, most of the Information which results in threat to the life of whistle blowers and activists have no security concern. For example, all the information related to MNREGA if made public, is not going to result in threat to privacy of nation or anyone, But we have seen murders of various RTI activist seeking Informations related to MNREGA.|$|E

40|$|Distance from an origin to a {{destination}} {{has long been}} considered {{a major factor in}} determining degrees of accessibility. For this reason, distance to Head Start sites for families in need of their services was examined. Semcac, the Head Start grantee for seven counties in southeastern Minnesota, provided the <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> Head Start <b>applicants</b> and participants from the past three years in Winona County. These addresses were geocoded for analysis. Distance to the nearest Head Start facility was determined using ESRI Network Analyst for the student origins. Distance for block group centroids and student origin means were determined using the near distance function in ESRI ArcToolbox. The summary statistics for these distance values were compared. A kernel density layer was created using the student origins point features and was used to determine the location of a hypothetical Head Start facility. The summary statistics describing distance were then compared for the two Head Start site and three site datasets to determine the validity of the hypothetical site location. Census data and the student origins were used to create a linear regression model that could predict variability in participant and applicant distribution. Block groups fitting this model were then examined...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{recruitment}} behaviour of firms at the extensive margin; we empirically explore the relationship between employer search strategies and the number <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> by means <b>of</b> (reduced form) two-equations simultaneous models. The empirical analysis is carried out on a rich micro data set on Dutch employer recruitment behaviour. Our empirical analysis reveals that the economic conditions prevailing on the labour market influence employer search activity at the extensive margin. In particular, we see that in tight (slack) labour markets characterised by excess demand (supply) of labour, the flow <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> is smaller (larger). Employers react to the shortage (excess) <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> by using more (less) often advertisements. This recruitment channel appears to trigger a significantly larger flow <b>of</b> <b>applicants.</b> recruitment · labour demand...|$|R

Methodology: A descriptive study based on the records <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> for dentistry programs in universities using the PSU test for their admissions from 2012 to 2014. Results: The analysis included 14 universities and 18 programs (campuses). Ten were private and 8 traditional.

40|$|Interviewers' {{questioning}} {{behavior and}} predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> ratings varies considerably in unstructured interviews. A model hypothesizing {{a relationship between}} these variables is tested in this study. The model proposes {{that the relationship between}} interviewer questioning behavior and evaluation validity is mediated by the diagnosticity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> information that is collected during the interview. The process and content of three interviewers' questioning of 149 candidates for an entry-level correctional officer position was examined. Although the complete information gathering model was not supported, a robust relationship between questioning behavior and information diagnosticity emerged. Furthermore, the validity <b>of</b> individual interviewers' <b>applicant</b> evaluations varied considerably. These results reinforce the existence of differences in interviewers' questioning behavior and differences in the quality <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> information they gather. Because differences in questioning behavior correspond to differences in the predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> ratings, both these variables should be monitored at the individual interviewer level...|$|R
