40|$|We {{developed}} twenty microsatellite markers for the Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark</b> (Chersophilus duponti), one of {{the most}} endangered European bird species, and tested in two related, more widely distributed species: crested lark (Galerida cristata) and thekla lark (Galerida theklae). 14 markers amplified and were polymorphic in Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark,</b> 11 in crested lark and 6 in thekla lark. Microsatellite var- iability analyses were carried out on Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark</b> (N = 23 – 28 individuals), crested lark (N = 9 – 10) and thekla lark (N = 14) populations in NE Spain showing moderate/high diversity, ranging from 1 to 13 alleles per locus. The mean allelic richness in Dupont’s lark was 6. 21 and expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 195 to 0. 848 and from 0. 071 to 0. 889, respectively. Crested and thekla larks showed moderate/high diversity with a mean allelic richness of 4. 36 and 4. 67, respectively. This microsatellite set could be useful for population genetic studies of lark species widely differing in popula- tion fragmentation and conservation status across the Old World. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Along {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of China and its eye-catching economic take-off, industrial production has brought about increasingly enormous negative impact. Industrial residues (coal ash, iron-ore slag, phosphorous slag and ganister sand) have accumulated in large quantities, thus severely contaminating the environment and greatly restricting the sustainable economic development. This paper conducts research on microstructure of the industrial wastes that are massively applied in domestic architectural material industry, such as coal <b>ash,</b> (<b>S</b> 95,S 105) slag powder, S 75 phosphorous slag, micro-bead (ultra-fine coal ash) and the micro ganister sand so as to analyze its size distribution and particle appearance and introduce its functions and effect in concrete and other cement products...|$|R

This species is able to survive at higher altitudes and therefore occupies a less competitive niche with fewer tree species able to tolerate the harsher conditions. The rock whitebeam interbred with the rowan / mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) to produce the hybrid, a fertile separate species the Scottish whitebeam (Sorbus arranesis) which grows well in this zone of reduced competitive growth at higher altitudes. The bastard mountain ash (Sorbus pseudofennica) arose from a further cross between S. arranensis and the mountain <b>ash</b> (<b>S.</b> aucuparia).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Three sodium waterglass (NWG) such as {{commercial}} NWG (S 1), NWG from pure rice husk <b>ash</b> (<b>S</b> 2) and NWG from raw rice husk <b>ash</b> (<b>S</b> 3) were applied for producing geopolymer cements using metakaolin (MK) as aluminosilicate source. Geopolymers (Geo 1, Geo 2 and Geo 3) were prepared using each NWG with the molar ratios SiO 2 /Na 2 O and H 2 O/Na 2 O kept constant at 1. 5 and 12, respectively. It could be {{observed that the}} water absorption of Geo 1, Geo 2 and Geo 3 is 7, 9 and 13. 2  % and the mass loss is 15. 8, 14. 7 and 12. 4  %, respectively. Their compressive strength at 20  days (37. 5 / 34. 3 / 29. 6  MPa) and 28  days (43. 3 / 40. 3 / 33. 2  MPa) increases with increasing the aging and decreases in the course Geo 1 /Geo 2 /Geo 3. Their average pore radius (6 / 8 / 20  nm) and cumulative pore volumes (155 / 205 / 245  mm 3 /g) increase in the course Geo 1 /Geo 2 /Geo 3. It is discussed {{that the presence of}} phosphate known as corrosion inhibitors in raw rice husk ash hinders the dissolution of SiO 2. It entails the formation of NaH 2 PO 4 in S 3 which reduces the soluble Si atoms. Therefore, less amount of metakaolin could be dissolved leaving thus a higher amount of unreacted metakaolin particles in Geo 3. The reacted volumes and compositions of the geopolymers are different in the three cases, too. A content of approximately 20, 25 and 35  % of unreacted metakaolin was proved for Geo 1, Geo 2 and Geo 3, respectively. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext. ...|$|R
