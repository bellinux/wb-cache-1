5|$|Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, {{mindful of}} the federal government's {{disallowance}} of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, reserved royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada. This was the first use {{of the power of}} reservation in Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina.
