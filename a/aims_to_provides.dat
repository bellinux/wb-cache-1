The value of the grade is the scheme’s estimate of the percentage score that a player would have achieved on average if partnering another player with the same current grade at Match Pointed Pairs {{in a field of}} nationally average strength. EBU grades have been divided into 13 playing card bands, ranging from ‘Ace’ at the top to ‘Two’ at the beginners’ end. Each band covers a 2% range of grade values, with ‘Eight’ having a range of 49‐51%. The scheme is complementary to the Master Point Scheme, and the two schemes are independent.|$|E

40|$|For {{most parents}} {{there is no}} imaginable event more devastating than {{the death of their}} child. Nevertheless, while {{bereaved}} parents grieve they are also expected to carry on with their life. The day-to-day activities that were once routine for these parents may now be challenging due to the emotional turmoil they are experiencing. To date parental bereavement has been described as complex, intense, individualized, and life-long and their grief responses are interwoven with their daily activities, but the nature of their daily life challenges are not known. This dissertation highlights the significance of how parents respond to their bereavement challenges because bereaved parents have higher morbidity and mortality rates than non-bereaved parents or adults who have lost their spouse or parents. Many bereaved parents in their daily routines include activities that allow them to maintain a relationship with their deceased child. These behaviors have been described as “continuing bonds”, but with this dissertation the continuing bonds concept is analyzed to provide a clear conceptual definition, which can be used for future research. Using the Adaptive Leadership Framework as the theoretical lens and a mixed method, multiple case study design, the primary study in this dissertation <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>provides</b> knowledge about the challenges parents face {{in the first six months}} following the death of their child, the work they use to meet these challenges, and the co-occurrence of the challenges, and work with their health status. Bereaved parents challenges are unique to their individual circumstances, complex, interrelated and adaptive, as they have no easy fix. Their challenges were pertaining to their everyday life without their child and classified as challenges related to: a) grief, b) continuing bonds, c) life demands, d) health concerns, f) interactions, and g) gaps in the health care system. Parents intuitively responded to the challenges and attempted to care for themselves. However, the role of the healthcare system to assist bereaved parents during this stressful time so that their health is not negatively impacted was also recognized. This study provides a foundation about parental bereavement challenges and related work that can lead to the development and testing of interventions that are tailored to address the challenges with a goal of improving bereaved parents health outcomes.

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{capacity}} design principles as well as of appropriate structural details, most of the reinforced concrete building designed primarily for gravity loads as typical of pre- 1970 s code provisions, are expected and has been demonstrate to suffer sever damage or total collapse under the earthquake excitation. Due to the use of plain round bar and inadequate reinforcing details, critical shear failure in the joint connection region could occur, leading to sever damage when not total collapse of the building. In this research project, a comprehensive experimental programme was carried to investigate the seismic performance of existing beam column joints prior and after retrofit intervention with a recently proposed low-invasive retrofit technique based on a metallic haunch system. The joint performance was evaluated in terms of the principal tensile stresses that caused the joint shear cracks in the joint panel zone. Quasi-static cyclic tests under uni-directional or bidirection loading regime were carried out to record the response of a series of under-designed beam column joints (with either a wide-beam or a deep-beam solution, deformed or plain round bars with end hooks). The experimental results were used to investigate the effect of structural detailing and loading regime on the seismic performance. To retrofit the potential deficiencies in the existing beam-column joints, the feasibility and efficiency of a low invasive retrofit solution based on a diagonal metallic haunch was investigated. The proposed haunch retrofit solution <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>provides</b> an economic, ease of implementation alternative to protect the joint from the brittle shear failure by relocating the beam plastic hinge away form the joint panel zone. To achieve the desired capacity design (hierarchy of strength) and sequence of event, a simplified analytical formulation has been adopted to account for the joint shear strength in terms of principle tensile/compression stresses prior and after the retrofit intervention. A useful visualization tool based on a M-N (moment-axial load) performance domain can be adopted to evaluate the actual performance point and events, by comparing demand vs. capacity. Designed charts are proposed based on displacement compatibility conditions to evaluate the efficiency of the haunch solution. In addition, a complete step-by step design procedure to implement the retrofit strategy and intervention to achieve the desired hierarchy of strength, by using the proposed diagonal metallic haunch solution, is derived and presented. The effectiveness of the proposed haunch solution and reliability of the derived analytical design/assessment procedure, were validated through experimental tests of 2 -D and 3 -D subassemblies, shown in the first experimental part to have the most vulnerable behaviour in the joint panel zone. Conceptual issues related to the design of the retrofit intervention, when moving from a 2 -D to a 3 -D behaviour are discussed. The experimental results showed an excellent performance of the proposed intervention, able to protect the panel zone region (by limiting the principle tensile stress demand), while enforcing the formation of a plastic hinge in the beam, far away from the joint interface. As a result, a much more stable inelastic response could be developed, confirming the high potential of such a low-invasive, low-cost retrofit intervention on under-designed frame systems. In conclusion, a simple numerical model, based on a lumped plasticity approach, was developed and validated on the experimental results to capture the full response of the subassembly prior and after the retrofit intervention...|$|E
40|$|Small-Medium-Enterprises (SMEs) play a {{critical}} part and are {{an important contribution to}} the economy in Australia, and the imperative to innovate has been greater than ever in a globalized economic setting. This research explored a number of questions surrounding SMEs, their innovation practices and the policy that influence them. This research builds on prior studies and addressed a significant gap within the literature in a descriptive and explanatory way. The statistics captured on innovation often provide a mixed view on the greater benefits in the form of increased productivity and higher value for the goods and services we produce. Though the value of statistical information and analysis is beneficial, it does not provide an in-depth view of the effects and benefits on small businesses, their owner(s) and the resultant innovation outcomes. The question may be posed, 'what actually happens and how does it (innovation) actually work in reality?' Each agent in the innovation process brings its own capabilities and strengths to this process. Broadly speaking, business brings the commercial and technological know-how, capital and access to distribution and markets, educational institutions the intellectual capital and linkages (a key driver for this research), while the key inputs from government are policy leadership, strategic focus, and overarching vision that enable these other agents and their capabilities to be 'joined together‘ into a coherent whole. In principle, these resultant interactions between these variables (business, education institutions, government) mentioned above must have delivered some contribution towards effective innovative solutions and practices in SMEs. This research reviewed and identified, through a case study approach with a series of in-depth qualitative data collection, analyses and discussions, barriers to innovation in micro-regional SME in Australia, and outlines recommendations for how these can be overcome. In essence, the research <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>provides</b> a deeper insight into what actually happens and why it happens; factors affecting innovation and technology transfer (I&TT) in regional micro-manufacturers, and describes an intervening investigation into the I&TT process in the SME sector within a University-Industry collaboration context. It is evidenced that this research field is well contributed by the large number of published research articles. However, the literature suffers from a lack of understanding of the meaning and reasons for the drivers for innovation. Hence, the principal purpose for this research to be undertaken. Four research questions were developed and these are presented in the form of propositions: • Proposition 1 : Failure and Novelty is mutually inclusive and is the governing principle behind innovation policy (ie. systematically grasping opportunities in the midst of change while minimising failures) ? • Proposition 2 : SMEs are not effective and efficient beneficiaries of innovation policies and their outputs (such as research, education and business support) ? • Proposition 3 : To what extent do influencing macro-environmental factors affect the decisions of firm‘s manager to innovate? • Proposition 4 : Regional universities can play an instrumental part in delivering support mechanisms for innovation within a networked cluster? In doing so, it explores and reflects on the innovation and technology transfer experience within a micro-manufacturer, obtained through embedment of one of the authors in an SME firm. The research initially focused on the manufacturing factors such as increasing productivity through work study and work-flow analysis, and introducing semi-automation and flexible manufacturing methodology. As the project progressed, however, several non-manufacturing factors were identified as major influences in the I&TT process within the targeted micro-manufacturer. The ability for firms to progress in improving the manufacturing factors is often dependent on these factors, which are categorized as very personal and business related (rather than technical related). The underlying project on which the work described is based involved a SWOT analysis on the business, learning and discovering the obstacles and barriers for I&TT, seeking and proposing ways to reduce it, and modeling the overall I&TT process within micro-manufacturers in regional areas, and termed Regional Knowledge Diffusion (RKD) model. This model developed through this research {{can be used as a}} conceptual framework for developing future policies for encouraging innovation and technology transfer within a university-industry context within the Small-Medium-Enterprise sector. Future research should aim at extending this qualitative research to a more diverse group of SMEs and importantly gaining a better understanding of the value systems, across a range of industries in a range of geographical locations in Australia and elsewhere, in order to evaluate the extent of and commitment of this sector to innovation at a wider level, and to better understand how this industry sector might benefit from closer links with universities and researchers. ...|$|E
40|$|This review {{combines}} two Presidential Addresses (2005, 2006) and <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>provides</b> an up-to-date {{overview of}} the stratigraphy and sedimentation of the Jurassic sequence of the Cleveland Basin (Yorkshire), including poorly known data from the western outcrop. These fascinating rocks have {{been the focus of}} geological research since the 18 th Century and have had a profound influence {{on the development of the}} geological sciences. Throughout the 20 th Century, the excellent coastal exposures have acted as a magnet for palaeontologists, stratigraphers, sedimentologists and geochemists, as a natural geological laboratory, and in recent decades, the coastal exposures received increased scientific interest as a result of their analogy with hydrocarbon source and reservoir rocks in the North Sea. Designation of the international Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Sinemurian–Pliensbachian stage boundary in Robin Hood's Bay, the establishment of the Dinosaur Coast, and development of the Rotunda Museum in Scarborough have all given the regional geology additional importance. The Lias Group (Hettangian–Toarcian age; 199. 6 – 175. 6 Ma), exposed in the well known coastal sections, is illustrated by the fully cored Felixkirk Borehole, located at the western margin of the outcrop, and is one of the best examples of shallow marine sedimentation in an epeiric shelf-sea setting. It comprises two large-scale, upward coarsening cycles, namely the Redcar Mudstone to Staithes Sandstone cycle, followed by the Cleveland Ironstone to Blea Wyke Sandstone cycle. Within this broad pattern, smaller scale transgressive–regressive cycles are described from stratigraphically expanded and reduced successions. Detailed ammonite biostratigraphy provides a finely calibrated temporal framework to study the variations in sedimentation, which include storm-generated limestones and sandstones (‘tempestites’) interbedded with mudstone deposited during fair-weather periods. Hemipelagic mud, occasionally organic-rich, reflects deeper-water anoxic events that may indicate a response to global climate change. In cores, the tempestite beds (Hettangian–Sinemurian) are characterized by sharp bases that, at outcrop, are often masked by downward penetrating burrows. Cyclicity on a centimetre scale in the overlying Pliensbachian ‘Banded Shales’ may be the result of orbitally induced, climatic cycles. Gradational upward coarsening to the Staithes Sandstone Formation marks a transition to sand-rich tempestite deposits, characterized by low angle and swaley cross-lamination, interbedded with sand-starved units (striped siltstones). The sands were probably deposited from sediment-laden, storm-surge and ebb currents in inner- and mid-shelf settings; the sandy substrate was, at some levels, extensively bioturbated by deposit feeding organisms that produced a spectacular range of trace fossil assemblages characteristic of shoreface, inner-, mid-, and outer-shelf settings. Intrabasinal tectonics was a controlling factor during deposition of both the Staithes Sandstone and the overlying Cleveland Ironstone (Late Pliensbachian). The influx of sand is attributed to hinterland uplift and increased sediment flux. More marked intraformational uplift during deposition of the Cleveland Ironstone is manifested in a much attenuated succession in the west of the basin (Felixkirk); southwards, towards the Market Weighton High, the Pecten/Main Seam of the ironstone oversteps unconformably onto progressively older beds to rest on the lower part of the Redcar Mudstone Formation. Ironstone, in the form of berthierine ooids and sideritic mud, was deposited during 5 – 6 cycles (in coastal exposures) of high sea-level stands that cut off siliciclastic influx from the low-gradient hinterland; regressive, upward-shoaling intervals are marked by interbedded, bioturbated siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. The Toarcian succession (Whitby Mudstone and Blea Wyke Sandstone formations) continues the second upward coarsening cycle in response to increased subsidence, rising sea-level, and an influx of siliciclastic sand. Oxygenated, open marine mud was deposited during the initial deepening phase, followed by bituminous mud, attributed to ocean-water stratification and the establishment of anoxic bottom conditions; in the west of the basin an upward shoaling sequence suggests that water depths were not as great. Recent research on the geochemistry and stable isotope signatures across this early Toarcian interval indicates a widespread, global anoxic event, possibly attributed to the release of methane hydrate on the ocean floor. The Alum Shale Member represents increasingly oxygenated bottom conditions and an upward coarsening motif with passage to the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation, which is preserved only in the Peak Trough, an actively subsiding graben. Basin uplift accompanied by gentle folding in late Toarcian to Aalenian times removed much of the late Toarcian succession so that the Middle Jurassic Dogger Formation (Aalenian), a complex, condensed, shallow water unit rests unconformably on beds as low as the Alum Shale over much of the basin. Deep boreholes and revision mapping by the British Geological Survey (BGS) in the west of the outcrop have allowed a fuller, basin-wide synthesis of the palaeoenvironments and the influence of intra-Jurassic tectonics during Mid- to Late Jurassic times. During Mid-Jurassic times the low-lying, paralic coastal plain, typified by braided and meandering fluvial systems and lacustrine deposits was invaded by marine incursions from the south and east. Each transgressive event was different in its geographical penetration across the coastal plain, resulting in varied lithofacies and palaeoenvironments including ooidal ironstone and lime mud (Eller Beck Formation), peloid and ooid carbonate shoals (Lebberston Member), and tidal sand bars, pelloidal limestones and nearshore marine muds (Scarborough Formation). Trace fossils, including dinosaur footprints, and macro-plant fossils tell us much about the palaeoenvironments on the coastal plain, during this time interval (175. 6 – 164. 7 Ma) that was characterized by a warm, seasonal climate. The basin wide transgression and marked global sea-level rise represented by the Cornbrash Formation, marks deposition in a shallow marine environment during the Callovian, followed by sand (Osgodby Formation) and deeper water muds (Oxford Clay Formation) that spread northwards from the East Midlands over the Market Weighton High during the Oxfordian. Subsequent shallowing of the basin resulted in the establishment of a carbonate/siliciclastic platform typified by ooidal shoals, coral patch reefs and sponge spicule-rich marine sands (Corallian Group). Their complex sedimentation pattern was influenced by local infra-Oxfordian tectonics related to the Howardian–Flamborough Fault Belt. Although the Ampthill Clay and Kimmeridge Clay formations, the latter representing the most important regional hydrocarbon source rock, are not well-exposed, recent boreholes in the Cleveland Basin have allowed a much better understanding of the hemi-pelagic marine environment (both oxic and anoxic) during this phase of sedimentation which marks a global sea-level rise. Although well-studied by world standards, the Jurassic sediments of the Cleveland Basin continue to throw up surprises and advances in our understanding of the Earth as a dynamic system over a period of c. [*] 30 million years. These studies have directly and indirectly influenced our understanding of the Earth as a system, and have played an important role in educating non-specialists, undergraduates and professional geologists over many decades...|$|E
