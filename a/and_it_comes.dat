5|$|The two routes {{continue}} {{to the southeast}} through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, and CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, {{as well as the}} Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting CR 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound; all other movements are provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses US 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing CR 585, the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and the abandoned Bernie Robbins Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from the boardwalk. Through New Jersey, US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C.|$|E

25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, the EZPpay system was {{expanded}} for overseas {{use during the}} aftermath of the 1992-1995 War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where U.S. personnel were deployed on peace-keeping missions. [...] Named [...] "EagleCash", the overseas system functions similarly to the EZpay system, but with the added ability of soldiers to attach personal bank accounts to the card, allowing them to load, and reload, without having to access their financial institutions back home. [...] As 386th Air Expeditionary Wing financial manager, Catherine Miles explained in a 2007 article, [...] "It's like a gift card. [...] You can put as little or as much money as you want on it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from your checking account." [...] Unlike regular debit cards, the Eagle Cash is managed on-base, using batch processing which ensures that the cards remained useful even when connections to banks and credit unions State-side are severed.
