5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy <b>and</b> <b>obvious,</b> he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E
60|$|To {{be natural}} {{is to be}} <b>obvious,</b> <b>and</b> to be <b>obvious</b> is to be inartistic.|$|R
30|$|From Definition  2.6, (1) <b>and</b> (2) are <b>obvious,</b> <b>and</b> hence we need {{to prove}} (3), (4) and (5).|$|R
6000|$|... "Naturally." [...] The man's lunacy was {{becoming}} more <b>and</b> more <b>obvious,</b> <b>and</b> yet there was such precision and coolness in his manner, that Robert found himself against his own reason endorsing and speculating over his plans.|$|R
5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E
25|$|A {{main supply}} valve with {{non-return}} valve, which supplies gas {{to the main}} gas supply hose of the umbilical. This is usually a quarter-turn valve, as it must be quick to operate <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> whether it is open or closed.|$|E

25|$|He quickly {{established}} himself as a prolific scorer, dazzling onlookers with his flashy play <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> talent. After two highly spectacular seasons, he was transferred, where he made a similar impact and awed fans and experts with his game.|$|E
25|$|One of many retaliatory {{air raids}} {{carried out by}} German/Ottoman airmen, {{occurred}} over El Arish on the same day, 19 January when the horse lines were targeted. Horse lines were easy <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> targets from the air; they continued to suffer heavily from air raids throughout the war.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce the}} CD, a dump of the live Wikipedia had been copied to a {{separate}} server, where a team of 70 Wikipedians vetted the material, deleting nonsense articles <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> copyright violations. Questionable articles were added to a special list, to be reviewed later. The final CD contained 132,000 articles and 1,200 images.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} humour, the two shows are very different. The Likely Lads {{had been a}} broad comedy, full of jokes <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> gags, whereas Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? used much subtler humour, derived from the {{dialogue}} and characterisation, often interspersed with sentimentality (as the Lads mourned their lost past), and even touches of pathos.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic Tales are a {{literary}} genre, concerning both hagiography of various Rebbes and moralistic themes. Some are anecdotes or recorded conversations dealing with matters of faith, practice, and the like. The most famous {{tend to be}} terse and carry a strong <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> point. They were often transmitted orally, though the earliest compendium is from 1815.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal de Châtillon {{participated in}} the famous Colloquy of Poissy {{in the summer of}} 1561. When the {{reformer}} Theodore de Beze arrived in Poissy on 23 August he was met with great ceremony <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> pleasure by the King of Navarre, the Prince de Condé and the Cardinal de Châtillon, almost with more honor (wrote Claude Haton) than the Pope of Rome would have received had he come.|$|E
25|$|His {{conclusion}} was thus that straight water-tubes were acceptable, <b>and</b> had <b>obvious</b> advantages for manufacture and cleaning in service.|$|R
3000|$|If so, Corollary 2.1 is also valid, with {{a similar}} proof <b>and</b> an <b>obvious</b> {{modification}} of the function spaces.|$|R

25|$|Capote {{forms an}} {{attachment}} to Smith. He empathizes with the convicted killer's unhappy childhood, and Smith's remorseful manner, genuine sincerity, <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> intelligence impress him. The criminal's reciprocal feelings become evident, although Smith has difficulty {{dealing with his}} emotions. As soon as Smith learns that Truman plans to title his book In Cold Blood, which suggests the author thinks of him only as a merciless killer, he violently subdues Capote and nearly rapes him.|$|E
25|$|The Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee {{explains}} {{any major}} magical accidents to the Muggles {{by creating a}} non-magical reason for the accident. For example, Peter Pettigrew killed twelve Muggle bystanders and tore apart the street (so as to reach the sewer pipe and escape) {{by means of an}} immense explosion curse during his altercation with Sirius Black. The massive <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> damage and mortality was explained by the committee as due to a tragic accidental explosion of the gas main.|$|E
25|$|We {{learn as}} girls that in ways both subtle <b>and</b> <b>obvious,</b> {{personal}} and political, our value as females is largely determined by how we look. … For black women, {{the domination of}} physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black women find themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define {{in a culture that}} provides them no positive reflection.|$|E

25|$|Wilkins {{is one of}} the few {{persons to}} have headed a college at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. He was a polymath, {{although}} not one of the most important scientific innovators of the period. His personal qualities were brought out, <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> to his contemporaries, in reducing political tension in Interregnum Oxford, in founding the Royal Society on non-partisan lines, and in efforts to reach out to religious nonconformists. He was one of the founders of the new natural theology compatible with the science of the time.|$|E
25|$|Continuing to {{push their}} {{development}} agenda, on February 21, 2013, members of the Orange County planning commission, voted to approve a re-zoning application in the Germanna area, and redesignate what had been an Agricultural zone to a commercial and high-density residential area. Despite 90% of the local residents in attendance request for denial, <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> ethical and conflict of interest issues, the application was passed by J.P. Tucker III (Owner of a construction company), Andy Hutchinson (Owner of a sod company), and Donald Brooks (political candidate for Sheriff).|$|E
25|$|The most {{immediate}} <b>and</b> <b>obvious</b> obstacle to realization {{of these goals}} {{is the fact that}} two historic Islamic structures which are 13 centuries old, namely the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, are built on top of the Temple Mount. Israel has undertaken to ensure access to the Temple Mount for peaceful worshippers and visitors, while maintaining public order and security. Any efforts to damage or reduce access to these sites, or to build Jewish structures within, between, beneath, beside, cantilevered on top of, or instead of them, could lead to severe international conflicts, given the association of the Muslim world with these holy places.|$|E
