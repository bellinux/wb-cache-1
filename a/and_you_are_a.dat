5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> sinner all of your life. No matter how {{you try to get}} away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. But she understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to try something different, Madonna wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to indicate what could be popular in music. However, being raised as a Catholic, Madonna felt guilty about the failure of her marriage. She said, [...] "Because in Catholicism you are a born sinner <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> sinner all your life. ... I could not escape my past, nor could I relax". Saddened by what was happening with her, Madonna missed her family, her father and her siblings. She confessed to Becky Johnston for Interview magazine: ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional weapons saw {{substantial}} use {{well into}} the century, and weapons systems such as cavalry, archers, and spearmen clashed in many areas. The Mandingo horsemen of the Liberian hinterland for example were said to call out to fearful or fleeing infantry opponents with two options: [...] "Stand <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> slave; run <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> corpse." [...] Mounted troops however were far from invincible. Bowmen made {{up the bulk of}} infantry strength in many areas, and the use of poisoned arrows and a rapid volume of fire partially offset weaknesses in bow strength and unfletched arrows. Against determined combinations of archers and spearmen, properly positioned and deployed, cavalry could be beaten. Just such a scenario unfolded in 1804, when Fulani groups proclaimed a jihad against the cavalry heavy state of Gobir, in what is today's Northern Nigeria. The Fulani, under Usman Dan Fodio, a religious reformer and teacher, suffered a number of initial setbacks against the fast-moving Gobir cavalry, most notably at the Battle of Tsuntua where some 2,000 men were lost.|$|E

2500|$|Ritchie {{also gave}} a {{controversial}} Daily Telegraph interview during his Sandhurst tenure, {{in which he}} discussed suitable placements for army officers with the words, [...] "Clearly, if say a regiment plays a lot of polo <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> rugby player, you probably won't {{want to go to}} the polo-playing regiment", before conceding in the same interview, [...] "I rather regret using that example", and stressed that the army was far more accessible today than when he first joined in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1943, Parks became {{active in}} the Civil Rights Movement, joined the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, and was elected secretary. She later said, [...] "I {{was the only woman}} there, and they needed a secretary, and I was too timid to say no." [...] She {{continued}} as secretary until 1957. She worked for the local NAACP leader Edgar Nixon, even though he maintained that [...] "Women don't need to be nowhere but in the kitchen."

2500|$|Instead of {{pursuing}} a fleeing enemy, as his orders had directed, A.P. Hill had attacked an entrenched Union position, losing about 2,000 of his 13,200 {{men in the}} failed attempt. Combined with his attacks at Mechanicsville the previous day, the Light Division had lost {{over a quarter of}} its men. General McClellan was encouraged by the telegrams Porter sent back to his headquarters a few miles to the rear. He replied, [...] "If the enemy are retiring <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> chasseur, pitch in." [...] He also told Franklin to cross the river over the Duane bridge and attack the enemy's flank if he saw a chance, but he was dismayed to hear that the VI Corps commander had destroyed the bridge for fear of a possible enemy attack. At the same time, Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner of the II Corps reported enemy activity in his front. McClellan's optimism was dashed and he ordered that his headquarters equipment be packed up in preparation for the retreat. On the Confederate side, General Lee had been an active participant in the failed assault, rallying his troops too close to the front for their comfort. As Longstreet arrived to the southwest of A.P. Hill, he saw the difficulty of attacking over such terrain and delayed until Stonewall Jackson could attack on Hill's left.|$|E

2500|$|One way or another, Nell's father {{seems to}} have been out of the picture by the time of her {{childhood}} in Covent Garden, and her [...] "dipsomaniac mother, [...] sister", Rose, were left in a low situation. She experimented with cross-dressing between 1663-1667 going under the name [...] "William Nell" [...] and adopting a false beard; her observations informed a most successful and hilarious character interpretation acting as a man on the stage in March 1667. Old Madam Gwyn was by most accounts an alcoholic whose business was running a bawdy house (or brothel). There, or in the bawdy house of one Madam Ross, Nell would spend at least some time. It is possible she worked herself as a child prostitute; Peter Thomson, in the Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre, says it is [...] "probable". A rare mention of her upbringing from the source herself might be seen to contradict the idea: A 1667 entry in Samuel Pepys' diary records, second-hand, thatHere Mrs. Pierce tells me [...] that Nelly and Beck Marshall, falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord Buckhurst's whore. Nell answered then, [...] "I was but one man's whore, though I was brought up in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the guests; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> whore to three or four, though a Presbyter's praying daughter!". However, it is not out of the question that Gwyn was merely echoing the satirists of the day, if she said this at all.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study {{applies the}} science of {{pathology}} to the human species {{in order to identify}} and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology. In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: [...] "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field." [...] The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as [...] "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed." [...] About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: [...] "he study of evil is just beginning <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> pioneer." [...] Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: [...] "Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil." [...] Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: [...] "This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book." [...] Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.|$|E
