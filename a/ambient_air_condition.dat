30|$|In conclusion, {{we studied}} {{the effect of}} {{moisture}} on the formation of perovskite films in detail, and found that moisture can speed up the crystallizing process of PbI 2 films to form poor-quality films with large grain size and surface roughness, while, for the conversion of PbI 2 to MAPbI 3 films, {{a small amount of}} moisture is not adverse, and even beneficial. On this basis, by adding a small amount of BTA into the solution of PbI 2 to enhance the quality of PbI 2 films and thus to achieve high-quality perovskite films with smooth surface, large crystal grains, and high crystal quality, we fabricated mesoporous PSCs with PCE of 16.00 % under ambient air conditions at 25 % RH.

40|$|Abstract [338] The goal of {{this paper}} is to suggest the {{numerical}} method for the simulation of impulsive sound generation and to investigate the acoustic field produced by a projectile discharging from a muzzle. For this problem, a direct simulation using the conventional flow computation method is performed to obtain the acoustic source information in near-field. Computed unsteady flow results are used to obtain the solutions in far-field. Hybrid method using the flow results computed in near-field boundary region combined with an integral formulation to evaluate the radiated noise in far-field is suggested. First, a numerical study on wave dynamic procedure occurring in muzzle flows, which are made by a supersonic projectile released from the open end of a tube into <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>condition,</b> is implemented. From numerical simulation in near-field, such complex phenomena, including blast waves, jet flows, shock waves and their interactions in the muzzle blast, are described.

40|$|Hypoxia is a {{critical}} condition governing many aspects of cellular fate processes. The most common practice in hypoxic cell culture is to maintain cells in an incubator with controlled gas inlet (i. e., hypoxic chamber). Here, we describe the design and characterization of enzyme-immobilized hydrogels to create solution hypoxia under ambient conditions for in vitro cancer cell culture. Specifically, glucose oxidase (GOX) was acrylated and co-polymerized with poly(ethylene glycol) -diacrylate (PEGDA) through photopolymerization to form GOX-immobilized PEG-based hydrogels. We first evaluated the effect of soluble GOX on inducing solution hypoxia (O 2 < 5 %) and found that both unmodified and acrylated GOX could sustain hypoxia for at least 24 h even under <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> with constant oxygen diffusion from the air-liquid interface. However, soluble GOX gradually lost its ability to sustain hypoxia after 24 h due {{to the loss of}} enzyme activity over time. On the other hand, GOX-immobilized hydrogels were able to create hypoxia within the hydrogel for at least 120 h, potentially due to enhanced protein stabilization by enzyme ‘PEGylation’ and immobilization. As a proof-of-concept, this GOX-immobilized hydrogel system was used to create hypoxia for in vitro culture of Molm 14 (acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line) and Huh 7 (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line). Cells cultured in the presence of GOX-immobilized hydrogels remained viable for at least 24 h. The expression of hypoxia associated genes, including carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA 9) and lysyl oxidase (LOX), were significantly upregulated in cells cultured with GOX-immobilized hydrogels.

40|$|Effects of {{irradiance}} on photosynthetic {{characteristics were}} examined in senescent leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two irradiance treatments (100 and 20 % natural sunlight) were imposed after the full expansion of the 13 th leaf through senescence. The photosynthetic rate was measured {{as a function of}} intercellular CO 2 pressure with a gas-exchange system. The amounts of cytochrome f, coupling factor 1, ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), and chlorophyll were determined. The coupling factor 1 and cytochrome f contents decreased rapidly during senescence, and their rates of decrease were much faster from the 20 % sunlight treatment than from the full sunlight treatment. These changes were well correlated with those in the photosynthetic rate at CO 2 pressure = 600 microbars, but not with those under the <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> (350 microbars CO 2) and 200 microbars CO 2. This suggested that the amounts of coupling factor 1 and cytochrome f from the full sunlight treatment cannot be limiting factors for the photosynthetic rate at ambient air conditions. The Rubisco content also decreased during senescence, but its decrease from the 20 % sunlight treatment was appreciably retarded. However, this difference was not reflected in the photosynthetic rates at the ambient and 200 microbars CO 2. This implied that in vivo Rubisco activity may be regulated in the senescent leaves from the 20 % sunlight treatment. The chlorophyll content decreased most slowly. In the 20 % sunlight treatment, it remained apparently constant with a decline in chlorophyll a/b ratio. These photosynthetic characteristics of the senescent rice leaves under low irradiance were discussed in relation to acclimation of shade plants...|$|E

The proposed system utilizes a selective membrane to remove water vapor from ambient air {{as opposed to a}} vapor compression cycle or a desiccant. This work provides an analysis of the membrane dehumidification system with a focus on the energy performance of the system. A system performance goal was set at the beginning for a given inlet and outlet <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> and a total cooling load of one ton. The target COP of the combined sensible and latent cooling is 3. 58 with a target value for only the latent system of 3. 34. Two different simulations were developed including an initial simulation which uses a basic mass transfer model and a simpler condenser model. The initial model was used to develop the system, analyze operating parameters and provide initial performance results. The initial simulations indicate that the system requires two optimizations to meet the target performance: condenser pressure optimization and the use of multiple membrane segments operating at different pressures. The latent only COP including the optimizations was a maximum of 4. 23. A second model was then developed which uses a more detailed mass transfer model and a more detailed condenser model based on the operating conditions. This simulation yielded a maximum latent only COP of 4. 37 including the optimizations. The work also analyzes two different combined systems capable of providing both sensible and latent cooling. The first utilizes a conventional vapor compression cycle for sensible cooling and has a maximum COP of 3. 93. The second uses multiple evaporative coolers in between multiple membrane dehumidification steps and was found to have a maximum COP of 3. 73. Second law analysis of the systems was also conducted and found that the greatest reduction in latent system exergy loss can be obtained by improving the selectivity of the membrane. Apart from improving the membrane selectivity, the results show the greatest improvement can be found in improving the operation of the gas compression devices...|$|E

40|$|The ground source {{heat pump}} (GSHP) {{technology}} is a renewable alternative for space conditioning by rejecting/absorbing heat to/from the ground, which has demonstrated higher energy efficiency for residential and commercial buildings. As the system capacity is limited by the initial cost of construction of ground-loop heat exchanger (GHE), developing the so-called Hybrid GSHP system by utilizing supplemental heat rejecters such as cooling towers has emerged as a cost-effective alternative. In practice, operational efficiency of Hybrid GSHP system mainly depends on 1) the actual characteristics of heat pump, cooling tower, GHE and other equipment; 2) ambient air and ground conditions. In particular, the GHE heat transfer is heavily affected by the ground thermal characteristics which, however, is difficult and expensive in practice to determine due to the complexity of soil type and distribution. In addition, the actual cooling tower characteristics can vary significantly. Such uncertainties bring forth dramatic difficulty for successful application of model based control or optimization methods. In this study, an extremum seeking control (ESC) strategy is proposed for efficient operation of a hybrid GSHP system with cooling tower, which minimizes the total power (i. e. GHE loop water pump, cooling tower fan and pump, and the heat-pump compressor) consumption by tuning the air-flow rate of the cooling tower fan and the GHE loop water flow rate. To evaluate the proposed control method, a Modelica based model of the Hybrid GSHP system is developed by utilizing the Buildings Library developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which consists of a 20 -borehole GHE, a water-to-water heat pump, a counter-flow cooling tower and a plate heat exchanger. The transient conduction model of vertical GHE in the Buildings Library is adopted, which is based on a finite-volume method inside the borehole and cylindrical source model outside the borehole. A variable-flow water pump model is constructed for the GHE water loop, which gives power consumption under different operating scenarios. A cooling tower model in the Buildings Library is adopted, which is a static polynomial model based on a York cooling tower correlation. The relative air flow rate can be regulated to maintain the leaving water temperature at the setpoint, and then the corresponding fan power consumption is obtained. The heat pump model is based on the evaporator temperature, condenser temperature and Carnot efficiency. An inner-loop proportional-integral (PI) controller is implemented to regulate the evaporator leaving water temperature at 7 deg-C. Under the air wet-bulb temperature of 35 deg-C and dry-bulb temperature 23 deg-C, steady-state simulation of the plant model yields the static map of the total power with respect to the cooling tower relative air flow rate and the GHE water flow rate, which indicates about 25 % power variation across the adjustable range of inputs. Simulation was conducted in two conditions: change in evaporator inlet water temperature and change in <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>condition.</b> The simulation study under way is to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ESC strategy, and the potential for energy saving will also be evaluated...|$|E

The objectives of this study were to design a modified atmosphere perforated plastic packaging system to extend shelf life and marketability of fresh chillies. Physiological data about fresh green 'Cayenne' chillies was measured; respiration rate, internal partial pressure of O (P O) and CO (p CO), skin permeance to O (P′O), CO (P′CO) and water vapour (P′HO) as well as, water activity (a). The extent to which these attributes were affected by a range of temperatures 5, 10, 20 and 30 °C was also characterised. Respiration dramatically increased as storage temperature was increased from 5 to 30 °C, whilst P′O and P′CO slightly increased. The differing effects of temperature on these two variables were responsible for the depression of internal partial pressure of O and elevation of CO internal partial pressure. The skin permeances to O and CO were very close (approximate ratio P′CO :P′O as 1. 06) and it was determined that the major pathway for gas exchange of green 'Cayenne' chillies was dominated by movement through pores (through the stem area), rather than the cuticle. Average value of skin permeance to water vapour of green 'Cayenne' chillies was 201. 78 nmol·s ·m ·Pa. Water vapour permeances were inconsistent over the 5 - 30 °C temperature range due to errors from thermistor probes and environment around chillies. Surface area of green 'Cayenne' chillies provided the positive relationship with fresh weight, volume and the rate of water loss (measured at ambient temperature ≈ 20 °C). Fresh weight and a of fresh chillies decreased as the storage temperature increased from 5 to 30 °C. Storage temperatures (5, 10, 20 and 30 °C) and packaging types (perforated/nonperforated plastic bags and unpackaging) had significant impact on storage qualities (colour, firmness, weight and decay) of fresh green 'Cayenne' chillies during a 2 -week storage trial period. Refrigerated storage temperatures and perforated plastic bag showed promise in reducing quality attributes changes and eliminating condensation. At 5 and 10 °C, no signs of chilling injury were detected on green 'Cayenne' in any packaging type used during the trial period. The atmospheres inside perforated plastic bag were similar to <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>condition,</b> thus ensuring that there were aerobic conditions inside. The rate of weight loss of packaged chillies varied with storage temperature, perforation area and size of perforation. The optimum storage condition and package for a 100 g retail pack of chillies during a 2 -week storage period is 5 °C and 152. 40 × 228. 60 mm plastic bag with 0. 49 % perforation area (2. 5 mm perforation size). Chillies stored under this condition had low percentage of weight loss (less than 2. 5 %) with no signs of chilling injury and their quality attributes were within the marketable levels. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) were used to study effects of postharvest disinfecting treatments (sodium hypochlorite (NaClO, 2 %w/v) and hot water dip (HWD, 53 °C 4 minutes)) on storage quality. Both disinfectants significantly reduced decay appearances on bell peppers particularly on those stored at high temperature (20 and 30 °C), during a trial 2 -week storage period. The application of these disinfecting treatments will be further researched on fresh chillies, for minimising decay appearance. The 'Weight Loss Simulator' model developed by Tanner (1998) was tested by comparing predicted weight loss with experimental data. The model had general agreement with the experimentally observed trends. Lack of fit of model predictions to experimental data however, was obvious in some cases. Variations, e. g. storage temperature/relative humidity, packaging and dynamic changes in biological properties of stored chillies can deviate the predicting result of this model. Sensitivity analyses performed on the model showed that the observed lack of fit could largely be explained by estimated uncertainties in the respiration rate data. From this model testing, the accuracy of the 'Weight Loss Simulator' model appeared to be limited by assumptions, input data and uncertainties occurred during data collection rather than by shortcomings in the model itself...|$|E
40|$|Extended X-ray {{absorption}} {{fine structure}} (EXAFS) measurements {{have been carried}} out to explore the size-dependent structure of deposited Cu_η clusters using the element-specific K_α fluorescence signal of copper. In particular, Cu_ 55 and Cu_ 35 have been deposited on a thin natural silica layer of a Si(100) wafer and have been investigated under both ultra-high vacuum and <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditions.</b> Pieces of evidence of an icosahedral structure of Cu_ 55 and a densely-packed compact fcc-like geometry of Cu_ 35 are concluded from a comparison of the magnitude EXAFS spectra and FEFF simulations of the geometry of the corresponding free clusters. The exceedingly small radial distances as revealed from the radial distribution plots of the pristine clusters can be explained by a severe increase (∼ 100...|$|R
30|$|Although {{many groups}} {{have been trying to}} prepare {{perovskite}} solar cells (PSCs) in <b>ambient</b> <b>air,</b> the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still low. Besides, the effect of moisture on the formation of perovskite films is still controversial. In this paper, we studied the effect of moisture on the formation of perovskite films in detail, and found that moisture can speed up the crystallizing process of PbI 2 films to form poor-quality films with large grain size and surface roughness, while, for the conversion of PbI 2 to perovskite films, a small amount of moisture is not adverse, and even beneficial. On this basis, we report the successful fabrication of efficient mesoporous PSCs with PCE of 16.00 % under <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditions</b> at 25 % relative humidity by adding a small amount of n-butyl amine into the solution of PbI 2 to enhance the quality of PbI 2 films and thus to achieve high-quality perovskite films with smooth surface, large crystal grains, and high crystal quality.|$|R
