Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E

5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of <b>a</b> <b>feminist</b> model of economic actors.

5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary.
