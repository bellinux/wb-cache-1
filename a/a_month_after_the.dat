5|$|<b>A</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> election, the {{lame-duck session}} of the old 67th Congress met. Harding {{had come to believe}} that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.|$|E

5|$|By 1991, most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from Armenia {{were forced}} to move to their {{respective}} countries, as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible. Although Armenia had proclaimed its independence from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990, {{it was not until}} on 21 September 1991, <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> failed August Coup in Moscow, when the overwhelming majority of Armenians voted for the independence in a nationwide referendum.
