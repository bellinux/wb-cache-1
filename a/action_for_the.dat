5|$|Campbell {{made his}} return to {{training}} in March 2011. Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered a recurrence of the ligament injury in the same knee {{in preparation for a}} match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell would be out of action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to stave off the}} Civil War, Dixon participated in a {{convention}} of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At the outset of the war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair and putting it out of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the war. The base was {{handed over to the}} Allies, {{along with the rest of}} occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E

5|$|In this context, Tătărescu {{chose to}} back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, {{remained}} active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning {{it had never been}} enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following years. Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brătianu's political allies.|$|E

5|$|On 25 May a French {{ship was}} seen and followed, which {{after three days}} led the British to the main French fleet. Howe gave the order to prepare for battle at 09:45 on 28May and at 10:35 to form into two columns. In an attempt to force an action, some of the fastest ships were sent to attack the French rear, which they did {{throughout}} the day, both causing and receiving some damage. The two fleets came together on 29May, and a limited engagement took place that petered out and became a general chase after an attempt to cut the French line was mistimed. Thick fog prevented any further <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next two days.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1916, Wark was {{attached}} to the 32nd Battalion, a position that became permanent on 18 November.

By February he was back with the 32nd Battalion, and took part in actions at Sunray Trench during March. For these, and further actions at Fromelles, Wark was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order, but the award was never made. He was promoted to major on 27 April, and in June was granted six days of leave to Paris.|$|E
