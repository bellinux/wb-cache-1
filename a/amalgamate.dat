Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to <b>amalgamate</b> the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to <b>amalgamate</b> {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E

5|$|The GPK and the GD {{had already}} been {{authorised}} by the Acts of 1846 and 1847 to <b>amalgamate</b> at this stage. In fact the GD was absorbed by the GPK which then {{changed its name to}} the G; the 1847 Act provided for the vesting of the GD in the GPK on the date of the opening throughout of the GD, when that company would be dissolved. From the date of the amalgamation the company would be called the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E

5|$|In 1861 {{permission}} {{was granted}} to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a day over the line, which gave an alternative route between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission {{was given to the}} Morayshire and Great North to <b>amalgamate</b> with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn without notice the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North.|$|E

In 2001, Flight International reported that Taiwan might meet its requirement for a short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the F-16 Fighting Falcon's APG-66 radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed the production line to stay open beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.|$|E
5|$|The Counties (Detached parts) Act 1844 was {{originally}} designed to eradicate exclaves or 'islands' and <b>amalgamate</b> the area with the surrounding county; Worcestershire however, still possessed many 'outliers' to the south east. This was before enactment of the Provisional Order Confirmation (Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire) Act 1931 which nearly completed the task of amalgamating Worcestershire's islands into their surrounding county, except for Dudley. This act transferred Blockley, Daylesford and Evenlode to Gloucestershire, whilst Warwickshire gained Alderminster, Tidmington and Tredington. The whole of Shipston-on-Stour Rural District was also merged into Warwickshire and subsequently amalgamated with Brailes Rural District.|$|E
5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to <b>amalgamate</b> the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E

5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the violence of the Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to <b>amalgamate</b> the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton was {{the second}} most populous urban {{district}} in the United Kingdom by the 1930s, and the district council took initial steps to obtain municipal borough status, {{but this was not}} achieved. In 1926 and 1931, two Oldham Extension Bills for the County Borough of Oldham to <b>amalgamate</b> with Chadderton Urban District were rejected by the House of Lords, following objections from neighbouring councils. A twinning arrangement was made in 1966 by Chadderton Urban District Council with Geesthacht, West Germany. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Chadderton Urban District was abolished, and Chadderton has, since 1April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Chadderton has three of the twenty wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham: Chadderton North, Chadderton Central and Chadderton South., with some small perhipheral areas lying in the neighbouring wards of Royton North, Coldhurst, Hollinwood, Werneth and Failsworth East.|$|E

Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to run by a group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day came, and thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out for more, and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to <b>amalgamate,</b> and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E
5|$|In October 1947, the War Office {{announced}} {{its intention to}} reduce the division's strength by one brigade. The 3rd Parachute Brigade, being more recently established than the other units, was selected to be disbanded. However, instead of disbanding its battalions, {{it was decided to}} <b>amalgamate</b> them. The 3rd Parachute Battalion joined with the 2nd Parachute Battalion and was renumbered the 2nd/3rd Parachute Battalion, and the brigade's other two battalions were amalgamated to become the 8th/9th Parachute Battalion. Both of these new units would serve in the 1st Parachute Brigade. The amalgamation of the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions was completed in December, and the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions in early January. Finally, the brigade headquarters was disbanded at the end of January. During their service in Palestine, nine men from the brigade had been killed.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1960, the Australian Army {{adopted the}} Pentropic divisional structure, {{which was based}} on the {{establishment}} of five-company battalions. The result of this was a {{reduction in the number of}} CMF units, many of which were merged to form new units on the Pentropic establishment. At the same time, it was decided to <b>amalgamate</b> the old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments, such as the Royal Victoria Regiment. As a result of these changes, in July the 6th Battalion was merged with the 5th Battalion and the 58th/32nd Battalion to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (1 RVR); within this organisation the 6th Battalion's identity was maintained by 'C' (Melbourne) Company. Prior to this, in March, the battalion had received the Freedom of the City from the City of Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated {{with the}} GWR on 1 January 1876. It {{had already made}} a start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task {{completed}} through to Exeter on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station here had been shared with the LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the South Devon Railway to also <b>amalgamate</b> with the Great Western. The Cornwall Railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held {{a large number of}} shares in the company. One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the St Ives branch in west Cornwall, although there was also a small extension at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth in 1879. Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge trackwork remaining in situ anywhere.|$|E
5|$|The CardwellChilders reforms {{from the}} 1860s to the 1880s {{substantially}} reorganised the British Army, principally by amalgamating single-battalion regiments to form regiments of multiple battalions. The King's, which already had two regular battalions, did not <b>amalgamate,</b> but did adopt a new title on the numbering system's abolition. Thus, on 1 July 1881, the two battalions of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, The King's (Liverpool) Regiment. The 8th Foot had {{been associated with}} Liverpool since 1873, when it became allocated to the town's 13th Brigade Depot. Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through {{the integration of the}} militia and volunteers, of which nine from Lancashire and the Isle of Man transferred to the King's and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it was decided}} to <b>amalgamate</b> old local and {{regional}} regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments. While the pentropic system eventually fell by the wayside, these regiments have endured, maintaining the battle honours of the previously existing Militia units that had perpetuated the units of the AIF and serving as a valuable link to the traditions and service of earlier units. Nevertheless, many CMF soldiers felt that the introduction of these regiments reduced the Army's links to the community due to the move away from the traditional regionally based system and as a result many of these soldiers chose to leave the organisation. In 1965, as the pentropic system was abandoned, a further re-organisation of the CMF was undertaken as existing battalions were reduced and additional battalions were raised in the more populous areas, namely in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. Concerns about the regional identity of these units were addressed by reintroducing the old numerical designations. In 1966, the Army authorised the raising of six remote area battalions, one in each state. These units offered special conditions of service for men who could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence. Ultimately though the Tasmanian battalion was never formed.|$|E
