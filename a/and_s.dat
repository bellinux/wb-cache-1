5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening {{in most parts of}} the world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane was a native of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India <b>and</b> <b>S.</b> edule <b>and</b> <b>S.</b> officinarum coming from New Guinea.

30|$|The {{results suggest}} that the rupture during the Tohoku-Oki {{earthquake}} consists of at least four stages. The rupture propagated about 100 km in a northerly directions during times between 30 <b>s</b> <b>and</b> 80 <b>s</b> <b>and</b> apparently accelerated at times between 60 <b>s</b> <b>and</b> 80 <b>s.</b> The rupture seems to have restarted near the origin between 80 <b>s</b> <b>and</b> 100 <b>s,</b> then decreased to − 60 km in the next 30 s. This indicates that the rupture propagated to the southwest off the Miyagi Prefecture. Then, the rupture suddenly jumped to the farther southwest at a time of 130 s. This jump implies that the rupture took place off the southern Fukushima Prefecture. And the rupture further extended to off Ibaraki Prefecture at times between 130 <b>s</b> <b>and</b> 170 <b>s.</b> The rupture seems to have mostly stayed at about − 240 km at times between 180 <b>s</b> <b>and</b> 210 <b>s.</b>|$|R

40|$|Association of the 30 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 50 <b>S</b> {{subunits}} {{to generate}} the 70 S ribosomes of Escherichia coli {{has long been known}} but the mechanism of this interaction remains obscure. Light-scattering studies indicate that naked 16 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>S</b> RNAs can also associate under conditions similar to those required for the assembly of ribosomes from the constituent RNAs and proteins. The RNA-RNA association also takes place in the presence of ethanol, which promotes folding of 16 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>S</b> RNAs into specific compact structures with the morphological features of 30 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 50 <b>S</b> ribosomes, respectively. Equimolar amounts of the two RNAs are involved in the association. The formation of a stoichiometric complex was shown by light scattering, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and composite polyacrylamide/agarose gel electrophoresis. The presence of the two species of RNA in the complex was also shown by gel electrophoresis. The association of naked 16 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>S</b> RNAs suggests that RNA-RNA interaction may {{play an important role in}} the association of 30 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 50 <b>S</b> subunits...|$|R

There was no hybridization between 5 <b>S</b> rRNA <b>and</b> 5. 8 <b>S</b> rRNA genes, though a hexa and a hepta nucleotide sequence homologies are found between them.

40|$|Four {{types of}} ribosomes {{occurring}} in E. coli have been separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation.

Two criteria were used in comparing these particles: (1) The type of RNA contained in each, as determined by sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge. (2) The ability of mixtures of 30 <b>S</b> <b>and</b> 50 <b>S</b> ribosomes (derived 30 S + derived 50 S, native 30 S + native 50 S) to undergo the reaction: [Formula: see text] Native <b>and</b> derived 30 <b>S</b> particles were found to contain 16 S RNA.
