2500|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} {{finds its}} major application {{in the production}} of PVC. It is volatile, so the primary exposure is via inhalation as against food or water with occupational hazards being highest. Prior to 1974, workers were commonly exposed to 1,000 ppm vinyl chloride, causing [...] "vinyl chloride illness" [...] such as <b>acroosteolysis</b> and Raynaud's Phenomenon. The symptoms of vinyl chloride exposure are classified by ppm levels in ambient air with 4,000 ppm having a threshold effect. The intensity of symptoms varies from acute (1,000-8,000 ppm), including dizziness, nausea, visual disturbances, headache, and ataxia, to chronic (above 12,000 ppm), including narcotic effect, cardiac arrhythmias, and fatal respiratory failure. RADS (Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome) may be caused by acute exposure to vinyl chloride.|$|E

50|$|Skin biopsy {{is another}} way to {{diagnose}} PDP. However, it is not a very specific method, because other diseases share the same skin alterations with PDP, such as myxedema and hypothyroidism. In order to exclude these other diseases, hormonal studies are done. For example, thyrotropin and growth hormone levels should be examined to exclude thyroid acropachy and acrome. However, skin biopsy helps to diagnose PDP in patients without skin manifestations. When clubbing is observed, it is helpful to check whether <b>acroosteolysis</b> of distal phalanges of fingers is present. This is useful to diagnose PDP, because the combination of clubbing and <b>acroosteolysis</b> is only found in PDP and Cheneyâ€™s syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Mandibuloacral {{dysplasia}} {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} syndrome characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, delayed cranial suture closure, dysplastic clavicles, abbreviated and club-shaped terminal phalanges, <b>acroosteolysis,</b> atrophy of {{the skin of the}} hands and feet, and typical facial changes.|$|E
50|$|PGE2 can {{mimic the}} {{activity}} of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (respectively building and breaking down bone tissue). This is why <b>acroosteolysis</b> and periosteal bone formation {{can be explained by}} the action of PGE2. Furthermore, PGE2 has vasodilatory effects, which is consistent with prolonged local vasodilation in digital clubbing.|$|E
50|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids {{are most}} used in PDP treatment. These drugs inhibit cyclo-oxygenase activity and thereby prostaglandin synthesis. Since PGE2 {{is likely to}} be involved in periosteal bone formation and <b>acroosteolysis,</b> this is why these drugs can alleviate the polyarthritis associated with PDP. In addition, NSAIDs and corticosteroids decrease formation of inflammatory mediators, reducing inflammation and pain. In case of possible gastropathy, the COX-2 selective NSAID etorixocib is preferred.|$|E
50|$|Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, {{also called}} <b>acroosteolysis</b> with {{osteoporosis}} {{and changes in}} skull and mandible, arthrodentoosteodysplasia, and Cheney syndrome, is an extremely rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder of the connective tissue characterized by severe and excessive bone resorption leading to osteoporosis and {{a wide range of}} other possible symptoms. Mutations in the NOTCH2 gene, identified in 2011, cause HCS. HCS is so rare that only about 70 cases have been reported worldwide, since the discovery of the syndrome in 1948.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. <b>Acroosteolysis</b> is a recognized, but under-researched and {{forgotten}} manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Objective. To present {{a case of}} exuberant <b>acroosteolysis</b> and subcutaneous tissue calcinosis {{in the course of}} SSc. Case report. The patient, aged fifty-three with limited systemic sclerosis (lSSc) for 8 years duration, was under dermatological treatment because of ulcerative inflammation of the 2 nd and 4 th finger of the right hand. Progressive <b>acroosteolysis</b> of the distal phalanx with calcinosis and severe digital ischaemia was diagnosed. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{patient was}} a 74 -year-old gentleman with {{underlying}} palmoplantar psoriasis (fi gure 1). He was electively admit-ted for left below knee amputation for cutaneous {{squamous cell carcinoma}} at his left heel with locoregional spread. He was incidentally found to have symmetrical shortening of his fi ngers. On further questioning, we discovered that this had occurred {{over a period of}} 5 years. He had no joint pain, symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon or traumatic hand injury. On examination, there was symmetrical shortening of the distal phalanges with loss of nails in most of the dig-its (fi gure 2). Connective tissue screening was negative for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor and anti topoi-somerase I. Radiograph of the hands showed terminal resorption of the distal phalanges that is, <b>acroosteolysis.</b> There were no erosions of the articular surfaces (fi gure 3). The radiographs of his feet were normal. <b>Acroosteolysis</b> is a recognised radiological fi nding in psoriatic arthropathy; which may precede psoriasis by years. 1 The other well-established aetiologies of <b>acroosteolysis</b> are scleroderma, frostbite and hyperparathyroidism. This case highlights the occurrence of psoriatic <b>acroosteolysis</b> in the absence of psoriatic arthropathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case of its kind. 2 In 1959, Buckley et al reported a case of psoriasis with progressive osteolysis fol-lowing trauma. This was thought to be linked to Koebner phenomenon which is known to occur following physical stimuli. 3 This case differs from that as there were no iden-tifi able triggers.

40|$|We have {{observed}} three cases of {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) complicated by cutaneous ulcerations and <b>acroosteolysis.</b> Although our first patient had a mild case of CTS, he had a concomitant amphetamine addition. This led to a mania for gnawing away at the digits in {{the territory of the}} median nerve. Our other two patients had severe cases of CTS. One suffered from diabetes and the other from primary amyloidosis. Surgical decompression of the median nerve was carried out in these two cases and led to rapid healing of the cutaneous lesions. The latter patients suffered from the entity known in the french literature as carpal tunnel "ulcero-mutilating" (ulcero-osteolytic CTS). This paper discusses possible mechanisms for its pathogenesis. In one of our cases, for example, we were struck by the role played by the patient's behavioral habits whether it be conscious or subconscious in the self-perpetration of the cutaneous and osseous lesions...|$|E
40|$|Cathepsin K is a {{recently}} identified lysosomal cysteine proteinase. It is abundant in osteoclasts, {{where it is}} believed to {{play a vital role}} in the resorption and remodeling of bone. Pycnodysostosis is a rare inherited osteochondrodysplasia that is caused by mutations of the cathepsin-K gene, characterized by osteosclerosis, short stature, and <b>acroosteolysis</b> of the distal phalanges. With a view to delineating the role of cathepsin K in bone resorption, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of this proteinase. Cathepsin-K-deficient mice survive and are fertile, but display an osteopetrotic phenotype with excessive trabeculation of the bone-marrow space. Cathepsin-K-deficient osteoclasts manifested a modified ultrastructural appearance: their resorptive surface was poorly defined with a broad demineralized matrix fringe containing undigested fine collagen fibrils; their ruffled borders lacked crystal-like inclusions, and they were devoid of collagen-fibril-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles. Assaying the resorptive activity of cathepsin-K-deficient osteoclasts in vitro revealed this function to be severely impaired, which supports the contention that cathepsin K is of major importance in bone remodeling...|$|E
40|$|Mandibuloacral {{dysplasia}} (MAD) is a phenotypically heterogeneous, rare {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by mandibular and clavicular hypoplasia, <b>acroosteolysis,</b> delayed closure of cranial sutures, joint contractures, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation. Patients with MAD develop two patterns of lipodystrophy: type A pattern, with loss of sc fat from the extremities and normal or slight excess {{in the neck}} and truncal regions; and type B pattern, with a more generalized loss of sc fat involving the face, trunk, and extremities. Recently, affected patients from five consanguineous Italian pedigrees with partial lipodystrophy (type A) {{were reported to have}} a homozygous R 527 H mutation in LMNA (lamin A/C) gene. We carried out mutational analysis of LMNA in affected patients from six pedigrees. Affected patients from two pedigrees with type A lipodystrophy had the homozygous R 527 H mutation in LMNA. The other four affected subjects who had type B lipodystrophy did not have any mutation in the exons and splice site junctions of LMNA; RNA extracted from lymphoblasts of two of these patients also revealed normal sequence. In these four subjects, sequencing of other known genes implicated in lipodystrophies, i. e. AGPAT 2, Seipin, and PPARG also revealed no substantial alterations. We conclude that MAD is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Besides LMNA gene, other as yet unmapped loci could be linked to MAD. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Context: Hutchinson-Gilford {{progeria}} syndrome (HGPS) and mandibuloacral dysplasia are well-recognized allelic {{autosomal dominant}} and recessive progeroid disorders, respectively, due to mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA) gene. Heterozygous LMNA mutations {{have also been}} reported in {{a small number of}} patients with a less well-characterized atypical progeroid syndrome (APS). Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the underlying genetic and molecular basis of the phenotype of patients presenting with APS. Results: We report 11 patients with APS from nine families, many with novel heterozygous missense LMNA mutations, such as, P 4 R, E 111 K, D 136 H, E 159 K, and C 588 R. These and previously reported patients now reveal a spectrum of clinical features including progeroid manifestations such as short stature, beaked nose, premature graying, partial alopecia, high-pitched voice, skin atrophy over the hands and feet, partial and generalized lipodystrophy with metabolic complications, and skeletal anomalies such as mandibular hypoplasia and mild <b>acroosteolysis.</b> Skin fibroblasts from these patients when assessed for lamin A/C expression using epifluorescence microscopy revealed variable nuclear morphological abnormalities similar to those observed in patients with HGPS. However, these nuclear abnormalities in APS patients could not be rescued with 48 h treatment with farnesyl transferase inhibitors, geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors or trichostatin-A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Immunoblots of cell lysates from fibroblasts did not reveal prelamin A accumulation in any of these patients. Conclusions: APS patients have a few overlapping but some distinct clinical features as compared with HGPS and mandibuloacral dysplasia. The pathogenesis of clinical manifestations in APS patients seems not to be related to accumulation of mutant farnesylated prelamin A...|$|E
40|$|Mandibuloacral {{dysplasia}} type A (MADA; OMIM 248370), a rare disorder {{caused by}} mutation in the LMNA gene, {{is characterized by}} post-natal growth retardation, craniofacial and skeletal anomalies (mandibular and clavicular hypoplasia, <b>acroosteolysis,</b> delayed closure of cranial sutures, low bone mass and joint contractures), cutaneous changes and partial lipodystrophy. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms by which LMNA mutations produce bone alterations. An altered bone extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling could play a pivotal role in this disorder and influence part of the typical bone phenotype observed in patients. Therefore, we have focused our investigation on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are degradative enzymes involved in ECM degradation and ECM remodelling, thus likely contributing to the altered bone mineral density and bone metabolism values seen in five MADA patients. We evaluated the serum levels of several MMPs involved in bone development, remodelling and homeostasis, such as MMP- 9, - 2, - 3, - 8 and - 13, and found that only the 82 kDa active enzyme forms of MMP- 9 are significantly higher in MADA sera compared with healthy controls (n = 16). The serum level of MMP- 3 was instead lower in all patients. No significant differences were observed between controls and MADA patients for the serum levels of MMP- 2, - 8 and - 13 and of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, a natural inhibitor of MMP- 9. Similarly, normal serum levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 1 beta were detected. These data suggest a possible involvement of MMP- 9 in MADA disease, underlying the potential use in diagnosis and therapy...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene {{have been}} {{reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} disorders, including lipodystrophies, cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophies, neuropathy, mandibuloacral dysplasia, restrictive dermopathy, and progeria. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to carry out mutational analysis of LMNA in a patient with a novel syndrome of arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and progeroid features. DESIGN: The study design was a descriptive case report. SETTING: The study was performed at a referral center. PATIENT: A 44 -yr-old male of European descent with an autosomal recessive arthropathy syndrome affecting predominantly the distal femora and proximal tibia in the knee with tendinous calcifications was studied. He also had progeroid features, such as pinched nose and micrognathia, cataract, alopecia, generalized lipodystrophy, and sclerodermatous skin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were mutational analysis of lamin A/C (LMNA) and its processing enzyme, zinc metalloproteinase (ZMPSTE 24), as candidate genes. RESULTS: We found a homozygous nucleotide substitution, 1718 C>T, in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, resulting in substitution of a well-conserved residue serine at position 573 with leucine (S 573 L). This missense mutation only affects lamin A, not lamin C, because the alternative splicing site is located in exon 10. Immunofluorescence staining of the nuclei from his skin fibroblasts showed occasional misshapen morphology. CONCLUSIONS: The S 573 L homozygous LMNA mutation is associated with a novel phenotype of arthropathy, tendinous calcifications, and progeroid features distinct from the <b>acroosteolysis</b> previously reported in patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia caused by LMNA or ZMPSTE 24 mutations. Thus, arthropathy with tendinous calcifications can be added to the growing list of disorders associated with LMNA mutations. status: publishe...|$|E
