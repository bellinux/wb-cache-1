At the summit there are frequently alpine choughs, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the hazel dormouse. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, rock ptarmigan, <b>snow</b> <b>finch,</b> alpine accentor and brambling. The crag martin which has given {{its name to the}} Schwalbenwand ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered.

40|$|Background: A disintegrin and {{metalloprotease}} 12 <b>s</b> (<b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s)</b> is {{a potential}} first trimester serum marker for fetal trisomy and adverse pregnancy outcome in singletons. In this study, <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> levels in first trimester serum of uncomplicated and complicated twins were evaluated. Methods: <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> was studied in maternal serum of 215 twin pregnancies, collected between 2004 and 2008. <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> was measured 'blind to outcome' using AutoDelfia (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). As a reference, data from 2423 singletons were used. Results: The median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> level was increased in euploid twins [1. 61 multiples of the median (MoM); n = 209] compared with singletons. The median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM was significantly lower in monochorionic (1. 36 MoM; n = 41) compared with dichorionic twins (1. 67 MoM; n = 168) (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0. 005). Trisomy 21 was identified in two pregnancies. Median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM in twins complicated by hypertensive disorders (1. 77 MoM, n = 35) or small for gestational age fetus (1. 54 MoM; n = 24) was {{not significantly different from}} uncomplicated twins (1. 64 MoM; n = 134). Conclusion: Median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM in euploid twins was increased compared with singletons. Monochorionic had significantly lower median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoM than dichorionic twins. Median <b>ADAM</b> 12 <b>s</b> MoMs were not significantly different in twins complicated by hypertensive disorders or small for gestational age fetus compared with uncomplicated twins.

50|$|The alpine pika (Ochotona alpina) is {{a species}} of mammal in the pika family, Ochotonidae. It is found in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia in very cold, mountainous regions. It is a small mammal only {{weighing}} about 5 oz and about 7 in long. They have no visible tail, round ears, and sharp claws used for foraging and digging. They feed mainly on plant stems, which they gather during the summer for the winter months to create haypiles. This storage will sometimes be shared with other species such as reindeer. They {{have been known to}} share their burrows with <b>snow</b> <b>finches,</b> as they will help them build their nest. They are sometimes referred to as the whistling hare because of their rabbit-like behavior and high-pitched warning calls.|$|R

However, there are important differences. The density profile of the liquid in the Fe 3 <b>S</b> <b>snow</b> region is unstable. The sinking and remelting of Fe 3 S results in an increase in S with increasing depth, which results in turn in a decreasing density with depth. In the Fe 3 <b>S</b> <b>snow</b> region, therefore, the material continuously crystallizes and remelts because of this unstable situation. Below the snow zone, compositional convection is absent, since the remelting of Fe 3 S results in a local increase of S and leads to the formation of a lower density fluid layer on top of the denser liquid core below. This situation is stable. However, thermally driven convection in the bottom fluid layer may still be possible, since the heat flow from the lower core is adiabatic owing to the convective snow zone. Over time, the Fe 3 <b>S</b> <b>snow</b> region comprises the entire core and a solid inner Fe 3 S core forms. For this crystallization scenario, we can find two convection layers and, therefore, two dynamo regions if thermally driven convection is efficient in the liquid inner core. Alternatively, the dynamo region is located in the upper core, attains its maximum extent when the snow zone reaches the center, and then shrinks again owing to the growth of the solid inner core.|$|R
