5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut because he could not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss of their car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department <b>at</b> <b>Sears.</b> When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E
25|$|He began {{racing in}} the road course circuits, running in the SCCA and IMSA series. He made his IMSA debut in 1989 <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point International Raceway, {{qualifying}} ninth and finishing 12th in a Chevrolet Camaro. He also picked up a victory that year in an endurance race <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point. In 1990, he began running the SCCA, running an unsponsored Oldsmobile Cutlass for Rocketsports at Portland, and one race for Tom Gloy at Mid-Ohio. He did not race professionally again until 1996, running SCCA events at Watkins Glen, Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, Sears Point, and Reno, Nevada. He competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1998 and 1999, finishing fifth and tenth, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Hubert {{made his}} first Winston Cup race in his first attempt with Jim Wilson's #78 team <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point during the 1997 season. He would bring the #78 Hanes / Diamond Rio Ford home in the 28th position, one lap down. His next start would come in 1998 with the #19 team owned by Kurt Roehrig. He {{qualified}} an impressive 10th in his second race <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point, however the #19 Bradford White Ford would finish 41st after a transmission failure 78 laps into the race. His second start during the 1998 season would come at Watkins Glen with Dan Marino and Bill Elliott's #13 team. Hubert drove the #13 FirstPlus Financial Ford to a 36th-place finish. He would return to Roehrig's team in 1999 for three races. His first start would come at Las Vegas where he qualified fourth, finishing in the 28th position. Again, Hubert raced <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point where he would finish in the 33rd position, one lap down. He also attempted the Pepsi 400 at Michigan, however {{he was unable to}} qualify. In 2000, he would make one start with Penske Racing and the #12 Mobil 1 Ford. He would finish the Global Crossing @ The Glen in 33rd place after starting 16th. In 2001, Hubert qualified Buckshot Jones' #44 Georgia Pacific Dodge for the Dodge/Save Mart 350. In 2002, he would race the Sirius Satellite Radio at the Glen for Bill Davis Racing. Hubert finished the #23 Hills Brothers Coffee Dodge in the 24th position after starting 40th. He would return to the series in 2004 with Kirk Shelmerdine Racing, driving each of the road courses. At the newly renamed Infineon Raceway (formerly Sears Point Raceway) he would finish 43rd in the #72 Freddie B's Ford after running five laps at too slow of a pace for NASCAR. The Watkins Glen would be much better for Hubert as he would finish in the 29th position just one lap down. He would return to Shelmerdine's team for 2005 and attempt each of the road courses. He would make the race at Infineon, however he finished 43rd after oil pressure problems. Hubert would not make the Sirius at The Glen after qualifying was rained out. Hubert again raced for Shelmerdine in 2006 for the Dodge/Save Mart 350, but was swept up in a crash on the opening lap and once more finished last.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Moore chose Morgan Shepherd {{to be his}} new driver. Shepherd had {{a strong}} year, winning the Atlanta Journal 500 and {{finishing}} a career-best fifth in points. When Shepherd dropped seven points in the standings in 1991, he left for Wood Brothers Racing, and Moore selected Geoff Bodine, older brother of Moore's former driver Brett, to be his new pilot. Despite two wins and eleven top-ten finishes, Bodine finished just 16th in points. Bodine won Moore's last race in 1993 <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point, {{which was one of}} Bodine's last races for the team as he purchased the late Alan Kulwicki's AK Racing and was going to become an owner-driver. Lake Speed took over for him, and his best finish was an 11th at the Mello Yello 500.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Gordon and {{his family}} had to {{overcome}} an insurance hurdle. The minimum age for driving the sprint cars was 16, and his persistence paid off with an all Florida speed weeks. Supporting his career choice, Gordon's family moved from Vallejo, California, to Pittsboro, Indiana, where there were more opportunities for younger racers. Before the age of 18, Gordon had already won three short-track races and was awarded USAC Midget Car Racing Rookie of the Year in 1989. That season was highlighted by winning Night Before the 500 midget car race on the day before the Indianapolis 500. During the decade, Gordon also ran sprint cars in Australia and New Zealand. In 1990, Gordon won his second consecutive Night Before the 500, the Hut Hundred, and the Belleville Midget Nationals on his way to winning the USAC national Midget title. In 1991, Gordon captured the USAC Silver Crown, and at the age of 20 became the youngest driver to win the season championship. He also won the 4 Crown Nationals midget car race that season. In his midget car career between 1989 and 1992, he finished in the Top 3 in 22 of 40 USAC midget car events. In 1992, Gordon competed in the Slim Jim All Pro Series' Winchester 400, but finished 24th after crashing on lap 172. The following year, he ran a Featherlite Southwest Tour race <b>at</b> <b>Sears</b> Point Raceway, finishing 29th after suffering an engine failure.|$|E

In 1999, he would compete in three races for Conley Racing and one race for Marty Walsh's #81 team. He had a wild ride during the 100th race in Craftsman Truck series history at Evergreen when he spun after contact from behind by David Starr through an opening in the inside wall and went into the infield. Amazingly, he didn't hit anything, but when he brought it into the pits seconds later, his brakes failed and his truck caught fire, sending him out. His best finish during the season, 17th, would come in the #7 Conely Racing Engines Chevrolet at Phoenix. He has yet to return to the Craftsman Truck Series since the 1999 season.|$|E

500|$|Kaiser, Allstate, Frazer and the economy/compact Henry J {{product lines}} all ceased {{production}} {{before the end}} of the 1955 model year run, partly owing to their failure to produce and market a viable V8 engine in a marketplace increasingly focused on the clout (and horsepower) associated with a V8 power plant. In particular, the Henry J (named after Henry J Kaiser sold an initially strong 82,000 units with its 68hp, inline-four power plant and optional 80hp inline-six, but starting at $1363, the consumer could buy a full-sized Chevrolet auto with an inline-6 for only $200 more than the Henry J inline-4, making it economically unappealing, and all three lines underpowered when compared to the offerings of the Big Three.
