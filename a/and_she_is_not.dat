5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E

500|$|Diana {{arrives in}} Erinsborough from New York, on a {{business}} trip and she decides that she wants to try {{to take control of the}} company. Diana clashes with a lot of the other Erinsborough residents <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well liked because she is abrupt and does not hide her ambition to bring people down. Diana can be very charming and this hides the fact that she is looking after herself and her interests. Of this, Badler said [...] "She is the smiling assassin, but she's irresistible as she has the wit, the brain and the moves to get away with it!" [...] To go with her job and personality, Diana has a glamorous wardrobe, which Badler said is the complete opposite of hers. Badler explained that Diana is more conservative as she wears a lot of beige, silver and grey, with Cartier watches. She added [...] "There are many power suits and stilettos!" ...|$|E

Diana wants to get to the top, but Paul stands in her way as his place within the company is secure. However, Diana discovers that Paul has been embezzling money and uses this to get what she wants. Diana clashes with a lot of the other Erinsborough residents <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well liked. She is described as a [...] "villainess", a [...] "dangerous femme fatale" [...] and a woman on a mission. Diana sleeps with Paul, despite the fact that he is married and she becomes a suspect following an attempt on his life. Badler and Diana were well received by critics.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Ladenson {{thought the}} {{character}} of Pussy Galore to be [...] "perhaps the most memorable figure in the Bond periphery." [...] Galore was introduced by Fleming in order for Bond to seduce her, thereby proving Bond's masculinity {{of being able to}} seduce a lesbian. To some extent the situation also reflected Fleming's own opinions, expressed in the novel as part of Bond's thoughts, where [...] "her sexual confusion is attributable to women's suffrage"; in addition, as Fleming himself put it in the book: [...] "Bond felt the sexual challenge all beautiful Lesbians have for men." [...] Ladenson points out that, unlike some Bond girls, Galore's role in the plot is crucial <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just there as an accessory: it is her change of heart that allows good to triumph over evil. In doing so, [...] "Goldfinger himself...is a mere obstacle, the dragon to be got rid of before the worthy knight can make off with the duly conquered lady." ...|$|E

[...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first to}} offer a {{solution}} was the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James, written about 150 AD. The original gospels never refer to Joseph's age, but the author presents him as an old man chosen by lot (i.e., by God) to watch over the Virgin. Jesus' brothers are presented as Joseph's children by an earlier marriage, and his years and righteousness explain why {{he has not yet}} had sex with his wife: [...] "I received her by lot as my wife, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet my wife, but she has conceived by the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song's lyrics {{speak of}} the female protagonist {{realising}} that {{her relationship with her}} man is over <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> going to return to what used to be. A demo version of [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] with lead vocals from Timbaland and Keri Hilson leaked in 2010. Then in early January 2011, a second demo version with an altered production, different lyrics and uncredited female vocals also leaked. This was followed by a third unfinished version, this time with Scherzinger's vocals, before the final version premiered on January 14, 2011.|$|E

In court protocol she is referred to by the sobriquet [...] "Rumpare Malin": {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "Rumpare" [...] is unknown, but it is similar to the term [...] "Rumpoxe", which was a contemporary pejorative used for [...] "stupid" [...] people.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, Meyer's adult sci-fi novel The Host, was {{released}} by the adult division of Little, Brown and Company. It follows the story of Melanie Stryder and Wanderer, a young woman and an invading alien [...] "soul," [...] who are forced to work as one. The Host debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for 26 weeks. Meyer has said that she is working on additional books in The Host series and that she intends to write a trilogy, with {{the second and third}} books being called [...] "The Soul" [...] and [...] "The Seeker", respectively. In a Q session in Kansas City, Meyer stated that she has outlines for the sequels and has done some writing on them, but she has some qualms since The Host universe is a [...] "dangerous place" [...] where characters might die, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sure if she wants to kill them off.|$|E

He has come to the big city looking for a good time, hopefully among the [...] "white shoulders" [...] of the fair damsels of the Big Apple. Upon meeting Norma, he falls head over heels for her and proposes on their first evening together. [...] Norma is reluctant to agree, for she is not a gold-digger, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in love with Kent. But she has no prospects, and she feels that she may come to love him in time, so she agrees, and the two are immediately married.|$|E
2500|$|Samantha Womack {{admitted}} that she thought the plot was [...] "implausible". She commented: [...] "I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one," [...] she told the Daily Mirror. [...] "But Ronnie is a soap character <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses {{are trying to get}} high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it." [...] On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented [...] "in an offensive manner" [...] because it [...] "appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: [...] "Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world." ...|$|E
