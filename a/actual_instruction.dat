The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.|$|E

It was true that they all lived and fed together in the auberges of their respective langues, and that they possessed no houses or establishments of their own; but the magnificence of their armour and attire, and the lavish expenditure of some upon their pleasures, contrasted strangely with the poverty to which they had vowed themselves. It was true that in many cases the means to support the expenditure was derived from the shares the knights received of the plunder acquired in their captures of Moslem ships; but undoubtedly many must have possessed large private means; the bailiffs, for example, although only required by the rules to place before the knights at their auberges the rations they received for them, with such luxuries as could be purchased by their yearly allowance for that purpose, expended annually very large sums in addition, and supplied their tables with every dainty, in order to gain popularity and goodwill among the members of the langue.|$|E

The processor front-end accuracy and bandwidth are limited by instruction cache misses, multi-cycle instruction cache accesses, and target or direction mispredictions for control-flow operations. This paper introduces a block-aware ISA (BLISS) that helps accurate instruction delivery by defining basic block descriptors in addition to and separate from the <b>actual</b> <b>instructions</b> in a program. We show that BLISS allows for a decoupled front-end that tolerates cache latency and allows for higher speculation accuracy. This translates to a 20 % IPC and 14 % energy improvements over conventional front-ends. We also demonstrate that a BLISS-based front-end outperforms by 13 % decoupled front-ends that detect fetched blocks dynamically in hardware, without any information from the ISA. ...|$|R
