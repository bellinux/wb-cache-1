5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. <b>All</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the 1st and 5th Kentucky Rifle Regiments and the 1st Volunteers {{continued}} to hold out in Frenchtown. Losing 5 killed and 40 wounded, they had succeeded in taking a heavy toll on the British artillery. Their marksmen had kill or wounded all but {{one member of the}} gun crews manning the three cannon {{in the center of the}} British line, plus 13 of the 16-man howitzer crew. They had also brought down many infantrymen. Now, however, they were finally running out of ammunition, having repulsed three British assaults. Gen. Proctor demanded Winchester order his remaining men to surrender. Otherwise, <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> killed and Frenchtown burned. Procter insisted on an unconditional surrender and refused Winchester's counter-proposals, since Winchester was already his prisoner. Major George Madison, a United States officer still on the battlefield, persuaded Procter to accept a surrender on the promise that <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> protected as prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{different}} intermediate- and high-level radioactive wastes, coming from national programmes {{to develop nuclear weapons}} and nuclear power. It is a national responsibility to pay for the management of these. In addition, new nuclear power stations could be built, the waste management from which would be the private sector's financial responsibility, although <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> stored in a single facility. Most of the UK's higher-activity radioactive waste is currently held in temporary storage at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|During the off-season, English {{attended}} Boston University {{evenings and}} Saturdays to attain her degree. But combining baseball with {{going to college}} nights took her nine years to graduate. Nevertheless, playing professional baseball did help to pay her college expenses. Before the 1951 season, when the team moved from Racine, Wisconsin to Battle Creek, Michigan, English and some original Belles members were disappointment and decided {{not to make the}} move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home. English and teammates thought that <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> different, like a new team, maybe a new manager and, specially, a new location.|$|E

25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway opened officially on July 4, 1893. Folks amassed {{themselves}} at the remote Mountain Junction. Up to this point {{there was only one}} means of public transportation from the valleys below to the hillside community of Altadena. It was the Los Angeles Terminal Railway which by this time was running from Terminal Island in San Pedro to Mountain Junction. The trains ran twice a day and, at that, very irregularly, so the only sure means of getting to Altadena on time was by your own horse and buggy. This lack of transportation coupled with Lowe’s inability to establish any at <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in part the downfall of the railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{lockdown}} {{resulted in}} a heated debate about section 44. The section was raised {{as an example of}} the junta's illegitimacy and unjust means, by the temple and many other critics. While proponents pointed out that <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> finished if Luang Por Dhammajayo only gave himself over to acknowledge the charges, critics pointed out that Luang Por Dhammajayo would be imprisoned and defrocked if brought into custody. News reporters compared the temple's resistance with the Burmese Saffron Revolution in 2007, some reporters expecting defeat soon, others a new opposition movement. Many reporters have also questioned the practicality of using section 44 and many resources to arrest one person for acknowledging a charge of a non-violent crime. It has been pointed out that it is more viable to try Luang Por Dhammajayo in absentia to determine guilt first.|$|E
25|$|Ancient rowing {{was done}} in a fixed seated position, the most {{effective}} rowing position, with rowers facing the stern. A sliding stroke, which provided the strength from both legs {{as well as the}} arms, was suggested by earlier historians, but no conclusive evidence has supported it. Practical experiments with the full-scale reconstruction Olympias has shown that there was insufficient space, while moving or rolling seats would have been highly impractical to construct with ancient methods. Rowers in ancient war galleys sat below the upper deck with little view of their surroundings. The rowing was therefore managed by supervisors, and coordinated with pipes or rhythmic chanting. Galleys were highly maneuverable, able to turn on their axis or even to row backwards, though it required a skilled and experienced crew. In galleys with an arrangement of three men per oar, <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seated, but the rower furthest inboard would perform a stand-and-sit stroke, getting up on his feet to push the oar forwards and then sitting down again to pull it back.|$|E

According to i-D, {{with a couple of}} exceptions, the songs of Debut fell into two types: [...] "those where Björk addressed the listener as someone in pain and told them fireworks would light their nights and <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> well;" [...] and [...] "songs where she sang about her own pain." [...] The Face stated that the album's lyrics [...] " [...] her love affair with language," [...] while The Sunday Times felt that Björk [...] "rigorously [...] the obvious" [...] by using lyrics that do not rhyme.|$|E
500|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, implemented to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower due to wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were scrapped entirely. The wealth and age requirements were removed after which anyone could join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equipped as milites, with the same, state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry. [...] Sallust, in his Jugurthine War, describes several instances in which Roman or allied regular heavy infantry were equipped with light equipment and used as light footsoldiers. This was supposedly a common practice.|$|E

500|$|The ship {{spent most}} of April and May 1913 {{undergoing}} repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, {{to act as a}} supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. [...] "Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote.|$|E
500|$|Soon after departing the Desbrosses Street Pier {{on its way}} to Albany in {{the morning}} fog of 1 June 1926, Washington Irving was struck, a little after 9:00am, by one of two oil barges being pushed by the tug boat Thomas E. Moran. [...] The {{collision}} damaged Washington Irvings starboard side below the water line just aft of amidships, allowing water to rush into the engine rooms. The collision resulted in a hole measuring [...] long and [...] wide. The Captain, David H. Deming, ordered all passengers to put on life preservers and whistled the [...] "Ship's afire" [...] signal of two long and three short blasts repeatedly. A chaos of shouts prevailed as the passengers tried to don life vests and locate their children in the fog. An inability to see any land increased the alarm of the passengers despite the Captain's shouts that <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safe and he ordered the jazz band to resume playing their music and maintain their post until rescue.|$|E
500|$|The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was {{established}} by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the [...] "Bicentennial"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976. A total of 15 million sets (45 million) coins in <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> struck in silver clad for sale {{to the public at}} a premium.|$|E

When The Beatles hit America, they changed the {{paradigm}} of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with {{an emphasis on the}} female." [...] Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, asserted that [...] "Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow... She certainly raised the standards of all of them... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers." [...] According to Fouz-Hernández, subsequent female singers such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, and Pink were like her [...] "daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her." [...] Madonna has also influenced male artists, inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2011 Kerrang! interview, Lee {{said that}} the album would be self-titled and was [...] "about the band; it's more of a band record."

[...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, it was just the only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love with this thing in a major way." [...] In an MTV News interview, she said that 16 songs had been recorded but not <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> included on the album.

[...] In a letter to Nancy, Ronald wrote, [...] "whatever I treasure and enjoy... <b>all</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> without meaning if I didn't have you."
