5|$|Argon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is a noble gas. Argon is the third-most <b>abundant</b> gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It {{is more than twice}} as <b>abundant</b> as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as <b>abundant</b> as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as <b>abundant</b> as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most <b>abundant</b> noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is one of}} {{the nine}} least <b>abundant</b> stable {{elements}} in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more <b>abundant,</b> platinum is 10 times more <b>abundant,</b> and silver and mercury are 80 times more <b>abundant.</b> Tellurium is about as <b>abundant</b> as iridium. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5ppm or more. The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic ("iron-loving") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as <b>abundant</b> as zinc and more <b>abundant</b> than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more <b>abundant</b> than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less <b>abundant</b> than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|After the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, biodiversity required substantial time to recover, {{despite the}} existence of <b>abundant</b> vacant ecological niches.|$|E
5|$|Bald Hill – Mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is <b>abundant</b> in this area.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} reactivity, all {{chlorine}} in the Earth's crust {{is in the}} form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt. It is the second-most <b>abundant</b> halogen (after fluorine) and twenty-first most <b>abundant</b> chemical element in Earth's crust. These crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less <b>abundant</b> in the crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per {{million of the}} Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most <b>abundant</b> element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more <b>abundant</b> in the oceans, resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is the 15th most <b>abundant</b> {{element in}} the Earth's crust, and the fourth most <b>abundant</b> {{element in the}} {{universe}} by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It is the second most <b>abundant</b> element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most <b>abundant</b> {{chemical}} element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is <b>abundant</b> in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} thought that models {{must be more}} <b>abundant</b> than mimics, {{but this is not}} always so.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). The main features of the climate are high temperatures and <b>abundant</b> rainfall throughout the year; this <b>abundant</b> rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} dysprosium {{is composed}} of seven isotopes: 156Dy, 158Dy, 160Dy, 161Dy, 162Dy, 163Dy, and 164Dy. These are all considered stable, although 156Dy decays by alpha decay with a half-life of over 1×1018years. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, 164Dy is the most <b>abundant</b> at 28%, followed by 162Dy at 26%. The least <b>abundant</b> is 156Dy at 0.06%.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, thorium is {{much more}} abundant: with an {{abundance}} of 8.1parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust, {{it is one of the}} most <b>abundant</b> of the heavy elements, almost as <b>abundant</b> as lead (13ppm) and more <b>abundant</b> than tin (2.1ppm). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a lithophile. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the elements as the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most <b>abundant</b> {{element in}} the Earth's crust, roughly as <b>abundant</b> as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs {{naturally}} in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very <b>abundant</b> in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most <b>abundant</b> element overall and the most <b>abundant</b> alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most <b>abundant</b> element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} <b>abundant</b> but less diverse in {{temperate}} waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more <b>abundant</b> in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are <b>abundant</b> and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} is {{bordered by}} large swamps and wet meadows, and has <b>abundant</b> plants and shellfish.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimens}} recovered {{are most}} common in near-shore environments; however, they are never <b>abundant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The table gives crustal abundances of the {{elements}} commonly to rarely recognised as metalloids. Some other elements are included for comparison: oxygen and xenon (the most and least <b>abundant</b> elements with stable isotopes); iron and the coinage metals copper, silver and gold; and rhenium, the least <b>abundant</b> stable metal (aluminium is normally the most <b>abundant</b> metal). Various abundance estimates have been published; these often disagree to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is more <b>abundant</b> than uranium and can satisfy world energy {{demands for}} longer.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is the ninth-most <b>abundant</b> {{element in}} Earth's crust (0.63% by mass) and the seventh-most <b>abundant</b> metal. It is present as oxides in most igneous rocks, in sediments derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water. Of the 801 types of igneous rocks {{analyzed}} by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.|$|E
5|$|Various macroinvertebrate taxa inhabit Roaring Creek. At one site, {{there is}} one <b>abundant</b> macroinvertebrate taxon, with 25 to 100 {{individuals}} being observed. At this site, there are five common taxa and five present taxa, with 10 to 25 and 3 to 9 individuals being observed, respectively. Eleven taxa are rare, with fewer than three individuals being observed. At another site, there are two <b>abundant</b> taxa, three common taxa, four present taxa, and eight rare taxa. At a third site on the creek, there are three <b>abundant</b> taxa, four common taxa, three present taxa, and seven rare taxa.|$|E
5|$|Adam Yates (2004) {{described}} a single sauropod tail vertebra from the Upper Elliot Formation of South Africa that may {{belong to a}} genus closely related to Vulcanodon. The Upper Elliot Formation {{is famous for its}} <b>abundant</b> fossils of the prosauropod Massospondylus.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines, this widespread and <b>abundant</b> species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Although more <b>abundant</b> in montane and {{northern}} coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less <b>abundant</b> in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|Although osmium {{is one of}} the even-numbered {{elements}}, {{which puts}} it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space, osmium is the least <b>abundant</b> stable element in Earth's crust with an average mass fraction of 50parts per trillion in the continental crust.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts <b>abundant</b> populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less <b>abundant</b> in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more <b>abundant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{members of the}} Mecoptera are the Nannochoristidae of Upper Permian age. Fossil Mecoptera become <b>abundant</b> and diverse during the Cretaceous, for example in China, where panorpids such as Jurassipanorpa, hangingflies (Bittacidae and Cimbrophlebiidae), Orthophlebiidae, and Cimbrophlebiidae have been found.|$|E
5|$|Animals form another {{important}} part of the house sparrow's diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, dipteran flies, and aphids are especially important. Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. Young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching. They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In most places, grasshoppers and crickets are the most <b>abundant</b> foods of nestlings. True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are <b>abundant</b> to feed their young. House sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.|$|E
5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, {{the site of the}} Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and <b>abundant</b> wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an <b>abundant</b> and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.|$|E
5|$|Aspartate, glycine, and {{glutamine}} are precursors of nucleotides. However, {{not all of}} {{the functions}} of other <b>abundant</b> non-standard amino acids are known.|$|E
5|$|Attractions on {{the island}} include Achamore Gardens and the <b>abundant</b> wildlife, {{especially}} seabirds. There have been numerous shipwrecks on the surrounding rocks and skerries.|$|E
5|$|Because {{species of}} aetosaurs {{typically}} have restricted fossil ranges and are <b>abundant</b> in the strata {{they are found}} in, they are useful in biochronology. Osteoderms {{are the most common}} remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single identifiable scute can accurately date the layer it is found in.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most <b>abundant</b> element in Earth's crust and the third most <b>abundant</b> metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most <b>abundant</b> element {{in the human body}} and the most <b>abundant</b> metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the {{physiology}} and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} {{is found}} in Eucalyptus woodland, most commonly of wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) or salmon gum (E. salmonophloia). It is also found nearby pine plantations and sandplains or kwongan heath with <b>abundant</b> Hakea, Banksia, and Grevillea shrubs.|$|E
