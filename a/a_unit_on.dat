The championship was held by all {{three members of the}} Kru, until January 28, 2004, when they were defeated by Kevin Northcutt and Legend in Nashville. After several abortive attempts to regain the tag title, the Kru began supporting Ron Killings's bid to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The Kru later feuded with Jarrett's mercenaries, The Elite Guard (Chad Collyer, Hotstuff Hernandez and Onyx).|$|E

He took a machine gun and opened fire on German troops. Together with his platoon, he {{was among the first to}} break into the German defenses. During this action, Otmakhov reportedly killed up to 10 German soldiers. For this action, he was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 7 July.|$|E

The original background trimming was also a contribution of William P. Yarborough.|$|E

Many Jewish communities, especially those which identify with religious Zionism, recite Hallel on Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day) and some also recite it on Yom Yerushalayim (the day commemorating the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967). On those occasions, Hallel is usually chanted aloud as part of Shacharit (the morning prayer service) following the Shacharit's Shemoneh Esreh ("The Eighteen", the main prayer).|$|E

6000|$|It {{was rough}} on Gilson. Such was the terse, cold, but not {{altogether}} unsympathetic {{judgment of the}} better public opinion at Mammon Hill--the dictum of respectability. The verdict of the opposite, or rather the opposing, element--the element that lurked red-eyed and restless about Moll Gurney's [...] "deadfall," [...] while respectability took it with sugar at Mr. Jo. Bentley's gorgeous [...] "saloon"--was to {{pretty much the same}} general effect, though somewhat more ornately expressed by the use of picturesque expletives, which it is needless to quote. Virtually, Mammon Hill was <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>on</b> the Gilson question. And it must be confessed that in a merely temporal sense all was not well with Mr. Gilson. He had that morning been led into town by Mr. Brentshaw and publicly charged with horse stealing; the sheriff meantime busying himself about The Tree with a new manila rope and Carpenter Pete being actively employed between drinks upon a pine box about the length and breadth of Mr. Gilson. Society having rendered its verdict, there remained between Gilson and eternity only the decent formality of a trial.|$|E
