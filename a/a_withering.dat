5|$|Grey's troops marched {{around the}} head of the Acushnet River and camped on the eastern banks. The {{following}} day, they embarked on their boats, but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia were beginning to arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly colonel who was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> volley of musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to their boats.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of October 21/22, the large {{artillery}} forces the Egyptians had concentrated began harassing the Israelis. The Egyptians had identified command posts and tank concentration areas for attack, especially at Serabaeum and Ain Ghasin, as well likely routes of attack, and continued to provide <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> fire support during the Israeli attack. At morning, Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions, concentrating on Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa, Nefisha, and al-Galaa' base, and at noon they destroyed the Abu Gamoos Bridge at Ismailia. At this time, company-sized units of armor and infantry advanced against the Upper Bridge and the bridges at Nefisha but were repelled by Sagger missiles.|$|E
25|$|Platoon Sergeant Walton {{was serving}} in a {{parachute}} battalion {{as part of}} the 1st Marine Division (Reinforced) that was selected to land in the Solomons in August 1942. Companies A and B of that battalion landed on the island of Gavutu on the morning of August 7, 1942.

Within 10 minutes, the Foreign Arms Corps had suffered 50% casualties, and Ward himself was shot in the left jaw, with an exit wound in the right cheek, scarring him for life and leaving him with a speech impediment.|$|E

25|$|The tumens would {{typically}} {{advance on}} a broad front, five lines deep. The first three lines would be composed of horse archers, the last two of lancers. Once an enemy force was located, the Mongols would try to avoid risky or reckless frontal assaults (in sharp contrast to their European and Middle-Eastern opponents). Instead they would use diversionary attacks to fix the enemy in place, while their main forces sought to outflank or surround the foe. First the horse archers would lay down <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> barrage of arrow fire. Additional arrows were carried by camels who followed close by, ensuring a plentiful supply of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Treasury {{was nearly}} out {{of gold in}} 1895, at {{the depths of the}} Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal {{government}} to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.|$|E
25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E

500|$|In her {{analysis}} of Miller's fiction, Rose Secrest connects this theme directly {{to one of}} Miller's earlier short fiction works, quoting a passage from [...] "The Ties that Bind", published in the May 1954 edition of If magazine: [...] "All societies go through three phases.... First there is the struggle to integrate in a hostile environment. Then, after integration, comes an explosive expansion of the culture-conquest.... Then <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> of the mother culture, and the rebellious rise of young cultures." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} scholar Peter Anthony Niessa, the two important components of machismo are aggressive behaviour and hyper-sexuality. Aggressive behaviour [...] is exhibited by displays {{of power and}} strength, while hyper-sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many partners as possible. [...] These two components shape the portrayal of Trujillo and his regime in The Feast of the Goat. As Lorenzo observes, Vargas Llosa [...] "reveals traditions of machismo, of abusive fathers, and of child-rearing practices that repeat the shaming of children, so that each generation bequeaths <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> of the soul to the subsequent one." ...|$|E
500|$|Early was {{similarly}} unprepared when he ordered Harry T. Hays' and Isaac E. Avery's Brigades {{to attack the}} Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill. [...] Once started, fighting was fierce: Col. Andrew L. Harris of the Union 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> attack, losing half his men. Avery was wounded early on, but the Confederates reached {{the crest of the}} hill and entered the Union breastworks, capturing one or two batteries. Seeing he was not supported on his right, Hays withdrew. His right was to be supported by Robert E. Rodes' Division, but Rodes—like Early and Johnson—had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack. He had twice as far to travel as Early; by the time he came in contact with the Union skirmish line, Early's troops had already begun to withdraw.|$|E

500|$|... "Do I Disappoint You", the album's opener, [...] "sees [...] present <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> {{defense of}} his own human frailties, while one orchestral {{battalion}} after another mount their attacks and Martha Wainwright summons 'CHAOS!' and 'DESTRUCTION!' like a marauding Fury". [...] "Going to a Town", the album's lead single, was considered by Uncuts John Mulvey {{to be among the}} angriest lyrics Wainwright has written, an [...] "indictment of the country of his birth that hinges on the refrain, 'I'm so tired of you America'". The political track, which Wainwright claimed he wrote in just five minutes {{on the eve of his}} departure for Berlin, confronts the Bush administration's perceived damage to the U.S. in the form of a love song. It was his discontent with America at the time that lead Wainwright to spend some time recording the album in Berlin. [...] "Tiergarten", named after a large park in Berlin of the same name, is a song about Wainwright's German boyfriend, Jörn Weisbrodt. While recording parts of Release the Stars in Berlin, the couple visited the park often.|$|E
500|$|Workman vigorously defended her Pinnacle Peak {{altitude}} record {{against all}} other claimants, especially Annie Smith Peck. In 1908, Peck claimed {{a new record}} with her climb of Peru's Huascarán, which she believed to be [...] However, she was misinformed as to the peak's height and exaggerated distances she could not measure. Workman was so competitive that she paid a team of French surveyors from the Service Géographique de l'Armée US$13,000 to measure the elevation of the mountain, which was actually , confirming her record. Pauly explains, [...] "Ironically, her determination to prove herself the equal of any man at lofty elevations culminated with <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> attack on an American woman who tried to surpass her". Determined {{to be the best}} woman, Workman was also a meticulous record-keeper so that she could prove her accomplishments. [...] Pauly concludes, [...] "If Fanny Workman ever receives the recognition she deserves for her feminist determination to excel at this then-male sport, she will surely be remembered as much for her insistence upon accurate record-keeping as for the elevations she achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{obtained}} LORAN fixes on Hambleton's position. Coast Guard Lt. Commander Jay Crowe, {{an exchange}} pilot on assignment to the 37th ARRS at Da Nang, was piloting Jolly Green 65.

Their rounds tore through the aircraft, destroying the instrument panel. Crowe struggled to get the aircraft out of the fire zone, and with his instruments shot up, he {{had to rely on}} external visual cues to fly the aircraft. He nursed the helicopter south and was able to get to the Phu Bai airfield. Jolly Green 66 flown by Lt. Colonel Bill Harris followed, only to break through the low ceiling to face ten North Vietnamese tanks and <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> onslaught of ground fire. He fought the controls to bring his rescue helicopter within [...] of Hambleton, his gunners firing the airship's three GAU-2/A 7.62mm (.308 in) six-barreled miniguns, engaging the North Vietnamese on every side.

Stokes {{described}} it as [...] "the antithesis of [...] bright, ringing, optimistic, inspirational selves, it was dirty, loud, discordant, repetitive, noisy, black. If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad, then it was effective". Graham said [...] "'Exit' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the nice guys of rock.

In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond argued it was [...] "awkward enough to remind you that not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Strong led a {{sweep up}} the river and met with no {{resistance}} while a squad of trackers including Tourle moved south, towards Kariba. This latter group spotted the 10 insurgents in ambush in another gully at 13:30 on 19 July and a fierce battle ensued. The RLI squad leader's faulty radio set meant that {{he was unable to}} issue orders, leading Tourle to take the initiative by shouting orders to soldiers around him. This made him the subject of concentrated ZIPRA fire, but he nevertheless directed the RLI actions throughout the contact while also accounting for most of the opposing force personally. [...] "Tourle," [...] says Binda, [...] "armed with an MAG, moved with one other man to a rocky outcrop overlooking the enemy position and laid down <b>a</b> <b>withering</b> fire." [...] Under this cover Corporals Johnstone and Strydom flanked right and eliminated a ZIPRA sniper, while Corporal Kirkwood and Lance-Corporal Coom moved to the left. A sweep was then carried out, during which a guerrilla jumped out of cover and opened fire, wounding Coom; Johnstone killed the insurgent. The remainder of the search revealed the other nine cadres dead, six having been killed by Tourle. The remaining seven cadres were captured or killed {{over the course of the}} next week, leaving none unaccounted for when the operation ended at 12:00 on 26 July 1968.|$|E

[...] General Fraser took stock of the situation, and decided to send a detachment around to flank the American left, at the risk of exposing his own left, which he hoped would hold until Riedesel arrived. [...] Riedesel reached the top of another hill, where he observed that the American line, now including parts of Hale's regiment, was in fact pressing on Fraser's left. [...] He therefore sent his grenadiers to support Fraser's flank and directed the jägers against the American center.|$|E
