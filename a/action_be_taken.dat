25|$|On May 3, 2012, FLOC {{and several}} {{different}} organizations came together and disrupted {{a meeting of}} CEOs at R.J. Reynolds Headquarters, demanding that the crimes of the company against tobacco farmworkers be acknowledged and that certain <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to relieve {{the pain and suffering}} these workers are enduring in the tobacco fields. The short-term goal was in pressuring them to finally set up a meeting between R.J.R. and FLOC. Their goal was achieved. Soon after the meeting, FLOC and their allies flooded the streets of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and held a long march to both celebrate their first victory and to continue the ongoing pressure against R.J.R.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to complete roll-back {{of the proposed}} reservation, the striking protesters have demanded that an expert committee comprising members from non-political organisations to review the existing reservation policy and find out whether reservation for OBCs is required at all. This {{is based on the}} current confusion over actual population of OBC as various organisations have indicated various figures for the population of OBCs. This is mostly because the 1931 national census was the last time detailed population and economic data was gathered along with caste information for the OBC population. The Mandal Commission, using extrapolated 1931 Census figures, put it at 52 per cent, the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) at 32 per cent and the National Family and Health Survey at 29.8 per cent. Keeping in view the fact that already 23.5% of all college seats are reserved for OBCs, the rationale of extending reservation is debated. The protesters also demand that no penal <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against the protesters and publication of a white paper by the government, making its stand clear on reservation.|$|E

[...] A {{succession}} of angry young Aboriginal men subsequently spoke to the crowd and encouraged immediate <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against the police. [...] Mulrunji's death was repeatedly branded [...] "cold-blooded murder", and a riot erupted.

Later the same day approximately 80police from Townsville and Cairns were flown to Palm to restore order.|$|E
500|$|Mayor Peters {{sought to}} play an {{intermediary}} role by appointing a Citizen's Committee to review the dispute about union representation. He chose a well-known local reformer as its chair, James J. Storrow. Storrow's group recommended that Curtis and the police agree to a police union without AFL ties and without the right to strike. Curtis in turn would recognize the police union and the union would agree to remain [...] "independent and unaffiliated". Storrow's group also recommended that no <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against the 19 men whom Curtis had suspended. Four of Boston's five newspapers backed the compromise, with only the Boston Transcript holding to a consistent anti-union position. The Boston Chamber of Commerce backed it as well.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to events in Cambodia, President Nixon {{believed that there}} were distinct possibilities for a U.S. response.

He was also adamant that some <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to support [...] "The only government in Cambodia in the last twenty-five years that {{had the guts to}} take a pro-Western stand." [...] The president then solicited proposals for actions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and MACV, who presented him with a series of options: a naval quarantine of the Cambodian coast; the launching of South Vietnamese and American airstrikes; the expansion of hot pursuit across the border by ARVN forces; or a ground invasion by ARVN, U.S. forces, or both.|$|E

[...] However, it also concluded that Cornelius, Thomason, and Martens, who all had potential business interests involved, had possibly influenced the decision. [...] Moreover, the GAO report indicated that the First Lady played a larger role than previously thought before the firings, with Watkins saying she had urged [...] "that <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to get 'our people' into the travel office."

500|$|On Friday 19 November 2004, 36-year-old Palm Island {{resident}} Cameron Doomadgee {{was arrested}} for public drunkenness and died in police custody an hour later. The coroner's report was released on Friday 26 November, and read to a community meeting. After hearing that Doomadgee had died from a ruptured liver in the scuffle at the island's watch-house, a succession of angry young Aboriginal men spoke to the crowd and encouraged immediate <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against the police. Doomadgee's death was repeatedly branded [...] "cold-blooded murder". Wotton joined 1,000 other people in a riot on Palm Island {{that resulted in the}} police station, the court house, and the home of the officer-in-charge being burned down. In a Friday interview with The Courier-Mail, Wotton justified the riot, saying that the residents did not believe the death was an accident and the residents had set fire to the police station because they had been [...] "crying out for help" [...] and no one had listened. Additionally, Wotton sought an investigation by the Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC) and wanted the government to agree to move all police from the island.|$|E
500|$|Phelix D'Souza, a {{resident}} of Permannur, alleged that the police took him into custody and tortured him and opened a baseless case against him, sending him to jail for 11 days. Lance Rego, a Mangalore resident, claimed that [...] "many of the police personnel who entered the premises of Holy Cross Church at Kulshekar were wearing helmets usually worn by two-wheeler drivers and not the ones meant for police personnel. Hence, I wonder whether they were police personnel or cadres of the Bajrang Dal." [...] Another resident, Marcel Henry Ferao, alleged that [...] "prohibitory orders were imposed on those who were inside the church compound {{and not on the}} Bajrang Dal cadres who were outside the church compound and were pelting stones". Dinal Saldanha of Kulshekar alleged that the police used tear-gas shells which were past their expiry date on the premises, and that exposure to the gas resulted in problems with her eyesight. Many Catholic women reported incidents of police violence to the Deputy Commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao and other government officials, revealing their bruises, and demanding that <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against them.|$|E

500|$|After a {{time with}} no command, Brett was {{appointed}} commander of the US Caribbean Defense Command and the US Army's Panama Canal Department in succession to Lieutenant General Frank M. Andrews in November 1942. In 1945, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Daniel Isom Sultan, investigated a series of allegations against Brett regarding the misuse of Army funds and property. He reported to [...] General Marshall {{that most of the}} charges were distortions of mission-related events and expenditures, that the remaining allegations had no basis in fact, and that no further <b>action</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Brett requested voluntary retirement and retired on 30 April 1945 with the rank of major general, only to be immediately recalled to active duty the next day as a temporary lieutenant general and as Commanding General of the Caribbean Defense Command and Panama Canal Department. On 10 October 1945, Brett handed over command to Lieutenant General Willis D. Crittenberger. For his service in Panama, Brett was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal. The citation noted [...] "his broad grasp of military strategy and superior knowledge of air and ground tactics" [...] and that [...] "he succeeded admirably in impressing the republics of Central and South America with the importance and necessity of hemispheric solidarity, imbued them with American ideals, coordinated their use of arms and equipment and indoctrinated them with American training methods [...] all of which fostered continued improvement in the relations between all America republics." [...] After spending time as a patient in Brooke General Hospital, he reverted to retired status on 10 May 1946 but was later advanced to the grade of lieutenant general on the United States Air Force retired list by an Act of Congress on 29 June 1948.|$|E
