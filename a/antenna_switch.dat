40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{study the}} effectiveness of <b>antenna</b> <b>switching</b> diversity for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems such as in IEEE 802. 11. One {{of the ways to}} exploit the multiple antenna configurations is to use <b>antenna</b> <b>switching</b> diversity. <b>Antenna</b> <b>switching</b> diversity is used in wireless systems to combat the effect of fading, as we can combine multiple independent copies of the same signal into a total signal with high quality. In this work, we implement and compare the performance of two systems, <b>antenna</b> <b>switching</b> diversity system and single-input single-output (SISO) system. We firstly study the performance of the <b>antenna</b> <b>switching</b> diversity system as we increases the number of antennas compared to the performance of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or gain of the system. The performance of <b>antenna</b> <b>switching</b> diversity is studied on several difference configurations such as receive diversity where there are multiple receive antennas, and transmit diversity where the there are multiple transmit antennas. The study is performed on eight (8) <b>antenna</b> <b>switching,</b> on either the transmit or receive side.

50|$|In 1941, Lorenz {{started to}} re-design it for another design contest by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium for an {{airborne}} naval search radar. As no special antenna had been specified, initially the simplest possible layout with three transversely-arranged antenna arrays was chosen - the central one for transmitting {{and two others}} for receiving, one each to port and starboard of the central transmitting array. Each antenna array possessed sixteen horizontally-oriented dipole elements, in eight sets of two elements each, with each set of four dipole groups vertically stacked comprising each array. For rough guidance, the radio operator had to manually switch the receiving arrays. Later, the device received a motor-driven <b>antenna</b> <b>switch.</b> The received signal strength was displayed on a cathode ray tube so the observer or pilot could roughly gauge the target's heading as 'left', 'right' or 'head on'. The maximum range was 150 km for convoys on the Atlantic. The device was first deployed on Junkers Ju 88, Focke-Wulf Fw 200 and other maritime patrol aircraft and twin-engined torpedo bomber designs, and {{is known to have}} been fitted to Heinkel He 111 medium bombers for training purposes, and experimented with on the Heinkel He 177A. In order to avoid capture after a crash, it was fitted with several small self-destruct explosive charges in each of the system's electronics cabinets, which could be triggered by the pilot.|$|E
50|$|Console {{systems are}} {{played on a}} television. As such the systems need {{a way for the}} {{information}} they process to show up on the screen, and for the audio to be played through a sound system. Originally this was done through an <b>antenna</b> <b>switch</b> box. Later this was changed to a coaxial cable setup called a RF connector. It transmitted both the audio and video through one cable. Modern day systems are quite different though. All of the newer systems use industry standards now. One of those standards is RCA composite cables of single video and left and right audio. The video connector is usually colored yellow while the left and right audios are colored white and red respectively. Now that the newer systems are focusing on HD content and displaying in HD newer types of cable connections are needed. The basic are component cables with the RGB format. RGB stands for the three colors, red, green, and blue. This is the simplest form of HD cables. It uses three cables for video and the two for audio still. The newest form of HD transmittance cables are the High-Definition Multimedia Interface or HDMI cables. The HDMI cables transmit both the video and audio signals over a single cable. More importantly the information transmitted is a digital signal. Other cables utilize analog signals so that modern systems must convert to analog and then back to digital for use. Information is often lost in these conversions so that HDMI keeps the signal as digital so that less information is lost, keeping the signal truer to its source. These cables and signals are too new to be fully utilized, and are really only necessary for 1080p signal.|$|E
40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of wireless communication market {{has led the}} development of low-cost, highly-integrated wireless communication systems. Even though most blocks in the front-end have successfully been integrated by using the CMOS technology, {{it is still a}} formidable challenge to integrate the entire front-end. Thus, the objective of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of the integrated front-end by using improved circuit techniques as well as the improved process technologies. This dissertation proposes an improved control scheme to enhance the high-power handling capability of an <b>antenna</b> <b>switch.</b> As a part of this research, an <b>antenna</b> <b>switch</b> controller for a GaAs <b>antenna</b> <b>switch</b> was first developed to enhance the performances of the GaAs <b>antenna</b> <b>switch</b> by using the boosted control voltage. To enhance the efficiency of the front-end, efficiency improvement techniques for the <b>antenna</b> <b>switch</b> controller has also been studied. With the suggested efficiency improvement techniques, a fully-integrated <b>antenna</b> <b>switch</b> was implemented using the SOI technology, and exceeding performances over many commercial products for watt-level high-power applications have been successfully demonstrated. As an effort to improve the efficiency of a power amplifier, a linear envelope detector was also implemented, and the results show that the envelope detector is suitable for dynamic biasing of the power amplifier. The research presented in this dissertation, thus, provides a low-cost and high-performance solution for highly-integrated RF front-end used in various wireless communication systems. Ph. D.
