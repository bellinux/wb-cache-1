5|$|The {{absence of}} wheels in nature is {{frequently}} attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the {{processes by which}} multicellular organisms grow and develop may not permit the construction of <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> wheel.|$|E
5|$|Using human {{manufacturing}} processes, wheeled {{systems of}} varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, {{and issues of}} power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] keyword {{applied to}} <b>a</b> <b>function</b> {{prototype}} does absolutely nothing (the [...] keyword applied to <b>a</b> <b>function</b> definition is, of course, non-sensical). <b>A</b> <b>function</b> prototype {{is always a}} declaration and never a definition.

5|$|Several {{structures}} such as {{the post}} office are prominent on the skyline of Lethbridge. Less well-known than the High Level Bridge, the post office {{is one of the}} most distinctive buildings in Lethbridge. Built in 1912, the four-storey structure is crowned by <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> clock tower. Other prominent buildings include office towers; the water tower, which was originally built in 1958 and sold to a private developer who converted it into a restaurant; and the Alberta Terminals grain elevators.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991 Somalia has lacked <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> central {{electricity}} grid, but private entrepreneurs {{have offered}} electricity generation on a localised basis, typically offering {{a choice of}} daytime, evening or 24-hour electricity. Gaalkacyo, a desert town in central Somalia, was provided with streetlights by local entrepreneur Abdirizak Osman, who expanded his enterprises from telecommunications to power generators, not only lighting the town but also supplying free electricity to the local hospital.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> {{continuous}} <b>function</b> is <b>a</b> <b>function</b> {{for which}} sufficiently {{small changes in}} the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output. Otherwise, <b>a</b> <b>function</b> {{is said to be}} <b>a</b> discontinuous <b>function.</b> <b>A</b> continuous <b>function</b> with <b>a</b> continuous inverse <b>function</b> is called <b>a</b> homeomorphism.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>function</b> whose {{argument}} {{is an individual}} and whose value is always a first-order proposition will be called <b>a</b> first-order <b>function.</b> <b>A</b> <b>function</b> involving <b>a</b> first-order <b>function</b> or proposition as apparent variable will be called <b>a</b> second-order <b>function,</b> and so on. <b>A</b> <b>function</b> of one variable which is of the order next above that of its argument will be called a predicative function; the same name {{will be given to}} <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of several variables etc.|$|R

Unusually for an English church, {{because of its}} {{location}} in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays. On 4 January 1950, St Botolph's Aldersgate and the surviving ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars were both designated Grade I listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when these populations are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August. This has led researchers to speculate that P. rebeli larvae that do not receive adequate food can still fully develop in one year and act as <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> adult. However, they are unlikely to be bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have continuous development.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{began to}} decline in importance, however, and in 1369 passed to the Despensers and then the Beauchamps, neither of whom used the castle. It was {{temporarily}} refortified by Henry IV {{in response to the}} Owain Glyndŵr uprising in North Wales in 1403. The Nevilles acquired the property in the 15th century and it remained in the control of the Lords of Abergavenny until the 1970s. After the Black Death the town's population fell away sharply as well, the protected area north of the castle was abandoned, and by the 16th century it was no longer <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> trading centre.|$|E
50|$|Precomposition with <b>a</b> <b>function</b> {{probably}} {{provides the}} most elementary notion of pullback: in simple terms, <b>a</b> <b>function</b> f of <b>a</b> variable y, where y itself is <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of another variable x, may be written as <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of x. This is the pullback of f by the function y.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>a</b> <b>function</b> type (or arrow type or exponential) is {{the type}} of a variable or parameter to which <b>a</b> <b>function</b> has or can be assigned, or an argument or result type of <b>a</b> higher-order <b>function</b> taking or returning <b>a</b> <b>function.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{convention}} amended, and on June 12 adopted, George Mason's Declaration of Rights, {{a precursor}} to the United States Bill of Rights. On June 29, the convention approved the first Constitution of Virginia. The convention chose Patrick Henry as the first governor of the new Commonwealth of Virginia, and he was inaugurated on June 29, 1776. Thus, Virginia had <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> republican constitution before July 4, 1776.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two other}} {{historic}} churches in central Roskilde. St Ib's is located below the cathedral plateau near the harbour. Built in travertine around 1100, the Romanesque building was once richly decorated in frescos, remains {{of which can be}} seen on the rear wall. It is no longer <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> church. St Jørgensbjerg Church stands on a little hill to the northwest of the old town, overlooking the fjord. With a nave and chancel in travertine dating from c. 1080, it is Denmark's oldest preserved stone building. It features a carved pulput from 1616.|$|E
5|$|Tom Burstyn {{handled the}} cinematography, and the {{production}} designers were Michael Joy and Collin Niemi. James L. Conway contributed to the show as a consulting producer, and Joel McNeely composed the musical score. Although the show is set in Boston, filming took place in Montreal, Canada. The episodes were shot in <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> asylum constructed in Montreal during the 19th century, with real patients walking around during certain scenes, which Frost said added a sense of realism to the series.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, <b>a</b> <b>function</b> {{object is}} <b>a</b> construct allowing an object to be invoked or called {{as if it}} were <b>an</b> ordinary <b>function,</b> usually with the same syntax (<b>a</b> <b>function</b> parameter that can also be <b>a</b> <b>function).</b> Function objects are often called functors.|$|R
5000|$|In {{mathematical}} optimization, statistics, econometrics, decision theory, {{machine learning}} and computational neuroscience, <b>a</b> loss <b>function</b> or cost <b>function</b> is <b>a</b> <b>function</b> that maps <b>an</b> event or values {{of one or}} more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some [...] "cost" [...] associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize <b>a</b> loss <b>function.</b> An objective <b>function</b> is either <b>a</b> loss <b>function</b> or its negative (in specific domains, also variously called <b>a</b> reward <b>function,</b> <b>a</b> profit <b>function,</b> <b>a</b> utility <b>function,</b> <b>a</b> fitness <b>function,</b> etc.), in which case it is to be maximized.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, and {{particularly}} in functional analysis and the calculus of variations, a functional is <b>a</b> <b>function</b> from <b>a</b> vector space into its underlying field of scalars. Commonly the vector space is a space of functions; thus the functional takes <b>a</b> <b>function</b> for its input argument, then it is sometimes considered <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of <b>a</b> <b>function</b> (<b>a</b> higher-order <b>function).</b> Its use originates in the calculus of variations, where one searches for <b>a</b> <b>function</b> that minimizes <b>a</b> given functional. A particularly important application in physics is searching for a state {{of a system that}} minimizes the energy functional.|$|R

Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E

5|$|His decade-long reign {{over the}} Kievan Rus' {{was marked by}} rapid {{expansion}} into the Volga River valley, the Pontic steppe, and the Balkans. By {{the end of his}} short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital in 969 from Kiev (modern-day Ukraine) to Pereyaslavets (identified as the modern village of Nufăru, Romania) on the Danube. In contrast with his mother's conversion to Christianity, Sviatoslav remained a staunch pagan all of his life. Due to his abrupt death in ambush, his conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a fratricidal feud among his three sons, resulting in two of them being killed.|$|E
5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining <b>a</b> <b>functioning</b> society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
