50|$|Precipitation is plentiful, {{with the}} annual total {{estimated}} to be about 65 inches (1625 mm) distributed well across all months. Snowfall is also plentiful, averaging about 170 inches (67 cm) a season. Unusually snowy winters can produce 275 inches (108 cm) or more. Snow usually begins falling in early October, ending by early May. Occasional periods of rainfall and temperatures in the 50's F are common even in the coldest months due to the relatively southerly location of the summit (39 degrees N) allowing for mild above freezing <b>air</b> <b>intrusions</b> from the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|International audienceDuring winter, {{the polar}} vortex forms a {{dynamical}} barrier {{in the arctic}} stratosphere which prevents large scale exchanges between the high latitude and tropical regions. Nevertheless, the occurrence of thin tropical <b>air</b> mass <b>intrusions</b> {{at the edge of}} the polar vortex have in fact been detected and modeled. These structures could play an important role in improving our knowledge of the balance between chemical and dynamical processes associated with the ozone budget. After the final stratospheric warming in springtime, the breakdown of the polar vortex occurs and the summer circulation starts to develop. <b>Air</b> mass <b>intrusions</b> from the tropics can be trapped at polar latitudes and persist until August in the anticyclone, advected by summer easterlies. These structures, named "frozen-in anticyclones" (FrIACs), have already been observed in 2003 and 2005 by MIPAS-ENVISAT and MLS-AURA tracer measurements. We present here a new case of FrIAC in 2007 highlighted using MLS-AURA measurements. In order to better understand the dynamical conditions required for such events and the associated processes, we performed a climatology of tropical <b>air</b> mass <b>intrusions</b> using a potential vorticity contour advection model. This climatology reveals a preferred path for exchanges between the polar and tropical stratospheres. Using ERA-Iterim wind and temperature reanalysis from ECMWF, we have established links between FrIAC occurrences and Rossby wave activity.

40|$|Preliminary {{attempts}} of quantifying the stratospheric ozone contribution in the observations at the Zugspitze summit (2962 m a. s. l.) next to Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the German Alps had yielded an approximate {{doubling of the}} stratospheric fraction of the Zugspitze ozone during the time period 1978 to 2004. These investigations had been based on data filtering by using low relative humidity (RH) and elevated 7 Be as the criteria for selecting half-hour intervals of ozone data representative of stratospheric <b>intrusion</b> <b>air.</b> To quantify the residual stratospheric component in stratospherically influenced air masses, however, the mixing of tropospheric air into the stratospheric intrusion layers {{must be taken into}} account. In fact, the dewpoint mirror instrument at the Zugspitze summit station rarely registers RH values lower than 10 % in stratospheric <b>air</b> <b>intrusions.</b> Since 2007 a programme of routine lidar sounding of ozone, water vapour and aerosol has been conducted in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen area. The lidar results demonstrate that the intrusion layers are drier by roughly one order of magnitude than indicated in the in situ measurements. Even in thin layers RH values clearly below 1 % have frequently been observed. These thin, undiluted layers present an important challenge for atmospheric modelling. Although the ozone values never reach values typical of the lower-stratosphere it becomes, thus, obvious that, without strong wind shear or convective processes, mixing of stratospheric and tropospheric air must be very slow in most of the free troposphere. As a consequence, the analysis the Zugspitze data can be assumed to be more reliable than anticipated. Finally, the concentrations of Zugspitze carbon monoxide rarely drop inside intrusion layers and normally stay clearly above full stratospheric values. This indicates that most of the CO, and thus the <b>intrusion</b> <b>air</b> mass, originates in the shallow "mixing layer" around the thermal tropopause. The CO mixing ratio in these descending layers between 1990 and 2004 exhibits a slightly positive trend indicating some Asian influence on the lowermost stratosphere in the high-latitude source region of most intrusions reaching the station...|$|R

40|$|The wintertime Pacific–North American (PNA) teleconnection {{pattern has}} {{previously}} been shown to in-fluence springtime snow conditions over portions of North America. This paper develops a more complete physical understanding of this linkage across the continent, using a recently released long-term, continental-scale gridded North American snow depth dataset and the 40 -yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis data. An empirical orthogonal function–based filtering process is used to identify and isolate the interannual snow depth variations associated with PNA. Then linear and partial correlations are employed to investigate the physical mechanisms that link winter PNA with spring snow depth. In the positive phase of PNA, the enhanced PNA pressure centers lead to warmer temperatures over northwestern North America and less precipitation at midlatitudes. The temperature and precipitation pathways act independently and in distinct geographical regions, and together they serve to reduce winter snow depth across much of North America. Winter anomalies in the snow depth field then tend to persist into spring.

Three cases mapped with the lidar were selected to validate the results for the corresponding time periods extracted from a one-year run with the new hemispheric version of the chemistry-transport model EURAD. Due to the high spatial resolution chosen for these simulations the agreement with the lidar measurements is satisfactory. The Zugspitze ozone data from 1978 to 2004 were recently filtered by applying different criteria for stratospheric air, based on the 7 Be and humidity measurements. Here, by using the daily model forecasts during the time period 2001 – 2005, we examine three criteria and determine how well they represent the stratospheric <b>air</b> <b>intrusions</b> reaching the mountain site. Seasonal cycles for the period 2001 – 2005 were derived for the forecasts as well as the intrusion frequency per month for the forecasted intrusions and each of the criteria, distinguishing eight different characteristic transport pathways. In most cases a winter maximum and a summer minimum was obtained, {{but in the case of}} cyclonic arrival of intrusions starting over Greenland a late-spring maximum is seen. Two of the filtering criteria examined, based on combining a relative-humidity (RH) threshold of 60 % with either a 7 Be threshold of 5. 5 mBq m&minus; 3 or the requirement for RH&le; 30 % within &plusmn; 6 h, rather reliably predict periods of deep intrusions reaching the Zugspitze station. An "or" combination of both these criteria yields slightly more cases and covers 77. 9 % of the intrusions identified. The lack of observations in the complementary 22. 1 % are mostly explained by overpasses.

In particular, the uplifting in the Alpine thermal wind system was investigated. The air in the valley is vented to heights in part even beyond 4 km a. s. l. during fair-weather summer days. The high efficiency of the underlying mechanism suggests a major contribution of the orographically induced transport in the Alps to the pollution export from the Central European boundary layer.

To our knowledge, the first paper on schlieren photography of Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) was published by Moen and Gibson in 1952 [94]. The authors used a 1.25  μs shutter and a 5  μs flash tube to investigate the behavior of argon and helium as shield gases, with a z-type schlieren setup and several different welding positions. In each picture the arc region is affected by light overexposure, but nonetheless by using a knife-edge in the horizontal position it was possible to verify the coverage of the shielding gas on the welded metal plate. Another paper published in the late 70 ’s involving the schlieren imaging of GTAW and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) sources was written by Kiyohara et al. [110]. The authors solved the arc light overexposure issue by using a He-Ne laser source (main wavelength 632.8  nm) with a bandpass filter and an Ω-type optical setup, allowing them to analyze the interface between the shield gas and surrounding air for different operating currents and shield gas flow rates.

A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hurricane Hunter aircraft intercepted Ivan during the afternoon and evening of September 15.

The transition from convective to stratiform rain is clear in all four datasets, indicating a coherence from local to 100 -km scale. A novel finding is dry <b>air</b> <b>intrusions</b> at altitudes of 6 – 8 km, often undercutting upper-level ice clouds. Two distinct dry air source regions are identified. One is a relatively dry area overlying the cooler waters of the Costa Rica oceanic thermocline dome, centered approximately 400 km east-northeast of the ship site. The other is the even drier nearequatorial subsidence zone south of 6 °– 7 °N. The former source is somewhat peculiar to this specific ship location, so that the ship sample is not entirely representative of the region. The 20 – 25 September period is studied in detail, as it depicts two influences of the dry air on cloud vertical structure. One is the modulation of small-scale surface-based convection, evident as a weakening and narrowing of cloud radar reflectivity features. The other springs from intense sublimation cooling as differential advection brought snowing anvil clouds over the dry layers. During one half-day period of stron...|$|R
40|$|At the East Antarctic deep ice core {{drilling}} site Dome C, daily precipitation measurements have been initiated in 2006 {{and are being}} continued until today. The amounts and stable isotope ratios of the precipitation samples as well as crystal types are determined. Within the measuring period, the two years 2009 and 2010 showed striking contrasting temperature and precipitation anomalies, particularly in the winter seasons. The reasons for these anomalies and their relation to stable isotope ratios are analysed {{using data from the}} mesoscale atmospheric model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model) run under the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS). 2009 was relatively warm and moist due to frequent warm <b>air</b> <b>intrusions</b> connected to amplification of Rossby waves in the circumpolar westerlies, whereas the winter of 2010 was extremely dry and cold. It is shown that while in 2010 a strong zonal atmospheric flow was dominant, in 2009 an enhanced meridional flow prevailed, which increased the meridional transport of heat and moisture onto the East Antarctic plateau and led to a number of high-precipitation/warming events at Dome C. This was also evident in a positive (negative) SAM index and a negative (positive) ZW 3 index during the winter months of 2010 (2009). Changes in the frequency or seasonality of such event-type precipitation can lead to a strong bias in the air temperature derived from stable water isotopes in ice cores...|$|R
