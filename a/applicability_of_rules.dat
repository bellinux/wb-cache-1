However, for the specification of more complex operations we have to provide some mechanism to control the transformation process. One way to do this, is to control <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> directly by so-called application conditions. The basic idea is, that the graphs and matches involved in the transformation have to satisfy certain conditions. These can be specified [...] ...|$|E

These systems do not change the underlying structure of the graph on which they work, but only the labelling of its components (edges or vertices). Each relabelling step is fully determined by the knowledge of a xed size subgraph, the local context of the relabelled occurrence. The studied families {{are based on the}} relabelling of partial or induced subgraphs and we use two kinds of mechanisms to locally control the <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> : a priority relation on the set of rules or a set of forbidden contexts associated with each rule.

Our attention in this paper is focused specifically on artefacts at the boundary of mathematical and contextual activities.

Conversely, is the drive towards regional free trade {{a threat to the}} goals of federalism and decentralization? These are two of the many questions that arise in revisiting NAFTA and eyeing the successful creation of a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) by the year 2005, an initiative launched by thirty-four nations within the region in December 1994. Part I of this Article first defines federalism and distinguishes it from other decentralized forms of government. It proceeds to explore the goals of federalism and the goals of international trade agreements, with specific reference to regional agreements. Part 12 ̆ 2 analyzes the broadened scope of modem trade agreements and the accompanying importance of constraining sub-central government actions. Part III discusses the particular 2 ̆ 2 problems 2 ̆ 2 raised by federal forms of government for regional free trade and economic integration.

Part V considers possibilities for sub-national governments to participate in the rule formation processes so as to overcome political and legal obstacles to achieving Pareto gains in the relationship between regional free trade and federalism. Part VI concludes that Pareto gains in the relationship between free trade and federalism can occur by strengthening the application of anti-protectionism obligations to sub-federal governments.

In previous works, we introduced Matrix Graph Grammars (MGGs) as a purely algebraic approach for the study of graph grammars and graph dynamics, based on the representation of graphs by means of their adjacency matrices. MGGs have been succesfully applied to problems such as <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> sequences, sequentialization and reachability, providing new analysis techniques and generalizing and improving previous results. Our next objective is to generalize MGGs in order to approach computational complexity theory and "static" properties of graphs out of the "dynamics" of certain grammars. In the present work, we start building bridges between MGGs and complexity by introducing what we call "Monotone Complex Logic", which allows establishing a (bijective) link between MGGs and complex analysis. We use this logic to recast the formulation and basic building blocks of MGGs as more proper geometric and analytic concepts (scalar products, norms, distances). MGG rules can also be interpreted - via operators - as complex numbers. Interestingly, the subset they define can be characterized as the Sierpinski gasket. Comment: 30 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
