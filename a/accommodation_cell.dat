40|$|Antibody-mediated {{rejection}} (AMR) {{has been}} identified as a main obstacle for stable immune tolerance and long survival of kidney allografts. In spite of new insights into the underlying mechanisms of AMR, accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment are still challenges in clinical practice. Endothelium is the first barrier between recipients’ immune systems and grafts in vascularized organ transplants. Considering that endothelial cells express a number of antigens that can be attacked by various allo- and autoantibodies, endothelial cells act as main targets for the recipients’ humoral immune responses. Importantly, emerging evidence has shown that endothelial cells in transplants could also initiate protective mechanisms in response to immune injuries. A better understanding of the role of endothelial cells during the pathogenesis of AMR might provide novel therapeutic targets. In the present review, we summarize the antigens expressed by endothelial cells and also discuss the activation and <b>accommodation</b> of endothelial <b>cells</b> as well as their clinical implications.

40|$|In this essay, {{we discuss}} the {{contribution}} of local cell interactions, as opposed to global cues, such as hormones and morphogens, to {{the determination of the}} size and shape of organs. This internalistic notion is based on the integration of physiological experiments, clonal analysis and genetic mosaics of morphogenetic mutants. Physiological experiments such as regeneration, cell dissociation and re-aggregation, and feeder layers, reveal the existence of regional specificities related to regional patterning, positional values and cell polarity. On the other hand, clonal analysis shows homogeneous and exponential growth by mitosis associated with oriented cell divisions along two axes of growth. Preferential mitotic orientations are also regional characteristic. Finally, genetic mosaics of morphogenetic mutants help to understand the genetic and eventually the molecular bases of morphogenesis, revealing the modes of cell behavior (such as positional <b>accommodation,</b> mitotic orientations, <b>cell</b> affinities and cell recognition) at work in the generation of the constant sizes and shapes of Drosophila imaginal structures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malaria {{is one of}} {{the major}} human {{infectious}} diseases in many endemic countries. For prevention of the spread of malaria, it is necessary to develop an early, sensitive, accurate and conventional diagnosis system. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cell microarray chip was used to detect for malaria-infected erythrocytes. The chip, with 20, 944 microchambers (105 µm width and 50 µm depth), was made from polystyrene, and the formation of monolayers of erythrocytes in the microchambers was observed. Cultured Plasmodium falciparum strain 3 D 7 was used to examine the potential of the cell microarray chip for malaria diagnosis. An erythrocyte suspension in a nuclear staining dye, SYTO 59, was dispersed on the chip surface, followed by 10 min standing to allow the erythrocytes to settle down into the microchambers. About 130 erythrocytes were accommodated in each microchamber, there being over 2, 700, 000 erythrocytes in total on a chip. A microarray scanner was employed to detect any fluorescence-positive erythrocytes within 5 min, and 0. 0001 % parasitemia could be detected. To examine the contamination by leukocytes of purified erythrocytes from human blood, 20 µl of whole blood was mixed with 10 ml of RPMI 1640, and the mixture was passed through a leukocyte isolation filter. The eluted portion was centrifuged at 1, 000 ×g for 2 min, and the pellet was dispersed in 1. 0 ml of medium. SYTO 59 was added to the erythrocyte suspension, followed by analysis on a cell microarray chip. Similar <b>accommodation</b> of <b>cells</b> in the microchambers was observed. The number of contaminating leukocytes was less than 1 on a cell microarray chip. CONCLUSION: The potential of the cell microarray chip for the detection of malaria-infected erythrocytes was shown, it offering 10 - 100 times higher sensitivity than that of conventional light microscopy and easy operation in 15 min with purified erythrocytes...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{studies of}} the responsiveness to cholinergic agonists and the electrical membrane properties of neurons of the prevertebral, sympathetic, celiac ganglion of the guinea pig in primary culture. More specifically, the major content of this work is {{the investigation of the}} mechanisms of slow cholinergic or muscarinic excitation in these cells. The primary mechanisms of muscarinic responses in these cells resulted from the inhibition of two potassium currents: the M-current and a muscarine-sensitive leak-current. During intracellular current-clamp recording, cells were assessed for their passive and active membrane properties including: resting potential, time constant, input resistance, rheobase, spike amplitude, afterhyperpolarization amplitude and duration, and degree of <b>accommodation.</b> These <b>cells</b> responded to acetylcholine with both fast nicotinic and slow muscarinic depolarizations. The results indicated that celiac neurons in primary culture retain certain electrophysiological properties similar to those in intact ganglia, and produce varied responses to cholinergic stimulation. Responses to muscarine were studied in the dissociated neurons using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Muscarine, administered to cells for 1. 5 seconds, evoked inward shifts in holding current which were concentration-dependent. The amplitude of the inward current transients decreased with hyperpolarization toward the equilibrium potential for potassium, where the null or reversal potential was reached. Evidence for the presence of the M-potassium current was obtained in eighty percent of the neurons. Further investigation, however, revealed that these cells exhibit two ubiquitous and independent mechanisms of muscarinic excitation. These two mechanisms were the inhibition of two potassium currents: the M-current and a muscarine-sensitive leakage current. These currents could be expressed together in the same neuron or separately. The cation potassium channel blockers, cesium and barium, had dissimilar effects on these currents. While barium effectively blocked both types of potassium channels equally, cesium preferentially blocked M-current. Thus, cesium was able to differentiate between the two currents...|$|R

Promoter DNA {{methylation}} {{may reflect}} the interac-tion between genetic background and environmental factors {{in the development of}} metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T 2 D).

Using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology, the DNA methyla-tion levels of eight CpG dinucleotides on the miR- 375 promoter were measured in 48 T 2 D cases and 48 healthy controls. The majority of CpGs (with the exception of CpG 7) had significantly higher methylation levels in women compared with those in men (P< 0. 05). The methylation levels of the eight CpGs were significantly correlated with each other (P< 0. 001). No significant association between miR- 375 gene promoter methylation and the risk of T 2 D was identified (P= 0. 417). Similar results were observed in the breakdown analysis by gender (men, P= 0. 844; women, P= 0. 234). In addition, although a correlation between the CpG 8 methylation level of miR- 375 and total triglyceride level was identified in women (P= 0. 009), DNA methylation of the majority of CpGs in the miR- 375 gene promoter was not associated with the clinical metabolic features of the individuals...|$|R

40|$|Mitotic cells undergo {{extensive}} {{changes in}} shape and size through the altered regulation and function of their membrane trafficking machinery. Disabled 2 (Dab 2), a multidomain cargo-specific endocytic adaptor and a mediator of signal transduction, is a potential integrator of trafficking and signaling. Dab 2 binds effectors of signaling and trafficking that localize to different intracellular compartments. Thus, differential localization is a putative regulatory mechanism of Dab 2 function. Furthermore, Dab 2 is phosphorylated in mitosis and is thus regulated in the cell cycle. However, {{a detailed description of}} the intracellular localization of Dab 2 in the different phases of mitosis and an understanding of the functional consequences of its phosphorylation are lacking. Here, we show that Dab 2 is progressively displaced from the membrane in mitosis. This phenomenon is paralleled by a loss of co-localization with clathrin. Both phenomena culminate in metaphase/anaphase and undergo partial recovery in cytokinesis. Treatment with 2 -methoxyestradiol, which arrests cells at the spindle assembly checkpoint, induces the same effects observed in metaphase cells. Moreover, 2 -methoxyestradiol also induced Dab 2 phosphorylation and reduced Dab 2 /clathrin interactions, endocytic vesicle motility, clathrin exchange dynamics, and the internalization of a receptor endowed with an NPXY endocytic signal. Serine/threonine to alanine mutations, of residues localized to the central region of Dab 2, attenuated its phosphorylation, reduced its membrane displacement, and maintained its endocytic abilities in mitosis. We propose that the negative regulation of Dab 2 is part of an <b>accommodation</b> of the <b>cell</b> to the altered physicochemical conditions prevalent in mitosis, aimed at allowing endocytic activity throughout the cell cycle...|$|R

While endocytosis {{has been extensively}} studied and {{is thought to be}} a major mechanism for accommodating the volume changes as evidenced mainly by fluorescent labelling and confocal imaging, studies at the ultrastructural level in intact guard cells of stomata regulated by natural factors have never been reported. Here, it is reported that excretion and folding of the plasmalemma are critical for accommodating the volume alterations in intact guard cells in Vicia faba L. Using transmission electron microscopy in combination with laser confocal microscopy, it was observed that in fully opened stomata the plasmalemma was smooth and tightly adhered to the cell walls while a whole large vacuole appeared in the cell. In the closed stomata, besides vacuole fragmentation, endocytosis of the tonoplast rather than the plasmalemma commonly occurred. Importantly, in stomata where pore closure was induced by circadian rhythm or CO 2, numerous tiny vesicles were found outside the plasmalemma and, moreover, extensive folding of the plasmalemma could also be found in some regions of the cells. Additionally, an unknown structure was found at the interface between the plasmalemma and cell walls, especially in those areas of the cell where extensive folding occurred, suggesting that plasmalemma turnover is possibly associated with an interaction between the plasmalemma and cell walls. Collectively, the results strongly indicate that excretion and folding of the plasmalemma are critical for the <b>accommodation</b> of the <b>cell</b> volume alterations during stomatal movement...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the psychosocial influences on female prisoner suicide by {{carrying out a}} study of near-lethal self-harm. We interviewed 60 women prisoners who had recently engaged in near-lethal self-harm (cases) and 60 others who had never carried out near-lethal acts in prison (controls) from all closed female prison establishments in England and Wales, using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. We gathered information on socio-demographic and criminological variables, life events and childhood trauma, exposure to suicidal behaviour, contributory and precipitating factors for near-lethal self-harm, social support and psychological characteristics. While socio-demographic factors were only modestly associated with near-lethal self-harm, being on remand, in single <b>cell</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and reporting negative experiences of imprisonment were strong correlates. Recent life events and past trauma, including different forms of childhood abuse, were also significantly associated with near-lethal self- harm, as were {{a family history of}} suicide and high scores on measures of depression, aggression, impulsivity and hostility, and low levels of self-esteem and social support. Our findings underline the importance of both individual and prison-related factors for suicide in custody, and hence the need for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention in women’s prisons. Given the multiple needs of female prisoners at-risk of self-harm and suicide, complex psychosocial interventions are likely to be required, including interventions for abused and bereaved women, and initiatives to improve staff-prisoner relationships and reduce bullying. The findings of this research may provide insights into factors leading to suicidal behaviour in other forensic and institutional settings, such as detention centres and psychiatric hospitals, and may assist in developing suicide prevention policies for prisoners and other at-risk populations...|$|R
