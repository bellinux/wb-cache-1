40|$|Aim : To {{explore the}} {{efficacy}} of tear trough deformity treatment {{with the use of}} hyaluronic acid gel or autologous fat for soft tissue augmentation and fat repositioning via <b>arcus</b> <b>marginalis</b> release. Material and methods : Seventy-eight patients with the tear trough were divided into three groups. Class I has tear trough without bulging orbital fat or excess of the lower eyelid skin. Class II is associated with mild to moderate orbital fat bulging, without excess of the lower eyelid skin. Class III is associated with severe orbital fat bulging and excess of the lower eyelid skin. Class I or II was treated using hyaluronic acid gel or autologous fat injections. Class III was treated with fat repositioning via <b>arcus</b> <b>marginalis</b> release. The patients with a deep nasojugal groove of class III were treated with injecting autologous fat into the tear trough during fat repositioning lower blepharoplasty as a way of supplementing the volume added by the repositioned fat. Results : Seventy-eight patients with tear trough deformity were confirmed from photographs taken before and after surgery. There were some complications, but all had complete resolution. Conclusions : Patients with mild to moderate peri-orbital volume loss without severe orbital fat bulging may be good candidates for hyaluronic acid filler or fat grafting alone. However, patients with more pronounced deformities, severe orbital fat bulging and excess of the lower eyelid skin are often better served by fat repositioning via <b>arcus</b> <b>marginalis</b> release and fat grafting...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze prospectively 50 {{patients}} submitted to lower blepharoplasty allocated to two surgical groups at Federal University of So Paulo, between April 2005 and May 2007. Fifty patients were assigned for interventions into two surgical groups by using random allocation. the SG 1 (control group) was composed of 25 patients who were submitted to conservatively standard fat-resection lower blepharoplasty, and routine lateral canthal support. the SG 2 (experimental group) was represented by 25 patients submitted to lower blepharoplasty with periorbital fat mobilization and <b>arcus</b> <b>marginalis</b> redrape, and routine lateral canthal support. Preoperative demographic and morphological data from patient charts and standardized photographs obtained before and after surgery were evaluated by an independent observer. Surgical techniques and management of complications were determined from operative reports and clinical notes. The median follow-up was 395 days (range 364 to 547 days). the mean age was 48. 8 years; the population's gender was predominantly female (96 %). Analysis of preoperative and postoperative photographs showed that all patients achieved significant improvement. Lateral canthal support was performed in all patients with statistically significant results. The authors concluded that both procedures are safe and effective, with low complication rates.

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} {{the architecture of the}} upper eyelid is very important in numerous upper eyelid corrective surgeries. The article deals with the detailed anatomy of the major components of the upper lid, which are commonly seen in surgical practice. Methods. This study was conducted on 19 human cadavers (12 adults and 7 infants) without pathologic changes in the orbital region and eyelids. Anatomic microdissection of the contents of the orbita was performed bilaterally on 12 orbits from 6 unfixed cadavers (3 male and 3 female). Micromorphologic investigations of the orbital tissue were performed on 8 en bloc excised and formalin-fixed orbits of infant cadavers. Specimens were fixed according to the Duvernoy method. An intra-arterial injection of 5 % mixture of melt formalin and black ink was administered into the carotid arterial system. Using routine fixation, decalcination, dehydration, illumination, impregnation and molding procedures in paraplast, specimens were prepared for cross-sections. Results. The measurement of the muscle length and diameter in situ in 6 nonfixed cadavers (12 orbits) showed an average length of the levator palpbrae superioris (LPS) muscle body of the 42. 0 ± 1. 41 mm on the right, and 40. 3 ± 1. 63 mm on the left side. In all the cases, the LPS had blood supply from 4 different arterial systems: the lacrimal, supratrochlear, and supraorbital artery and muscle branches of the ophthalmic artery. The LPS muscle in all the specimens was supplied by the superior medial branch of the oculomotor nerve. The connective tissue associated with the LPS muscle contains two transverse ligaments: the superior (Whitnall’s) and intermuscular transverse ligaments (ITL). The orbital septum in all the specimens originated from the <b>arcus</b> <b>marginalis</b> of the frontal bone, and consisted of two layers - the superficial and the inner layer. In addition, a detailed histological analysis revealed that the upper eyelid’s crease was formed by the conjoined fascia including the fascia of the orbicularis muscle, the superficial layer of the orbital septum, and the aponeurosis of the LPS muscle, as well as the pretarsal fascia. Conclusion. The conducted study provided a valuable morphological basis for biomechanical and clinical considerations regarding blepharoptosis surgery.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Foi realizado um estudo prospectivo com objetivo de avaliar os resultados de cinquenta pacientes submetidos a blefaroplastia {{inferior}} transcutânea, visando a análise do resultado clínico e a satisfação dos pacientes na Universidade Federal de São Paulo, entre abril de 2005 e maio de 2007. MÉTODOS: Os pacientes foram alocados aleatoriamente em dois grupos cirúgicos. O Grupo Cirúrgico 1 (Grupo Controle) foi composto por 25 pacientes submetidos a blefaroplastia inferior tradicional e cantopexia lateral de rotina. O Grupo Cirúrgico 2 (Grupo Experimental) foi composto por 25 pacientes submetidos a blefaroplastia inferior com transposição das bolsas adiposas e cantopexia lateral de rotina. Para avaliar os resultados obtidos foi utilizado a avaliação da autoestima dos pacientes, por meio da Escala de Autoestima de Rosenberg UNIFESP/EPM. O outro método utilizado foi solicitar a participação de três cirurgiões independentes que avaliaram as fotografias de pré e pós-operatório e com auxílio de uma escala topográfica, quantificaram os resultados. RESULTADOS: A média de idade foi de 48, 8 anos, com predomínio do sexo feminino (96 %). A análise das fotografias mostrou que 96 % dos pacientes apresentaram melhora significativa. A autoestima melhorou de um escore médio no pré-operatório de 5, 1 (desvio padrão = 4, 1) para um valor médio de 3, 6 (desvio padrão = 3, 5) após 6 meses da cirurgia (p= 0, 001). CONCLUSÃO: Os autores concluíram que ambos os procedimentos seriam seguros e eficazes, com baixo índice de complicação, apresentando melhora da autoestima, visível após seis meses da cirurgia. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze prospectively fifty patients submitted to lower eyelid blepharoplasty at the Federal University of São Paulo, between April 2005 and May 2007. METHODS: Fifty patients were assigned to interventions into two surgical groups by using random allocation. The Surgical Group 1 (control group) was composed of 25 patients who were submitted to conservatively standard fat-resection lower eyelid blepharoplasty, and routine lateral canthal support. The Surgical Group 2 (experimental group) was represented by 25 patients submitted to lower eyelid blepharoplasty with periorbital fat mobilization and <b>arcus</b> <b>marginalis</b> redrape, and routine lateral canthal support. The self-esteem of all patients was compared with those in 25 age-matched volunteers from the general population. The parameters of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were determined preoperatively and at 6 -month interval postoperatively. Standardized photographs obtained before and after surgery were evaluated by three independent observers. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 395 days (range 364 to 547 days). The mean age was 48. 8 years, the population's gender was predominantly female (96 %). Analysis of preoperative and postoperative photographs showed that 96 % patients achieved significant improvement. Self-esteem scores improved from baseline preoperative mean levels of 5. 1 (Standard Deviation = 4. 1) to a mean level of 3. 6 (Standard Deviation = 3. 5) at 6 months post-surgery (p= 0. 001). No patients had orbital hematoma, blepharitis, lagophthalmos or ectropion. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that both procedures are safe and effective with low complication rates, and marked improvement in self-esteem was observed in patients at 6 -month follow-up...|$|E
