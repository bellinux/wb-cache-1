5|$|After a {{gestation}} {{of about}} 25 days, {{three to five}} young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may have up to six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4g (about 0.10 to 0.15oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day, claws are visible <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> emit high-pitched squeaks. On the second day, {{they are able to}} crawl, and during the third to fifth days, the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and 11th days, the eyes open, the fur develops, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the 11th to 20th day, according to different studies. Considerable variation is reported in body masses at different ages, perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60days old. In the wild, rice rats usually live for less than a year; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed the {{impression}} that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, {{both of whom}} {{he heard}} on the radio and playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Flanagan and his friends were more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E

When the only volunteers are Hawk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E

5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} man in Norway, at first supported by Harald Bluetooth of Denmark and paying tribute to him—though the two later fell out over religious matters.

5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a {{relatively}} quiet bird, {{but it has a}} warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression. There is a chip contact call, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptation}} to the screen has continued with the trend of including new scenes to flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially seen through {{the point of view}} characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, and the conversation between King Robert and Queen Cersei, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted at in the books.|$|E

This species is listed as Least Concern, meaning it is not threatened with extinction.|$|E
