This version of events is essentially as told by the Norse sagas and is supported by some archaeological evidence although it has been criticised for exaggerating Orcadian influence in the Suðreyar.|$|E

At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Ornamentation <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in {{the music}} of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang {{is not an}} {{explosion}} of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not {{an explosion}} in space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E

5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> different name.|$|E
5|$|A {{story from}} the Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana and the Brihaddharma Purana (13th century) narrates the {{creation}} of all Mahavidyas, including Chhinnamasta. The story is as follows: Sati, the daughter of Daksha, is the first wife of the god Shiva. When she and Shiva are not invited to the fire sacrifice organized by her father, she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, Chhinnamasta stands {{to the right of}} Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the Brihaddharma Purana describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.|$|E
5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E

40|$|Background: This article {{presents}} cohort studies that use {{data from the}} National Health Information Survey from 1986 to 1994 and compares the effectiveness of Cox proportional hazards models that <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> linear relationship between body mass index (BMI) {{and the risk of}} prostate cancer with models that <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> J-shaped relationship. Methods and results: Our study found that for black males over 40 years of age, neither a linear nor a J-shaped relationship yielded a statistically significant model. With white males over 40 years, <b>assuming</b> <b>a</b> linear relationship did not yield a statistically significant model (P = 0. 582). When we <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> J-shaped relationship, the optimal change point where the risk of prostate cancer death is minimized occurs when the BMI is 25. 5. Among white males over 40 years with BMI 3 ̆c 25. 5, an inverse relationship was found (P = 0. 009). Among white males over 40 years with BMI 3 ̆e 25. 5, a direct relationship was found (P = 0. 017). Conclusion: With this data set, we found that for white males over 40 years, Cox proportional hazards models that <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> J-shaped relationship between BMI and prostate cancer death provide a much better fit than models <b>assuming</b> <b>a</b> linear relationship...|$|R

5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theories for forces {{developed from}} the unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified, with his universal theory of gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near {{the surface of the}} Earth with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.|$|E
