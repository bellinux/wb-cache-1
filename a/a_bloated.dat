5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E

50|$|Nomenclature of the pygmy {{hippopotamus}} reflects {{that of the}} hippopotamus. The plural form is pygmy hippopotami (hippopotamuses is also accepted as a plural form by the OED, or pygmy hippos for short). A male {{pygmy hippopotamus}} {{is known as a}} bull, a female as a cow, and a baby as a calf. A group of hippopotami is known as a herd or <b>a</b> <b>bloat.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fiscal {{policy is}} {{constrained}} by erratic fiscal revenues, <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> civil service wage bill, and an external debt {{that is far}} above the HIPC threshold.

25|$|The Boomer is <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> {{infected}} {{that can}} spit vision-impairing bile on the Survivors, attracting hordes of infected, and explodes on death, spewing more bile {{in the immediate}} area. They emit burping and vomiting like sounds when close by. A 5-note double bass cue plays to signal Boomer.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} decisions made during Smith's tenure was the partial elimination of divisional autonomy in 1984. In the 1920s, Chairman and CEO Alfred Sloan, Jr. had established semi-autonomous divisions within the corporation, each designing and marketing their own vehicles (Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac). This was considered a crucial factor propelling GM past market leader Ford in the 1930s. By the 1980s however, that autonomy (also including Fisher Body division producing the car bodies, and GM Assembly division building them) were seen as representing a dated business model that had led to needless large scale redundancy, infighting by the divisions, and <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> internal bureaucracy.|$|E
30|$|Fabric soiling {{was done}} {{according}} to AATCC test method 130. On <b>a</b> <b>bloating</b> paper fabric specimen sized 4 ″×[*] 4 ″ was kept and approximately 0.2  ml of soil (mustard oil or hot coffee) {{was placed on}} it. On top of the soil pool, glassine paper was placed and a 2.3  kg weight with 2.5 ″ diameter cylinder covering the soil and rested for one minute to force the soil into the fabric. Weight and glassine paper were removed and soiled fabrics were aged in open air for two hours before laundering.|$|R

25|$|Changing {{the title}} of the {{screenplay}} to La Dolce Vita, Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted Paul Newman as a hedge on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul Angelo Rizzoli. Shooting began on 16 March 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing the stairs to the cupola of Saint Peter’s in a mammoth décor constructed at Cinecittà. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to Saint Peter's Square was inspired by an actual media event on 1 May 1956, which Fellini had witnessed. The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at Passo Oscuro with <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> mutant fish designed by Piero Gherardi.|$|E
25|$|Williamson's heirs {{sold the}} mine for about £4 million GBP to an equal {{partnership}} between De Beers and the colonial government of Tanganyika on August 13, 1958. In 1971, {{a decade after}} Tanzania's independence, the government nationalized the mine. Although details are unknown, De Beers and other diamond industry players speculate that mine performance deteriorated significantly in the 1980s under government management. Suspected causes of this are a decrease in ore grade as the mine's richer deposits were worked out, loss of skilled foreign management and engineering staff, <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> labor force resulting from government employment efforts, and inadequate capital investment in the mine's equipment. Perhaps {{as a result of}} this poor performance, Tanzania invited De Beers to purchase back into the mine, which the company did. In 1994 De Beers bought 75% of the Williamson mine, with Tanzania retaining the remaining shares.|$|E
25|$|As Finance Minister, Netanyahu {{undertook}} {{an economic}} plan {{in order to}} restore Israel's economy from its low point during the Second Intifada. Netanyahu claimed that <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more liberalized markets, {{although it was not}} without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the El Al national airline, and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. The retirement ages {{for both men and women}} were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to find {{a leader}} that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team. Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well {{regarded}} for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise. Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season. Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager. The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks 2006 first round pick, {{and the right to}} swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks. Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59. The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.|$|E

Greg Melton, the series' production designer, collaborated with KNB Efx Group in producing the scene. Filming for the sequence arose over an approximate period of two days.|$|E
60|$|The bailiff gave a {{direction}} {{we did not}} hear, and we drove off. He proved a bluff fellow with <b>a</b> <b>bloat</b> yet not unkindly humour, and despite his calling seemed to have something that was human in him. He passed many a joke on that pitiful journey {{in an attempt to}} break our despondency, urging us not to be downcast, and reminding us that the last gentleman he had taken from Pall Mall was in over a thousand pounds, and that our amount was a bagatelle. And when we had gone through Temple Bar, instead of keeping on down Fleet Street, we jolted into Chancery Lane. This roused me.|$|R

500|$|Low-mass helium white dwarfs (with a mass < 0.20 , often {{referred}} to as [...] "extremely low-mass white dwarfs, ELM WDs") are formed in binary systems.

500|$|Water is a {{limiting}} {{resource for}} Bankers, as the islands {{are surrounded by}} salt water and have no freshwater springs or permanent ponds. [...] The horses are dependent on ephemeral pools of rainwater and moisture in the vegetation they consume. Bankers will dig shallow holes, ranging from [...] in depth, to reach fresh groundwater. Occasionally, they may resort to drinking seawater. This gives them <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> appearance, a consequence of water retention caused by the body's effort to maintain osmotic balance.|$|E

[...] Foraker was not prominent {{in support of}} Hanna; he did endorse his junior colleague in mid-September, and made several speeches soon after the announcement, but thereafter maintained a public silence which would continue until after the vote for senator by the newly elected legislature in January 1898.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} provides possible {{opportunities in}} the reuse of waste and particularly muds, coming from both ornamental stone (granite sludges from sawing and polishing operations) and ceramic production (porcelain stoneware tile polishing sludge), for the manufacture of lightweight aggregates. Lab simulation of the manufacturing cycle was performed by pelletizing and firing the waste mixes in a rotative furnace up to 1300 °C, and determining composition and physicomechanical properties of lightweight aggregates. The best formulation was used to produce and test lightweight structural concretes according to standard procedures. Both granite and porcelain stoneware polishing sludges exhibit a suitable firing behavior due to the occurrence of SiC (an abrasive component) which, by decomposing at high temperature with gas release, acts as <b>a</b> <b>bloating</b> promoter, resulting in aggregates with particle density 20 MPa, bulk density 1. 4 - 2. 0 Mg/m 3) ...|$|R
500|$|During {{his time}} on the throne, Peribsen founded an {{administrative}} center called [...] "The white house of treasury" [...] {{as well as a}} new royal residence, called the [...] "protection of Nubt", located near Ombos ("Nubt" [...] being the Ancient Egyptian name of Naqada). The administrative titles of scribes, seal-bearers and overseers were adjusted to correspond to the divided bureaucratic state administration. For example, titles like [...] "sealer of the king" [...] were changed into [...] "sealer of the king of Upper Egypt". This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials, further evidence for <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer.|$|E

In 2000, Jordan joined the World Trade Organization and signed the Jordan–United States Free Trade Agreement, thus becoming the first Arab country to establish {{a free trade agreement}} with the United States. Jordan also has free trade agreements with Turkey and Canada. Jordan enjoys advanced status with the EU, which has facilitated greater access to export to European markets. Due to slow domestic growth, high energy and food subsidies and <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> public-sector workforce, Jordan usually runs annual budget deficits. These are partially offset by international aid.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet geaster {{alludes to}} members of genus Geastrum, which also open to form star-shaped fruit bodies commonly called 'earthstars'. In the United States, Chorioactis geaster {{is commonly known as}} the Texas star, or the devil's cigar. Regarding the origin of the latter name American mycologist Fred Jay Seaver commented: [...] "Whether the name Devil's Cigar refers to the form of the young specimens which resemble <b>a</b> <b>bloated</b> cigar in form, as well as in color, or {{to the fact that the}} fungus appears to 'smoke' at maturity, we cannot say... At any rate, the name is very appropriate." [...] In 1997, Texan state Senator Chris Harris filed a bill to make C.geaster the official state fungus of Texas. The bill passed the Senate but did not succeed in the House. In Japan the mushroom is called kirinomitake (キリノミタケ), because the immature, unopened fruit body bears a superficial resemblance to the seed pods of kiri, the empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa).|$|E
