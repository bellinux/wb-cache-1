50|$|Typically {{fired at}} a range of 25 yards, the rearsight can be {{adjusted}} to allow fire at 50 and 100 yards. A harmonisation setting is also provided for firing at specially designed targets. The No 8 can also be fitted with two types of sight. The more common leaf sight, allowing adjustment for elevation only, is simpler to use and more robust, but the standard of accuracy {{that can be achieved}} with this sight is lower than can be achieved with the Parker Hale PH5D sight, which allows for windage adjustment as well as elevation, in 1/4 minute-of-angle clicks. It is also more delicate than the leaf-sight and not generally found in cadet service. The Parker-Hale 8/53 sight <b>adaptor</b> <b>unit</b> can also be fitted to the leaf rearsight, providing windage adjustment without the removal of the issued sighting system. It screws on through the sight aperture and therefore introduces a large elevation difference, rendering the range markings on the sight useless.|$|E
50|$|Most ICEs {{consist of}} an <b>adaptor</b> <b>unit</b> that sits between the ICE host {{computer}} and the system to be tested. A pin header and cable assembly connects the adaptor to a socket where the actual central processing unit (CPU) or microcontroller mounts within the embedded system. Recent ICEs enable programmers to access the on-chip debug circuit that is integrated into the CPU via JTAG or background debug mode interface (BDM) to debug the software of an embedded system. These systems often use a standard version of the CPU chip, and can simply attach to a debug port on a production system. They are sometimes called in-circuit debuggers or ICDs, to distinguish {{the fact that they}} do not replicate the functionality of the CPU, but instead control an already existing, standard CPU. Since the CPU need not be replaced, they can operate on production units where the CPU is soldered in and cannot be replaced. On x86 Pentiums, a special 'probe mode' is used by ICEs to aid in debugging.|$|E

40|$|The SH 2 domain-containing {{inositol}} 5 '-phosphatase (SHIP) plays a {{key role}} in preventing autoimmune phenomena by limiting antigen-mediated B cell activation. SHIP function is thought to require the dual engagement of the BCR and negative regulatory coreceptors as only the latter appear capable of recruiting SHIP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by virtue of phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Here we demonstrate a coreceptor-independent membrane recruitment and function of SHIP in B cells. In the absence of coreceptor ligation, SHIP translocates to sites of BCR activation through a concerted action of the protein <b>adaptor</b> <b>unit</b> Dok- 3 /Grb 2 and phosphorylated BCR signaling components. Our data reveal auto-inhibitory SHIP activation by the activated BCR and suggest an unexpected negative-regulatory capacity of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in Igα and Igβ...|$|E

The plug and socket replaced the BS546 plug and socket, which are still found in old installations or in special applications. [...] BS1363 plugs have been designated as TypeG.|$|R
40|$|The HERMES {{high-resolution}} spectrograph project aims at {{exploiting the}} specific potential of small but flexible telescopes in observational astrophysics. The optimised optical {{design of the}} spectrograph {{is based on the}} well-proven concept of white-pupil beam folding for high-resolution spectroscopy. In this contribution we present the complete project, including the spectrograph design and procurement details, the telescope <b>adaptor</b> and calibration <b>unit,</b> the detector system, as well as the optimised data-reduction pipeline. We present a detailed performance analysis to show that the spectrograph performs as specified both in optical quality and in total efficiency. With a spectral resolution of 85 000 (63 000 for the low-resolution fibre), a spectral coverage from 377 to 900 nm in a single exposure and a peak efficiency of 28 %, HERMES proves to be an ideal instrument for building up time series of high-quality data of variable (stellar) phenomena. © 2010 ESO.
