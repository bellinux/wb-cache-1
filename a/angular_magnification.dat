40|$|We {{investigate}} the gravitational lensing {{effect in the}} strong field background around the Schwarzschild black hole with extremely small mass and solid deficit angle subject to the global monopole {{by means of the}} strong field limit issue.

We discuss that with the increase of parameter η, the minimum impact parameter u_m and angular separation s increase and the relative magnification r decreases. We also find that s grows extremely greatly as the increasing parameter η becomes large enough. The effect from the solid deficit angle is the dependence of angular position, angular separation and relative magnification on parameter η, which may offer a way to characterize some possible distinct signatures of the Schwarzschild black hole with a solid deficit angle associated with global monopole.

40|$|Apart {{from the}} known weak {{gravitational}} lensing effect, the cosmic magnification acquires relativistic corrections owing to Doppler, integrated Sachs-Wolfe, time-delay and other (local) gravitational potential effects, respectively. These corrections grow on very large scales and high redshifts z, {{which will be}} the reach of forthcoming surveys. In this work, these relativistic corrections are investigated in the <b>magnification</b> <b>angular</b> power spectrum, using both (standard) noninteracting dark energy (DE), and interacting DE (IDE). It is found that for noninteracting DE, the relativistic corrections can boost the magnification large-scale power by ~ 40 % at z = 3, and increases at lower z. It is also found that the IDE effect is sensitive to the relativistic corrections in the magnification power spectrum, particularly at low z [...] -which will be crucial for constraints on IDE. Moreover, the results show that if relativistic corrections are not taken into account, this may lead to an incorrect estimate of the large-scale imprint of IDE in the cosmic magnification; including the relativistic corrections can enhance the true potential of the cosmic magnification as a cosmological probe.

50|$|A {{different}} {{interpretation of}} the working of the latter case is that the magnifying glass changes the diopter of the eye (making it myopic) so that the object can be placed closer to the eye resulting in a larger <b>angular</b> <b>magnification.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} in a refracting telescope refracts or bends light.

At each of the three points shown, the three-lens system is afocal (neither diverging or converging the light), and hence does not alter the position of the focal plane of the lens.

50|$|An {{alternative}} approach for explaining the globe effect {{comes from the}} technical journalist and optics specialist Walter E. Schön. He states that the observed effect is in fact not that of a rolling globe but that of a vertically rotating cylinder. The globe shape of the illusion seen by most observers is only because {{the field of view}} through the optical device is circular. This illusion of a rotating cylinder during panning is caused by the horizontal movement of the image being (due to the <b>angular</b> <b>magnification</b> of the device) faster and more uniform (with less parallax) compared to the naked eye and also not corresponding to the felt rotational speed of the observer's head. When the brain tries to integrate these conflicting signals, it creates the perception that the image is moving slower at the left and right edges than in the middle, giving the illusion of a rotating cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|The {{magnification}} of {{a magnifying}} glass depends upon where it is placed between the user's eye and the object being viewed, and the total distance between them.

40|$|The {{increase}} of angular dispersion and slit resolution limit of grating spectrometers {{by means of}} variation of grating parameters is limited by its period and allowable order of diffraction. The special solutions (echelle, holographic, immersion gratings) are acceptable in a limited parameter range and are technologically complex in fabrication, thus hardly applicable to instruments of mass production. We propose to decrease slit resolution limit by one-dimensional beam widening in dispersion plane by means of passing it through oblique prism before incidence onto diffraction grating. The {{increase of}} angular dispersion {{can be achieved by}} narrowing of dispersed beams after grating while passing through other oblique prism. We prove that slit resolution limit in such a system changes approximately as multiplied by <b>angular</b> <b>magnification</b> of the first prism (that is less than 1 times).
