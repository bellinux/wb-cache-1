25|$|An <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> and {{constitutional}} amendment for the JEP.|$|E
25|$|January 24 — Armenian activist Vahagn Chakhalyan (under arrest since 2008) {{released}} from prison under <b>amnesty</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|Decision no. 2001/332, dated 18.07.2001: The Court, in {{response}} to applications made by regular courts, ruled that {{some parts of the}} <b>Amnesty</b> <b>Law</b> passed by the parliament were unconstitutional, which resulted in a minor expansion in the scope of the proposed amnesty.|$|E
5000|$|Laws {{aiming at}} {{overturning}} <b>Amnesty</b> <b>Laws</b> {{dating back to}} Gen. Augusto Pinochet military dictatorship.https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2013/09/chile-40-years-pinochet-s-coup-impunity-must-end/ ...|$|R
50|$|Regardless of its {{legality}}, {{the legality}} and possible guilt became a moot point after <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> were passed after the war.|$|R
50|$|The <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> {{created a}} new {{challenge}} for the human rights movement in Peru. They thwarted the demands for truth and justice that thousands of family members of victims of political violence have been making since the 1980s. Thus, {{after the fall of}} Alberto Fujimori in 2001, the Inter-American Court ruled that the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> 26.479 and 26.492 were invalid because they were incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights. The court later specified that the ruling was applicable to all Peruvian cases.|$|R
25|$|Critics {{consider}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006 an <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> for crimes {{committed in the}} War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act. It abolished habeas corpus for foreign detainees, effectively {{making it impossible for}} detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.|$|E
25|$|The Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{is seen as}} an <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> {{for crimes}} {{committed}} in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act and by abolishing habeas corpus, effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.|$|E
25|$|The final agreement, in its annexes, {{includes}} {{the text of}} the <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> which would be presented to Congress. There would be three types of offences: ones directly eligible for amnesty (those most closely related to membership in the guerrilla), ones which would never be eligible for amnesty and others which would be defined the amnesty chamber of the JEP (including drug trafficking and kidnapping).|$|E
5000|$|Later, {{some members}} of Grupo Colina were put on trial. Fujimori signed a {{controversial}} <b>law</b> that granted <b>amnesty</b> to anyone accused of, tried for, convicted of, or sentenced for human rights violations that were committed by the armed forces or police. When a court found this law unconstitutional, Fujimori signed a new law removing the right of judicial review over <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws.</b> This second law {{was known as the}} [...] "Barrios Altos Law" [...] because it ensured that those members of Grupo Colina who committed the Barrios Altos massacre would be freed. Eventually, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights struck down both <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court {{declared}} unconstitutional the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> introduced {{during the}} transition to democracy (Ley de Punto Final, 1986 and Ley de Obediencia Debida, 1987). Since the identification of Duquet's body, France has been seeking extradition of Astiz on charges of murdering Duquet.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> {{are often}} also equally {{problematic}} to the opposing side as a cost-benefit problem: Is bringing the old leadership to justice worth extending the conflict or {{rule of the}} previous regime, with an accompanying increase in suffering and casualties, as the old regime refuses {{to let go of}} power? ...|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1990 the Lebanese Civil War was {{effectively}} over. In March 1991, the National Assembly of Lebanon passed an <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment, and in May 1991, the militias—with the important exceptions of Hezbollah and the SLA—were dissolved, and the Lebanese Armed Forces began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN) issued {{their first}} {{declaration}} {{from the state}} of Chiapas in southern Mexico. The date coincides with the date that NAFTA came into force. Salinas immediate response works for a peaceful solution: offers pardon to deposed arms; orders cease fire; appointed the peace negotiator and send Mexican Congress a General <b>Amnesty</b> <b>Law.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March 1991, {{parliament}} {{passed an}} <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> that pardoned all political crimes {{prior to its}} enactment. The amnesty was not extended to crimes perpetrated against foreign diplomats or certain crimes referred by the cabinet to the Higher Judicial Council. In May 1991, the militias (with the important exception of Hezbollah) were dissolved, and the Lebanese Armed Forces began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.|$|E
50|$|President Kirchner {{took office}} on May 25, 2003. He reshuffled the {{leadership}} of the Armed Forces, overturned controversial <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> that protected members of the 1976-1983 dictatorship from prosecution, and kept Lavagna on as economy minister for most of his presidency. Kirchner's administration saw a strong economic rebound, and foreign debt restructuring.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} of the Tarascha district, where Gongadze's {{body was}} found, {{was convicted in}} May 2003 for abuse of office and falsification of evidence. Serhiy Obozov {{was found guilty of}} forging documents and negligence in the investigation and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. However, he was immediately released due to a provision of Ukraine's <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{taking office}} in 2003, the Néstor Kirchner {{administration}} shifted the focus towards the uncovering and punishment of {{crimes of the}} Dirty War, including those formerly covered by the now-repealed <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> passed in the mid-1980s. In August 2005, a judge struck Menem's pardons as unconstitutional, and a final pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the matter is expected soon.|$|R
25|$|In August 1990, the {{parliament}} {{and the new}} president agreed on constitutional amendments embodying some of the political reforms envisioned at Taif. The National Assembly expanded to 128 seats and was divided equally between Christians and Muslims. In March 1991, parliament passed an <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> that pardoned most political crimes prior to its enactment, excepting crimes perpetrated against foreign diplomats or certain crimes referred by the cabinet to the Higher Judicial Council.|$|E
25|$|Slowly {{however, the}} {{wear and tear}} of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the {{inability}} to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Geisel and Golbery. With the enactment of the <b>Amnesty</b> <b>Law</b> in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Following a stakeout, the Sûreté arrested Sadoul in Paris (where he {{was visiting}} the PCF's Jacques Doriot), and {{dispatched}} him to Cherche-Midi prison. By then, {{the government was}} advancing an <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> project, defended in Senate by René Renoult, the Justice Minister. At the time, Renoult announced that Herriot was ready to use his pardoning power in case Senate refused to pass the law. Sadoul himself made clear his intent of standing trial, and employed Berthon as his lawyer.|$|E
50|$|This {{change was}} an {{important}} phase in the 2005 ruling which stated that crimes of forced disappearances were crimes against humanity (Caso Simon). Two years earlier, the Congress had declared the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> (1986 Ley de Punto Final and 1987 Ley de Obediencia Debida) unconstitutional, thus opening up {{the way for the}} trials of suspects of human rights violations during the dictatorship.|$|R
5000|$|Luis María Mendía did {{not benefit}} from the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> enacted during the {{transition}} to democracy (full stop law and law of due obedience) but from an amnesty declared by president Carlos Menem in October 1989. However, he appeared before the courts {{for his role in the}} ESMA case, one of the largest concentration camps and torture centers used by the military. The ESMA case was reopened by the Argentine courts following the Supreme Court's 2003 decision declaring the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> anti-constitutional. Under house arrest because of his age (82 years old), in 2007 Luis María Mendía finally admitted before magistrate Sergio Torres [...] "complete responsibility" [...] for the security forces under his direction. He called his subordinates [...] "heroes". He was also questioned in the case of the disappearances of two French nuns, Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet, in which Alfredo Astiz (alias [...] "Angel of Death") is also being prosecuted.|$|R
2500|$|Under Néstor Kirchner's term as president, in 2003 the Argentine Congress revoked {{the longstanding}} <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws,</b> {{also called the}} [...] "Pardon Laws." [...] In 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled these laws were unconstitutional. The {{government}} re-opened prosecution of war crimes. From then through October 2011, 259 persons were convicted for crimes against humanity and sentenced in Argentine courts, including Alfredo Astiz, a notorious torturer, that month.|$|R
25|$|Although the Algerian {{issue was}} settled, Prime Minister Michel Debré {{resigned}} {{over the final}} settlement and was replaced with Georges Pompidou on 14 April 1962. France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, while a blanket <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> was belatedly voted in 1968, covering all crimes committed by the French army during the war. In {{just a few months}} in 1962, 900,000 Pied-Noirs left the country. After 5 July, the exodus accelerated {{in the wake of the}} French deaths during the Oran massacre of 1962.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 Taif Agreement {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the end of the fighting. In January 1989, a committee appointed by the Arab League began to formulate solutions to the conflict. In March 1991, parliament passed an <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment. In May 1991, the militias were dissolved, with the exception of Hezbollah, while the Lebanese Armed Forces began to slowly rebuild as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution. Religious tensions between Sunnis and Shias remained after the war.|$|E
25|$|With Franco's {{death in}} November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the {{position}} of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the franquist law. With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities. The Spanish 1977 <b>Amnesty</b> <b>Law</b> let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha.|$|E
50|$|Following {{continuous}} protests by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo {{and other}} human rights groups, in 2003 the Argentine Congress, counting on President Nestor Kirchner and the ruling majority on both chambers full support, repealed the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws.</b> The Argentine Supreme Court under separate review declared them unconstitutional in June 2005. This enabled the government to renew prosecution of crimes committed during the Dirty War.|$|R
40|$|By {{granting}} {{immunity from}} prosecution to alleged and even confessed perpetrators, <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> {{may be seen as}} a violation of fundamental international obligations to prosecute serious and systematic crimes against human life as well as in violation of victim's rights to seek redress. As such, amnesty legislation can hinder, rather than facilitate post-conflict reconciliation and the reassimilation of minority groups into the larger polity...|$|R

25|$|For {{his conduct}} as President of Zimbabwe, {{including}} allegations {{of torture and}} murder of political opponents, it is suggested Robert Mugabe may be prosecuted using this doctrine. Because Zimbabwe has not subscribed to the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction it may be authorised by the United Nations Security Council. The precedent for this was set by its referral to bring indictments relating to the crimes committed in Darfur. Otherwise, a Zimbabwean regime following Mugabe's would have jurisdiction over his alleged crimes (in {{the absence of any}} <b>amnesty</b> <b>law)</b> as would the numerous countries with universal jurisdiction over torture, including the UK.|$|E
25|$|Pinochet's attorneys, {{headed by}} Pablo Rodríguez Grez (former {{leader of the}} far-right group Fatherland and Liberty), argued that he was {{entitled}} to immunity from prosecution first as a former head of state, then under the 1978 <b>amnesty</b> <b>law</b> passed by the military junta. They furthermore claimed that his alleged poor health made him unfit to stand trial. A succession of judgments by various Courts of Appeal, the Supreme Court, medical experts, etc., led to Pinochet's successive house arrest and release, before he died on 10 December 2006, just after having been again put under house arrest on 28 November 2006 in the Caravan of Death case.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{extradition}} to Turkey, he {{was imprisoned}} for the 1979 murder of Abdi İpekçi {{and for two}} bank raids {{carried out in the}} 1970s. Ağca was arrested on June 25 and incarcerated in the Maltepe Military Prison. He fled to Bulgaria on 25 November and was sentenced to death in absentia. Ağca was extradited to Turkey in 2000 by benefiting from the Conditional <b>Amnesty</b> <b>Law.</b> This consideration granted to the ex-convict elicited strong reactions. Both cases about Ağca were merged and tried before the Kadıköy 1st High Criminal Court. The single trial concerned the hijacking of Cengiz Aydos's taxi in 1979, robbing the Yıldırım jewelry store in Kızıltoprak on 22 March 1979 and stealing money from the Fruko soda storage on 4 April 1979.|$|E
50|$|He was amnestied {{under the}} Ley de Obediencia Debida, then arrested again and {{remained}} in preventive detention {{for his role}} in the case of stolen babies. After the repeal of the <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> in 2003, the cases against him were re-opened. In August 2006, the Argentine justice decided to take the ESMA case, in which Jorge Eduardo Acosta is to be judged along with Alfredo Astiz and Adolfo Miguel Donda.|$|R
5000|$|Five days later, {{he created}} the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP), led by Argentine writer Ernesto Sábato. However, it was also under Alfonsín's {{presidency}} that the December 24, 1986 [...] "Full stop law" [...] was voted, granting amnesty to all acts committed before December 10, 1983, amid pressure from the military. It would not be until June 2005's Supreme Court decision to overturn all <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws</b> that investigations could be started again.|$|R
50|$|Truth and {{reconciliation}} commissions are frequently established by nations emerging from periods marked by {{human rights violations}} - coups d'état, military dictatorships, civil wars, etc. - in order to cast light on {{the events of the}} past. While such mechanisms can assist in the ultimate prosecution of crimes and punishment of the guilty, they have often been criticised for perpetuating impunity by enabling violators to seek protection of concurrently adopted <b>amnesty</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|R
