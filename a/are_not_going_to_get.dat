2500|$|In particular, Waldon criticizes reporters asking {{questions}} like [...] "'Did you kill your wife?'" [...] It's those silly questions that elevate a perp walk to a circus. That's {{the stuff of}} a Saturday Night Live skit. I think any question that's insulting, presumptuous or bullying is totally off limits." [...] Crime reporter Art Harris suggests that such questions are not designed to elicit real answers: [...] "Usually you get no response. The journalists who shout probably know they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an answer but the reporter gets the voice on tape and his boss says, 'Hey, hey he is out there doing his job.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Their first {{project was}} to assess the {{administration}} of voter registration and elections in Montgomery, Alabama. [...] But they immediately ran into resistance. Circuit Judge George C. Wallace, who was elected as governor in support of white supremacy, ordered voter registration records to be impounded. [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the records," [...] he said. [...] "And if any agent of the Civil Rights Commission comes down to get them, they will be locked up. ... I repeat, I will jail any Civil Rights Commission agent who attempts to get the records." [...] The hearing went forward with no shortage of evidence. Witness after witness testified to inappropriate interference with his or her right to vote. The Commissioners spent the night at Maxwell Air Base, because all the city's hotels were segregated.|$|E
6000|$|... “Not if he {{were really}} a saint, Wilcox. However, don’t {{make up your mind}} that you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your teeth into that junk till I give up the hope of making a fire.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> French, and sceptical, and sneering? You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{think it}} {{a sign of}} wisdom to refuse to admire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Bellamy, I <b>am.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand being bullied and jeered at by {{that damned}} scoundrel Caresfoot any more. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand your eternal visits to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The same in effect. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{attend to}} {{nonsensical}} gossip. Georgina {{is what she}} was then, {{and the same is}} right for me now as was right last year. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn against her--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up again,' said Albinia, {{catching}} hold of him, {{and in her}} {{dread of}} his committing himself to {{the mercy of the}} horses, returning unmeaning thanks to the carpenter's urgent requests that she would take refuge in his house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't--I didn't have {{anything}} to do with Hamilton. I--I didn't know he was out till afterwards," [...] went on the bully, fiercely. [...] "Don't you say such a thing--don't you dare!" [...] His face was very white. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me into trouble!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes, I {{have noticed}} that; but I have a vague sort of feeling just now that things <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better. I don't know whether it's this long-continued darkness, or the want of good food, but I feel more downcast than I ever {{was in my}} life before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill me?" [...] she moaned, {{turning up}} her ghastly face. [...] "I can't die. I'm afraid to die. It will hurt, and I've been wicked. Oh, you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill me, <b>are</b> you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Again {{something}} {{written before}} Tommy {{had actually been}} formed as a total idea, and that particular song wasn't about Tommy's devotees at all. It was about the rabble in general, how we, myself as part of them, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take fascism, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take dreary, dying politics; <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take {{things the way they}} were, the way they always had been and that we were keen to change things." [...] Pete Townshend ...|$|R
6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> care about it. What did it matter if her class did ever so badly in the quarterly examination. Let it--what did it matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be up to by {{themselves}} at this hour of the morning?" [...] he said to himself. [...] "Well, they are two nice young fellows anyway, and I hope that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into mischief. Now I will just make up the fire, and then sit down for an hour's snooze in my arm-chair. The captain said {{he was to be}} called at six. I suppose they are going out still-hunting somewhere. Well, I wish them luck; for when the boys can get their whisky for next to nothing they don't care about coming here, and small blame to them, for I shouldn't myself." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{to leave}} off {{abruptly}} at the last page because Aristides had {{come in with a}} piece of news that took my mind off everything else. I am afraid you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this letter even at the late date I had set for its reaching you, my dear. It seems {{that there has been a}} sort of mutiny among the crew of our trader, which was to sail next week, and now there is no telling when she will sail. Ever since she came the men have been allowed their liberty, as they call it, by watches, but the last watch came ashore this week before another watch had returned to the ship, and now not one of the sailors will go back. They had been exploring the country by turns, at their leisure, it seems, and their excuse is that they like Altruria better than America, which they say they wish never to see again.|$|E
60|$|The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to {{the world}} again. Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even {{scraping}} up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty {{to see and hear}} and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask you any questions. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask for any explanations. I {{think that}} we have passed all that. It is of the future I wanted to speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Of course not,' said I, {{a little}} irritated--he has such queer ways of taking what I say. 'I mean I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die before you do. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave {{you in this}} world {{to take care of}} yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father is}} {{angry at the}} present time," [...] said Bertie, looking up for a moment from his sketches, [...] "because I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry Mrs. Bold. What can I say on the matter? It is true that I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry her. In the first place--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall each take a horse, and a Mexican pony {{to carry}} our food and traps. If {{everything}} goes right {{and we find}} a bonanza, we can load {{them up on the}} way back. Twenty dollars will buy a pony here. Then you will want a critter each to ride. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> first-rate ones, for if the Indians come on us it is fighting that we shall have to do, not riding. Among those mountains no shod horse of the plains has a chance with those Indian ponies, which can climb like goats and go at a gallop along places where a horse from the plains wouldn't dare move. Then you will want rifles and six-shooters. That is about all; I am afraid our stock of money will hardly run to it, and I think we had better work for a while in one of the diggings to make up what we shall want." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{are going}} to destroy the Jews. They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away with what they did on 9 November 1918. The day of {{reckoning}} has come.|$|E
5000|$|In early May 1967, Dylan told {{reporter}} Michael Iachetta: [...] "Songs {{are in my}} {{head like}} they always are, but they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> written down until some people come forth and make up {{for some of the}} things that had happened", probably referring to his conflict with his manager Albert Grossman. During the period in which he started recording with The Hawks, Dylan changed his writing habits and wrote his text directly on a typewriter.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{give any}} examples. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say,-- 'Suppose you thought {{this and this}} about yourself, and were proud of it; and then suppose that you recollected that you had done that and that: would you not feel very much taken down in your own conceit?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try any detective work; to {{find out}} if she is a woman with a past, with a husband living? You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put a live adder among the eels? I daresay drysalters eat eels. It is the reading of sensational novels that ruins our youth.' ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{decided to}} retire from the sport {{at the start of}} 2013. Back {{problems}} had reduced his capacity to train and he felt the very top level was now beyond him: [...] "I feel confident I could still run marathons in 2:09 or 2:10 but those times <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me into the top three of the best marathons these days". He paid tribute to his coach, Patrick Sang, and said that he hoped {{to spend more time with}} his family and managing his business portfolio.|$|E
5000|$|As a result, {{the desired}} premium pricing {{for the new}} {{technology}} was harder to achieve, and capacity had shifted to other sectors. SDRAM manufacturers and chipset creators were, to an extent, [...] "stuck {{between a rock and}} a hard place" [...] where [...] "nobody wants to pay a premium for DDR4 products, and manufacturers don't want to make the memory if they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a premium", according to Mike Howard from iSuppli. A switch in market sentiment toward desktop computing and release of processors having DDR4 support by Intel and AMD could therefore potentially lead to [...] "aggressive" [...] growth.|$|E
5000|$|Rick Adam, CEO of {{now defunct}} Adam Aircraft Industries, {{disagreed}} and says, [...] "people <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{on a plane}} without a bathroom, at least {{they are not going}} to do it more than once". However, the new air taxi service companies, which made up the bulk of the Eclipse 500 orders, conducted surveys that showed that having a toilet is not a concern for most of their passengers. The CEO of DayJet said that even if his company outgrew the Eclipse 500, he would have had his company's larger planes configured without a toilet.|$|E
50|$|He {{realised}} that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{escape the}} disease.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} all to me, feyther, since I was a child, and I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave you now. I don't say that Varley is {{altogether}} nice, but I shall be very happy here with you and the boys and dear little Susan, and I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave, and so--there!" ...|$|R
50|$|I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak much, {{otherwise}} I'll again say something.|$|R
50|$|In society, it was {{believed}} that if people lose their chastity, they will get divine punishment. Others <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that punishment. Referring to the doctrines of institutionalized orthodox religions, {{he went on to say}} that men need not to worry themselves that women are committing a sin by not doing household work. Thus, let men realize that women are not slaves and that men are not their masters or guardians. Women should be allowed to develop the competence to protect themselves and their chastity and men need not be their watchdogs. He also believed that it was derogatory for men to play such a role.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{covers the}} topic of media {{manipulation}} and disinformation [...] while referencing to protests such as Occupy Wall Street and Yo Soy 132. Regarding the song, the band's singer and lyricist Residente said: [...] "Media is controlling everything, even people's minds, everything. Here in the U.S. it's worse, it's like a bubble ... It's important {{to have the right}} information, and you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that from one newspaper or one TV show. You have to look for that. In order to get the full picture, you have to read a lot and look for yourself. Otherwise you'll find yourself in a war that you think is a good idea, but it's not for a good reason." ...|$|E

6000|$|I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{draw any}} far-fetched analogy between the miracle {{recorded}} in the gospel, and the subject on which I am speaking. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put any mystical and mediaeval interpretation on the seven loaves, or the two small fishes. I only ask you to accept the plain moral practical lesson which the words convey.-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gwendolen, in {{the same}} tone, and with a quickness which implied that it was needless to ask questions. [...] "Everything is settled. You <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Sawyer's Cottage, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{inspected}} by Mrs. Mompert, and everything is to be as I like. So come down with me immediately." ...|$|R
