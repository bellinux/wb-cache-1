5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area.

A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops.

5|$|Once {{the birds}} begin to forage on their own, they move <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> parents' territory; young birds {{have been found}} nearly 500km <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> nest site. One-year-old European birds migrate to Africa and stay there {{for at least one}} year. A vulture that fledged in France stayed in Africa for three years before {{migrating}} north in spring. After migrating back to their breeding areas, young birds move widely in search of good feeding territories and mates. The full adult plumage is attained in the fourth or fifth year. Egyptian vultures have been known to live for up to 37 years in captivity and at least 21 years in the wild. The probability of survival in the wild varies with age, increasing till the age of 2 and then falling at the age of 5. Older birds have an annual survival probability varying from 0.75 for non-breeders to 0.83 for breeding birds.|$|E

The Scout is required to have camped <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{northern}} storm petrel undertake migrations after the breeding season. Species undertake migrations of differing lengths; long ones, {{such as the}} Swinhoe's storm petrel, which breeds in the west Pacific and migrates to the west Indian Ocean; or shorter ones, such as the black storm petrel which nests in southern California and migrates down the coast of Central America {{as far south as}} Colombia. Some species, like the Tristram's storm petrel, are thought to be essentially sedentary and do not undertake any migrations <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> breeding islands.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> place of residence to vote in the referendum, nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, or by e-mail. When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk.

5|$|The {{revolt of}} the Batavi {{appears to have}} led to a {{significant}} change in the Roman government's policy on deployment of Auxilia. The revolt proved that in times of civil strife, when legions were far from their bases campaigning for rival claimants to the imperial throne, it was dangerous to leave provinces exclusively in the hands of auxiliary regiments recruited from the indigenous nation. During the Julio-Claudian period, auxiliary regiments had often been deployed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> original home province. But in the Flavian period (69–96), this appears to have become standard policy. Thus in AD 70, 5 reconstituted Batavi regiments (one ala and four cohortes) were transferred to Britain under Petillius Cerialis, who had suppressed the Civilis revolt and then embarked on the governorship of the island. The great majority of regiments probably founded in the 1st century were stationed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> province of origin in the second e.g. of 13 British regiments recorded in the mid-2nd century, none were stationed in Britain. Furthermore, it appears that in the Flavian era native noblemen were no longer permitted to command auxiliary units from their own tribe.|$|E
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
