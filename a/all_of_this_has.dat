25|$|The {{ecosystems}} of the Aral Sea and {{the river}} deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from weapons testing, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff. These substances form wind-borne toxic dust that spreads throughout the region. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and {{the people living in}} the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and health problems, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (most of which is drug resistant) and cancer, digestive disorders, anaemia, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. Liver, kidney, and eye problems can also be attributed to the toxic dust storms. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> resulted in an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable parts of the population: the child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns, and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women. The dust storms also contribute to water shortages through salt deposition, which has accelerated glacial melting to as much as 12 times the normal rate. The overuse of pesticides on crops to preserve yields has made this worse, with pesticide use far beyond health limits. Crops in the region are destroyed by salt being deposited onto the land, and fields are being flushed with water at least four times per day to try to remove the salinity from the soils. The dust storms make regional winters colder, and summers hotter.|$|E

Thompson's 1975 book At That Point in Time, in turn, accused Armstrong of having been too close to The Washington Posts Bob Woodward and of leaking committee information to him.

2500|$|In {{general the}} {{physical}} properties of natural materials cause limitations. Most dielectrics only have positive permittivities, ε > 0 [...] [...] Metals will exhibit negative permittivity, ε < 0 at optical frequencies, and plasmas exhibit negative permittivity values in certain frequency bands. Pendry et al. {{demonstrated that the}} plasma frequency {{can be made to}} occur in the lower microwave frequencies for metals with a material made of metal rods that replaces the bulk metal. However, in each of these cases permeability remains always positive. At microwave frequencies it is possible for negative μ to occur in some ferromagnetic materials. But the inherent drawback is they are difficult to find above terahertz frequencies. In any case, a natural material that can achieve negative values for permittivity and permeability simultaneously has not been found or discovered. Hence, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> led to constructing artificial composite materials known as metamaterials in order to achieve the desired results.|$|E
2500|$|The week-long {{practice}} that precedes {{the game is}} attended by key NFL personnel (including coaches, general managers and scouts), who oversee the players as possible prospects for pro football. At one point the Senior Bowl was the first chance its participants had to openly receive pay for participation in an athletic event. This was one reason that participation was limited to seniors whose eligibility for further participation in collegiate football had expired, and the game was also their first exposure to the slightly different professional rules. Players who wished to participate in collegiate spring sports had to avoid participation in the Senior Bowl. The significance of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> waned {{in recent years as}} there has been some lessening of the former strict separation of professional and amateur athletes. Athletes sometimes decline invitations to participate in the Senior Bowl, opting instead to prepare for the NFL scouting combine or their colleges' pro day. In 2013, two players (D. J. Fluker and Justin Pugh) with a year of college football eligibility remaining, but who had already graduated, became the first [...] "fourth-year juniors" [...] to be granted clearance to play in the Senior Bowl.|$|E
2500|$|The Bangladesh Liberation War (1971) {{resulted}} {{in one of}} the largest genocides of the 20th century. While {{estimates of the number of}} casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in Time magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated [...] "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred." [...] Senator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, [...] "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked [...] "H". <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.The Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Sydney Schanberg covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column [...] "The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored", he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. [...] "Other reminders were the yellow [...] "H"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army" [...] (by [...] "Muslim army", meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994).|$|E

2500|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the {{organization}} that regulates collegiate wrestling. The wrestling rules developed by the NCAA are followed by each of the NCAA's three divisions. In addition, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and the National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) have also adopted them, with some modifications. The NCAA generally sets the standard for weight classes for college-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. There are currently 10 main weight classes currently open to college-level competition, ranging from 125lb to the Heavyweight division that ranges from 183lb to 285lb. Also, there is a 235lb weight class, which only the National Collegiate Wrestling Association, {{the organization}} that governs college wrestling for institutions outside the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, currently allows that ranges from 174lb to 235lb. The NCWA also allows eight weight classes for women ranging from 105lb to 200lb. A wrestler must normally have his weight assessed {{by a member of}} the institution's athletics medical staff (e.g. a physician, certified athletic trainer, or registered dietician) before the first official team practice. [...] The weight assessed is then his minimum weight class. The athletics medical staff member and the head coach then review all of the assessed weights of the wrestling team members and certify them online at the website of the National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA). After the certification, the wrestler may not compete below that weight class and may only compete at one weight class higher than his minimum weight. If a wrestler does gain weight over his certified weight class and wrestles at two weight classes above it, he forfeits his previous lowest weight class for the one weight class below where he wrestled. If a contestant wishes to weigh-in and wrestle at only one weight class above his certified weight class and later return to his lowest certified weight class, he may do so. However, the wrestler may only return to that certified weight class according to the weight-loss plan of the National Wrestling Coaches Association. This weight loss plan takes into account potential dehydration during the wrestling season and minimum amounts of body fat. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been done in order to protect the wrestler's health and safety.|$|E
