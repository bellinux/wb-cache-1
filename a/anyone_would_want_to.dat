500|$|The pastime gained {{attention}} in a humorous article written by Don Katz, entitled [...] "King of the Ferret Leggers," [...] in the October 1987 issue of Outside magazine. Katz described ferrets as [...] "having claws like hypodermic needles and teeth like number 16 carpet tacks". James Howard of The Fresno Bee said Katz failed {{to explain why}} <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> participate in a sport such as ferret-legging, but the article [...] "offers {{a glimpse into the}} human need to challenge the edges of human endurance".|$|E

Often the daily distance travelled {{was little more than a}} single mile.|$|E
500|$|The band {{also showed}} {{disappointment}} with the ten songs {{that emerged from}} the sessions, as Hawkins described the finished tracks as [...] "million-dollar demos", and Grohl considered the recordings [...] "far too clean, too tame and boring". The band only liked five of the ten songs, and thought that listeners would enjoy the other five anyway. Grohl was afraid to promote the album because of his lack of confidence in it. After manager John Silva listened to the recordings, he agreed {{that it was not a}} work that represented the band well, and that [...] "we can release it now, but I don't know if <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy it".|$|E

500|$|Donkey Kong Jr. Math had a poor {{reception}} from IGN, with Lucas M. Thomas {{finding its}} controls poor and its execution to be bland and flawed, while AU's Cam Shea {{said it would}} be [...] "too expensive if it was free". Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games, finding it difficult to imagine any reason why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy it. GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an [...] "ironic smile" [...] as a reminder of the NES era, though he could not justify paying five dollars for it.|$|E
500|$|Ferber was {{at first}} shocked that <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern {{that he did not}} want to adapt it as the typical {{frivolous}} [...] "girlie" [...] show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work. Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, [...] "This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life..."Show Boat, with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E

2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, {{it sounds to me like}} the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> publish it".|$|E
2500|$|The Fence – In {{the early}} days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge which {{connected}} Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> meet at a fence. Administration was about to give up and tear it down but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition. The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as [...] "the Cut." [...] Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may [...] "take" [...] the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered [...] "the world's most painted object," [...] by the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E
2500|$|In Leonard Maltin's annual [...] "TV Movies" [...] ratings book, {{the film}} {{receives}} only two-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars, with the critique, [...] "Expensive remake of The Wages of Fear never really catches hold despite a few astounding scenes." [...] In Leslie Halliwell's Halliwell's Film Guide, the evaluation is even more harsh, and the author found the film [...] "truly insulting", going {{as far as to}} say: [...] "Why <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> spend 20 million dollars on a remake of The Wages of Fear, do it badly, and give it a misleading title is anybody's guess. The result is dire." [...] Andrew Sarris in his July 18, 1977, review for The Village Voice summarized the film as [...] "a visual and aural textbook on everything that is wrong with current movies," [...] as well as stating that the movie reset Friedkin's status to the beginning of his career, and compared him unfavourably to Clouzot, John Huston and David Lean, declaring that [...] "he has not come close to matching their craftsmanship." [...] Robert C. Cumbow in the September 1977 issue of Movietone News also panned the film, criticizing camera placement as [...] "faulty", which in his opinion led to substandard exposition. Moreover, he also deemed the film's editing [...] "ridiculous" [...] and thought Sorcerer lacked character involvement. John Marlowe of The Miami News assessed the movie's dialogues unfavourably, stating that [...] "Sorcerer's dialog is kept to such a minimum that not only you don't feel for these four losers, but you never really get to know them." [...] He also considered the film's mixture of realist and surrealist moments as [...] "pain in the mind". Peter Biskind described the film as [...] "self-consciously arty and pretentious [...] fatally trapped between America and Europe, commerce and art," [...] claiming the end result represented [...] "the worst of both worlds", as well as noting that the audience of the time was strikingly different from the one that adored The French Connection. Films Illustrated summarized Sorcerer as an inferior sequel, [...] "below the usual par", in spite of the involvement of reputable lead actor Scheider and a [...] "topnotch director", Friedkin. In the August 1997 issue of The Progressive, Kenneth Turan praised the movie's narrative set-up; however, he thought that in spite of it, it was impossible to attach oneself to the characters. He concluded the review by saying that with [...] "films like this, feeling is everything." [...] Gene Siskel claimed that the characters [...] "seem to be a little cold", as well as expressing an opinion that the special effects overpowered the protagonists.|$|E

5000|$|Rubin's biggest {{trademark}} as {{a producer}} has been a [...] "stripped-down" [...] sound, which involves eliminating production elements such as string sections, backup vocals, and reverb, and instead having naked vocals and bare instrumentation. However, by the 2000s, Rubin's style had been known to include such elements, as noted in The Washington Post: [...] "As the track reaches a crescendo and Neil Diamond's portentous baritone soars over a swelling string arrangement, Rubin leans back, as though floored by the emotional power of the song."
