5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn <b>and</b> <b>soybeans.</b> Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E

Meloidogyne incognita and Trichodorus christiei increased rapidly on corn and cotton, but were suppressed by peanut <b>and</b> <b>soybean.</b> More Pratylenchus spp. occurred on corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> than on cotton and peanut. Criconemoides ornatus increased rapidly on corn and peanut, but was suppressed by cotton <b>and</b> <b>soybean.</b> Helicotylenchus dihystera was more numerous on cotton <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> than on corn and peanut.

40|$|Rice, corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> is the {{strategic}} commodities {{and the government}} always maintains their availability.

Central Java is the main producer of rice, corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> with the contibution of Gross Regional Domestic Product of the food crop sub-sector to the highest Provincial GRDP in Indonesian. This research examines the competitiveness and the government policy towards rice, corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> farming in Central Java Province. It uses secondary data of Farming Economic Analysis from the relevant agencies and scientific publications on the international price of rice, corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> that is analyzed using the quantitative descriptive method with analysis tool of Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). The PAM result shows that the rice farming in Cilacap Regency and the corn farming in Grobogan Regency have competitive and comparative advantage. The soybean farming in Grobogan only has a comparative advantage. Overall the government policies are protective towards the rice farming in Cilacap, but not protective towards the corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> farming in Grobogan. The sensitivity analysis shows that the advantages and competitiveness of the rice farming in Cilacap and the corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> farming in Grobogan are sensitive towards the international price changes of commodities and fertilizers, the labor cost changes, the exchange rate fluctuations of Rupiah towards USD, and the import tariff changes of commodities. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCorn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> {{are among}} the major crops in the United States. Corn alone covers about 88 million acres, valued at $ 63 billion of which 20 percent is exported.  Adapting corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> {{production}} to a changing climate is a critical need as yields are affected by drought and excess water. We studied the effect of tillage, rotation and cover crop on corn (Zea mays L.) <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> (Glycine max) yields from 2011 to 2013. The study was conducted on a Waldron silty-loam soil at Lincoln University of Missouri's Freeman farm. Twenty four plots of each corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> were established on a 4. 05 ha field and arranged in a 3 -factor factorial design with 3 replications. The 3 factors (treatments) were tillage at two levels (no-tillage vs conventional tillage), cover crop at two levels (no-rye vs rye) and rotation at four levels (continuous corn, continuous <b>soybean,</b> corn/soybean <b>and</b> soybean/corn rotations). Corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> were planted each year in June and harvested in late October. Rye (Secale cereale) was planted in 12 plots of each corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> immediately after harvest. All corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> plots received 26 kg N, 67 kg P 2 O 5, and 67 kg K 2 O/ha. However, the corn plots received an additional 202 kg N/ha from urea. Overall, corn yield was significantly affected by year (p= 0. 001), but not tillage or cover crop. Soybean yield, however, was significantly affected by year (p= 0. 0001), tillage (p= 0. 0218) and cover crop (p= 0. 0531). In addition, on year per year basis, corn yield was significantly affected by tillage in 2011 while soybean yield was significantly affected by tillage and cover crop in 2011 and 2012 (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that cover crop may {{have an impact on}} soybean yield. The study is still being conducted for two more years and will hopefully provide more light on the effects of soil/crop management practices on the yields of corn <b>and</b> <b>soybean</b> in this silt loam soil...|$|R
