5|$|A parent's {{internal}} working {{model that}} is operative in the attachment {{relationship with her}} infant can be <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> examining the parent's mental representations. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} the quality of maternal attributions as markers of maternal mental representations can be associated with particular forms of maternal psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.|$|E
5|$|Both WWV and WWVH {{announce}} the Coordinated Universal Time each minute, and make other recorded announcements {{of general interest}} on an hourly schedule, including the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings. Since they share frequencies, WWV uses a male voice to distinguish itself from WWVH, which uses a female voice. WWV time signals can also be <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> telephone.|$|E

This requires continuous and coordinated efforts to support universities, academic libraries and researchers in achieving compliance...|$|R

5|$|The {{compartmentalization}} {{allows the}} cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns {{that must be}} removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.|$|E
5|$|The current {{version is}} in ID1 format and biometric. All 10 {{fingerprints}} and palmprints of the holder are taken, which {{is stored in}} paper files and {{which can only be}} <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> a judge in closely defined circumstances. A central database duplicates the information on the card, but strict laws limit access to the information and prevent it being linked to other databases or records.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of an}} {{associative}} array {{that allows}} data to be <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> its value rather than by its address {{dates back to the}} mid-1940s in the work of Konrad Zuse and Vannevar Bush, but hash tables were not described until 1953, in an IBM memorandum by Hans Peter Luhn. Luhn used a different collision resolution method, chaining, rather than linear probing.|$|E
5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> a ramp to the platform, is unstaffed, {{containing}} full height turnstiles and two staircases {{going up to the}} northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E

5|$|Their {{proximity}} to the main coast road means that the reserves can be <b>accessed</b> <b>by</b> bus as well as car. The Peddars Way National Trail runs {{the length of the}} SSSI, and only short sections of this part of the long distance footpath venture south of the SSSI boundary.|$|E
