5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we prospectively {{examined}} developmental {{trajectories of}} five <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom dimensions (generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> panic <b>disorder,</b> school <b>anxiety,</b> separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> and social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder)</b> from early to late adolescence {{in a community}} sample of 239 adolescents, assessed annually over 8 years. Latent growth modeling indicated different developmental trajectories from early into late adolescence for the different <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms, with some symptoms decreasing and other symptoms increasing over time. Sex differences in developmental trajectories were found for some symptoms, but not all. Furthermore, latent class growth analysis identified a normal developmental profile (including a majority of adolescents reporting persistent low <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms over 8 years) and an at-risk developmental profile (including a minority of adolescents reporting persistent high <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms over 8 years) {{for all of the}} <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom dimensions except panic disorder. Additional analyses longitudinally supported the validity of these normal and at-risk developmental profiles and suggested differential associations between different <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom dimensions and developmental trajectories of substance use, parenting, and identity development.

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether the self-report {{version of the}} Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR) could accurately identify individuals with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and individuals with the generalized subtype of social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> Furthermore, the study sought to determine the optimal cutoffs for the LSAS-SR for identifying patients with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and its generalized subtype. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-one patients with clinician-assessed social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (240 with generalized social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder)</b> and 53 control participants who were free from current Axis- 1 disorders completed the LSAS-SR. Results: Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses revealed that the LSAS-SR performed well in identifying participants with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and generalized social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> Consistent with Mennin et al. ’s [2002 : J Anxiety Disord 16 : 661 – 673] research on the clinician-administered version of the LSAS, cutoffs of 30 and 60 on the LSAS-SR provided the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for classifying participants with social anxiety and generalized social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> respectively.

5|$|<b>Anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and {{depression}} {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders, inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants {{in the treatment}} of generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> METHODS: All randomized controlled trials assessing the use of antidepressants in generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> up to may 2002 were included.

5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The age-at-onset {{criterion}} for separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> was removed in DSM- 5, making it timely {{to examine the}} epidemiology of separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> as a disorder with onsets spanning the life course, using cross-country data. Method: The sample included 38, 993 adults in 18 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health Surveys. The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview {{was used to assess}} a range of DSM-IV disorders that included an expanded definition of separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> allowing onsets in adulthood. Analyses focused on prevalence, age at onset, comorbidity, predictors of onset and persistence, and separation anxiety-related role impairment. Results: Lifetime separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> prevalence averaged 4. 8 % across countries (interquartile range [25 th- 75 th percentiles]= 1. 4 %- 6. 4 %), with 43. 1 % of lifetime onsets occurring after age 18. Significant time-lagged associations were found between earlier separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and subsequent onset of internalizing and externalizing DSM-IV disorders and conversely between these disorders and subsequent onset of separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> Other consistently significant predictors of lifetime separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> included female gender, retrospectively reported childhood adversities, and lifetime traumatic events. These predictors were largely comparable for separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> onsets in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood and across country income groups. Twelve-month separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> prevalence was considerably lower than lifetime prevalence (1. 0 % of the total sample: interquartile range= 0. 2 %- 1. 2 %). Severe separation anxiety-related 12 -month role impairment was significantly more common in the presence (42. 4 %) than absence (18. 3 %) of 12 -month comorbidity. Conclusions: Separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> is a common and highly comorbid disorder that can have onset across the lifespan. Childhood adversity and lifetime trauma are important antecedents, and adverse effects on role function make it a significant target for treatment...|$|R

In the first chapter, I introduce social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (SAD), describe cognitive behavioral therapy for SAD, review recruitment strategies to increase the representation of social minority groups in treatment research, discuss the importance of accurately reporting the social identities represented in samples, describe the particular relevance of stereotypes for social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> and provide a theoretically grounded rationale for the ways in which stereotype confirmation concerns may impact the experience and treatment of social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> For the second chapter, I present a study that examines {{the extent to which the}} demographic characteristics of participants (e. g., age, gender) are reported in treatment outcome research for social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> The findings from this study illuminate who participates in clinical trials for social anxiety (and therefore, to whom they may apply), as well as the infrequency with which some social identities are reported.
