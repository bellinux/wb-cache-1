40|$|At present German policy envisages {{interim storage}} of all {{radioactive}} waste (for approximately 30 years) until a final repository is available. This therefore leads to higher standards for storage containers. Silicone elastomers (polysiloxanes), materials {{on the basis}} of silicon and oxygen with organic substituents, have various physical and chemical properties and seem to be suitable for the long-term storage of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste. The aim of the present work is the qualification of a new coating material for storage containers. The use of polysiloxanes in other applications was also investigated. An important criterion for the coating is the simplicity of its application. Moreover, it should also have a high adhesion on steel as well as providing protection against corrosion. These properties were investigated for different polysiloxanes. The spraying tests showed that polysiloxane material with a viscosity of up to 45000 mPas could be applied by the <b>airless</b> <b>spraying</b> method. An elastic coating was produced which could ensure protection against mechanical impacts. In the framework of water vapour experiments, a very high diffusion constant was determined. The corrosion test confirmed that the polysiloxane coating provided only insufficient corrosion protection if the sample was in contact with water and water vapour at the same time. This problem was solved by using an additional priming coat of 60 micrometer zinc paint. The adhesion test showed that polysiloxanes have different levels of adhesion. The best adhesion was determined for condensation-cured silicones. The addition-cured materials had a lower adhesion, which was improved by the application of a priming coat. The outcome of these investigations is a wide spectrum of applications for polysiloxanes which can be used as firmly adhering coatings or removable decontamination layers...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} dermal {{exposure}} by spray painting has been investigated. After a pilot-study {{it was decided}} to start a study in the offshore industry, where the <b>airless</b> <b>spray</b> painting technique was used. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the range of potential dermal exposure to paint during <b>airless</b> <b>spray</b> painting. It was also investigated whether the observed exposure corresponds with the estimates made by the exposure model EASE. Skin exposure was measured in three offshore enterprises where a similar container was painted with use of the <b>airless</b> <b>spray</b> painting technique.

40|$|The discriminative {{power of}} {{existing}} dermal exposure models is limited. Most models only allow occupational hygienists to rank workers between and within workplaces according to broad bands of dermal exposure. No allowance {{is made for}} the work practices of different individuals. In this study a process-based, structured approach {{has been used to}} estimate dermal exposure from overspray generated by a spray painting process. Factors for spray technique, object shape and workers' individual work practices involved in the processes of droplet formation and deposition were incorporated into the model. The model was applied to predict dermal exposure of <b>airless</b> <b>spray</b> painters and the results were compared with exposure data. The predicted levels of exposure showed reasonable rank correlation with the measured exposure, although the model tended to over-predict the actual level of exposure. It was concluded that a structured, process-based approach has the potential to produce reliable estimates of dermal exposure. The reliability of exposure models of this type should be explored further and the relationship between the determinants of exposure should be validated by additional field studies.

50|$|The {{processing}} {{steps are}} very similar to those in hand lay-up. In this process, the release agent is first applied to the mould and then a layer of gelcoat is applied. The gelcoat is left for two hours, until it hardens. Once the gelcoat hardens, a spray gun is used to deposit the fibre resin mixture onto the surface of the mould. The spray gun chops the incoming continuous rovings (one or more rovings) to a predetermined length and impels it through the resin/catalyst mixture. Resin/catalyst mixing can take place inside the gun (gun mixing) or {{just in front of the}} gun. Gun mixing provides thorough mixing of resin and catalyst inside the gun and is preferred to minimize the health hazard concerns of the operator. In the other type, the catalyst is sprayed through two side nozzles into the resin envelope. <b>Airless</b> <b>spray</b> guns are becoming popular because they provide more controlled spray patterns and reduced emission of volatiles. In an airless system, hydraulic pressure is used to dispense the resin through special nozzles that break up the resin stream into small droplets which then become saturated with the reinforcements. In an air-atomized spray gun system, pressurized air is used to dispense the resin.|$|R

Therefore, linear motor operated multiple spray operations spray gun has been developed. This spray gun consists of two spray units, an air control and supply unit and a triggering unit to carry out the multiple spray operations.

From the analysis, dimensions and material selection have been optimized and finally the spray units have been fabricated and tested. During the performance test it is seen that satisfactory transfer efficiency of spray operation has been achieved by using newly developed spray housing of the spray units, which proves the stability of the spray housing during high pressure operation...|$|R

Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing rebar. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as terrazzo flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.Epoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds [...] Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats.

40|$|Although {{electrostatic}} spray {{technology has}} enjoyed phenomenal success in automotive painting and agricultural spray applications, many spray applications remain untouched by this technology due to technical and/or time constraint. One such high potential spray application {{is in the}} medical coating industry with strict requirements of high precision, high consistency, and considerable drug cost. Focusing further on medical stent coating, existing ultrasonic spray nozzles are wasteful and time-consuming in addition to added complexity of reclaiming the drug overspray. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that pressurized air and/or ultrasonic vibration which introduces much turbulence to spray droplets in flight. To further improve transfer efficiency and consistency of existing spray nozzles, SSCo has developed a new <b>airless</b> Electrostatic <b>spray</b> nozzle which relies solely on electrostatic charges accumulated in a unique spray tube design to gently applied coating material in a consistent and efficient manner. An added benefit is to have steady spray at flow rates ranging from 3 cc/hr- 10 cc/hr. An analysis of various spray tube tips is performed, each having different geometry making full use of Gauss' Law to concentrate electrostatic charge and maximizing electric field strength at terminal spray point. A particular point of interest will be how the droplet shape, distribution, and size are affected by the different designs. Lab testing indicated that the larger sharp edge areas where electric charge accumulates, the smaller the droplet size while droplet shape sphericity stays relatively constant. This is concluded from results showing that a spray tip with a circumferential corner area produces smaller droplets than that with 4 points. Furthermore, a spray tip with 4 points produces smaller droplets than that with 1 point. The results lead us to believe that some spray tip designs sufficiently charge the droplets reaching Rayleigh limit more efficiently...|$|R
