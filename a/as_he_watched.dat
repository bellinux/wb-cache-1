5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life {{in a way that would}} help others find courage.|$|E
5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three children}} were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{the title}} {{eventually}} brought the team to an end, as they began a losing streak caused by Hurricane's injuries. During the October 17, 2005, episode of Raw, Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. After the beating footage was shown, Hurricane ripped off his mask and struck Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, Hurricane did not show up for a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions Cade and Murdoch alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, now going by the name Gregory Helms <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> Rosey get double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up of being funny for the crowd, and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. On the November 7, 2005, episode, Helms defeated Rosey in their first encounter since teaming together.|$|E
5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} conveyed by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E

25|$|The {{first episode}} of Series Three was {{transmitted}} on Monday, 7 January 1980 at 7:15pm. Competition came from Coronation Street, game show Give Us a Clue and sitcom Keep {{it in the}} Family. Coverage of the Winter Olympics meant that the episode Children of Auron was shown on a Tuesday; the series returned to its regular time the following week. The series was watched {{by an average of}} 9.5million viewers. When the final episode, Terminal, was shown on 31 March 1980, the Blake's 7 production office had closed and the cast and crew had dispersed. They were surprised that, during the closing credits of Terminal, the continuity announcer declared that a new series of Blake's 7 would be shown the following year. The Head of BBC Television, Bill Cotton, was impressed by Terminal <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> its broadcast at home. He telephoned BBC Presentation and instructed that an announcement be made during the end credits that the series would return.|$|E

500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{worked with}} {{producer}} Ken Horton to create Smallvilles score. Snow composed music <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent {{the music to}} the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a [...] "typical action-adventure" [...] television show, [...] "the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} between the commanders reached its nadir during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945, when Jones grounded RAAF bomber squadrons scheduled {{to take part in}} the attack due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> for the Allied formations from a US warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck" [...] when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence. Over all, the dual system of control and the tension between its two senior officers confused the RAAF's efforts in the field and reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific.|$|E

500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] was {{completed}} by Jackson <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> cartoons with Paul McCartney. Producer Quincy Jones had initially told Jackson to write a song about two men fighting over a girl. Inspired, Jackson awoke during the night and sang the song into a tape recorder. He later said, [...] "I sang exactly what I heard in my head, starting with the melody and the keyboard and the strings and everything. So, I just orally put it all on tape." [...] Jones also asked Jackson to add a rap verse. The song was then recorded by Jackson and McCartney at Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, from April 14 to 16, 1982. The year before, the duo had recorded [...] "Say Say Say" [...] and [...] "The Man" [...] for McCartney's fifth solo album, Pipes of Peace (1983).|$|E

When Langley heard someone had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier.

500|$|Hurricane Dean passed [...] {{south of}} the Dominican Republic's capital, Santo Domingo, and {{although}} the island experienced relatively little wind, heavy rain flooded the streets. The moderate winds and heavy rains did not damage the agriculture sector as they did elsewhere in the Caribbean. Six deaths were attributed {{to the effects of}} the hurricane. [...] The strong wave activity on the southern coastline attracted a crowd of onlookers and a 16-year-old boy was swept out to sea and drowned <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> 16-foot (4.8m) swells break over a road in Santo Domingo. Also, five fishermen drowned in the northern Santiago province after their boat capsized due to the effect of wind and torrential rain in the Tavera Dam, near the town of Baitoa. The victims were fishing along with three others that managed to swim ashore, and were believed to have ignored warnings issued by civil defense authorities. Rough surf destroyed at least 5houses along the southern coast and damaged 316.|$|E

500|$|In a pre-release {{review of}} the film, Asahi Shimbuns Atsushi Ohara said that [...] "the film has adapted Dog of Flanders well", but he took issue with the {{treatment}} of Sota and Chibi, {{saying that they were}} treated too harshly. He rounded off his review by saying that the dog acted superbly and was very adorable, and that the scenery in the film had a rare beauty. In another article written by him, he said that the audience should [...] "expect to ponder about the events in this film", and finished by saying that the film allows the audience to gain important messages. In another pre-release review, Nobuko Yamasaki, writing on behalf of Moviewalker, said that Snow Prince was filled with [...] "tears of gratitude" [...] and Shintaro Morimoto's acting was lovely.

500|$|Responsible as CAS for {{building}} up Australia's air combat assets, in 1943 Jones had given an assurance to the Australian government {{that he could}} maintain a force of 73squadrons, despite Kenney's prediction that even the RAAF's then-currently approved strength of 45squadrons was beyond its capacity. In the event, {{by the end of}} the war Jones had expanded the RAAF to 70squadrons in the Pacific and Europe, including several heavy bomber units. One of his most controversial decisions of the war was during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945 when he grounded Australian B-24 Liberator squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack, due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted, and said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> the attacking formations from a U.S. warship, minus the expected RAAF aircraft. Kenney sympathised with him; he once commented in his diary that [...] "Jones and Bostock... fight each other harder than the Japs".|$|E
500|$|For {{four more}} days Bouvet's ships were {{battered}} {{by the high}} winds, none able to approach the shore without severe risk of being destroyed on the rocky coast. Losing their anchors as the cables snapped, many ships were forced to run before the wind and scatter into the Western Approaches. Others were destroyed: an American ship named Ellis, passing close to Crookhaven on 29 December, encountered a vessel wallowing in the waves, dismasted and with the deck strewn with bodies. The American captain, Harvey, reported that he approached the ship {{but was unable to}} assist her due to the storm and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched,</b> the ship was driven ashore and destroyed. This was the 44-gun frigate , of which only seven men survived from her complement of 550 crew and passengers.
