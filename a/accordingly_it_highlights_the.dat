The study of language contact with English in Japan is far from new in Japanese sociolinguistics, and {{a number of studies have}} been conducted in this area. However, I argue that previous studies are marked by two main oversights: firstly, previous studies were conducted on data collected from limited genres; secondly, in the previous studies, English was examined on the basis of a restricted contact setting. Thus, the earlier studies provided a limited view of {{the ways in which}} the use of English functions in the Japanese context, overlooking the variety of the ways in which new meanings and identities are created. This study provides a more comprehensive picture of the ways in which the use of English functions performatively within the Japanese setting. It does this by conducting three case studies on data collected from three largely overlooked genres of Japanese popular culture, namely Japanese rap, manga, and a Japanese online Bulletin Board System website (BBS). Drawing on the theoretical framework based on the concepts of globalisation and performativity (Pennycook, 2007), this study focuses on the dynamic process by which English is embedded and re-embedded in local contexts within Japanese popular culture. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>it</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> ways in which the use of English performatively creates and recreates new meanings and identities. This thesis argues that the process in which English is embedded is multidimensional within the Japanese context, and that this process corresponds to the ways in which English is performative in constructing multidimensional identities. Furthermore, viewing the use of language as a 'transmodal performance' (Pennycook, 2007), this study examines how the use of English works performatively in parallel with other modes of performative act, such as singing and drawing pictures.
