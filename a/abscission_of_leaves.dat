40|$|Reduction in petiolar auxin {{transport}} {{has been}} proposed {{as one of the}} functional actions of endogenous or exogenous ethylene as it regulates intact leaf abscission. If this hypothesis is correct, auxin-transport inhibitors should hasten the rate or amount of abscission achieved with a given level of ethylene. Evidence presented here indicates that the hypothesis is correct. Three auxin transport inhibitors promoted ethylene-induced intact leaf abscission when applied to specific petioles or the entire cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum L., cv. Stoneville 213). In addition, the transport inhibitors caused rapid <b>abscission</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> which usually do not abscise under the conditions employed. No stimulation of abscission occurred during the initial 3 to 5 days after plants were treated with transport inhibitors unless such treatments were coupled with exogenous ethylene or that derived from 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid. However, vegetative cotton plants did abscise some of their youngest true leaves during the 2 nd and 3 rd weeks of exposure to transport inhibitor alone. Taken as a whole, the results indicate that reducing the auxin supply to the abscission zone materially increases sensitivity to ethylene, a condition which favors a role of endogenous ethylene in abscission regulation. Such a role of ethylene indicates the importance of auxin-ethylene interactions in the over-all hormone balance of plants and specific tissues...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ethylene and the inhibitors of ethylene action, 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) and silver thiosulfate (STS) on the shelf life of potted 'Calypso' and 'MG 302 ' peppers.

Treatment of 20 - to 30 -day-old seedlings with thidiazuron at concentrations equal to or greater than 10 micromolar resulted in leaf abscission. At a treatment concentration of 100 micromolar, nearly total <b>abscission</b> <b>of</b> the youngest <b>leaves</b> was observed. Following treatment, <b>abscission</b> <b>of</b> the younger <b>leaves</b> commenced within 48 hours and was complete by 120 hours. A large increase in ethylene evolution from leaf blades and abscission zone explants was readily detectable within 24 hours of treatment and persisted until leaf fall. Ethylene evolution from treated leaf blades was greatest 1 day posttreatment and reached levels in excess of 600 nanoliters per gram fresh weight per hour (26. 7 nanomoles per gram fresh weight per hour). The increase in ethylene evolution occurred in the absence of increased ethane evolution, altered leaf water potential, or decreased chlorophyll levels. Treatment of seedlings with inhibitors of ethylene action (silver thiosulfate, hypobaric pressure) or ethylene synthesis (aminoethoxyvinylglycine) resulted in an inhibition of thidiazuron-induced defoliation. Application of exogenous ethylene or 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid largely restored the thidiazuron response. The results indicate that thidiazuron-induced leaf abscission is mediated, at least in part, by an increase in endogenous ethylene evolution.

Leaves of three peanut, Arachis sp., genotypes were inoculated with C. arachidicola. Two genotypes, `Tamnut 74 ' and PI 109839, produced ethylene and were defoliated. The third genotype, PI 276233, a wild species, did not produce ethylene above control levels and was not defoliated. Increase in ethylene production by Tamnut 74 and PI 109839 coincided with appearance of disease symptoms. Tamnut 74 produced the most ethylene, but PI 109839 was equally defoliated. Thus, less overall ethylene production did not necessarily indicate a more resistant genotype in this system unless ethylene production remained at control levels, as it did for PI 276233. Ethylene sufficient to initiate abscission could have been produced by the seventh day after inoculation when it was similar for both Tamnut 74 and PI 109839, but 3 to 4 times control amounts. This occurred before the rapid increase in ethylene production and before disease symptoms were visible. Silver ion, a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, was sprayed at three concentrations on intact Tamnut 74 plants. All rates reduced abscission and 150 mg/liter Ag(I) decreased abscission to below 10 %.

The pathogen colonized the cortex and the stele {{of plants and}} produced fertile pycnidia on infected roots. Symptoms on leaves allowed for greater discrimination in aggressiveness among isolates in comparison to symptoms on roots. No correlations were observed between the parameters measured on leaves and roots suggesting organ specialization in this pathogen. Phoma medicaginis infected leaves of alfalfa, pea, common bean and chickpea causing necrosis and tissue yellowing at 15 d post inoculation (dpi). Pycnidium production was observed on dead and dying foliar tissues of alfalfa, pea and common bean, but not on chickpea. The pathogen caused symptoms of collar rot and brown root discoloration on alfalfa, chickpea, pea and common bean, but did not cause symptoms on leaves or roots of lentil at 15 dpi. Phoma medicaginis was more pathogenic on barrel medic, the host of origin, {{in comparison to the}} other legumes, suggesting that these species are likely to be secondary hosts for this pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Recent {{studies showed}} a {{positive}} tree response to Na addition in K-depleted tropical soils. Our study aimed to {{gain insight into}} the effects of K and Na fertilizations on leaf area components for a widely planted tree species. Methods Leaf expansion rates, as well as nutrient, polyol and soluble sugar concentrations, were measured from emergence to <b>abscission</b> <b>of</b> tagged <b>leaves</b> in 1 -year-old Eucalyptus grandis plantations. Leaf cell size and water status parameters were compared 1 and 2 months after leaf emergence in plots with KCl application (+K), NaCl application (+Na) and control plots (C). Results K and Na applications enhanced tree leaf area by increasing both leaf longevity and the mean area <b>of</b> individual <b>leaves.</b> Higher cell turgor in treatments +K and +Na than in the C treatment resulting from higher concentrations of osmotica contributed to increasing both palisade cell diameters and the size <b>of</b> fully expanded <b>leaves.</b> Conclusions Intermediate total tree leaf area in treatment +Na compared to treatments C and +K might result from the capacity of Na to substitute K in osmoregulatory functions, whereas it seemed unable to accomplish other important K functions that contribute to delaying leaf senescence.

40|$|<b>Abscission</b> <b>of</b> cotyledonary <b>leaves</b> from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Stoneville 213) {{seedlings}} occurred following {{relief from}} water stress. The amount <b>of</b> <b>abscission</b> {{was related to}} the magnitude of the plant water deficit. Leaf abscission promoted by exogenous ethylene was enhanced in seedlings subjected to water stress. Treatment with ethylene (2. 0 to 3. 2 microliters of ethylene per liter of air for 24 hours) raised the threshold plant water potential required to induce abscission from — 17 to — 7 bar, indicating that the stress caused the tissue to become predisposed to ethylene action. Based on the abscission response curve for seedlings treated with ethylene while under water stress, this apparent predisposition was developed as the plant water potentials reached the — 7 to — 10 bar range. The abscission-promoting effects of ethylene in combination with water stress were reversed with 15 % CO 2 at plant water potentials above — 12 bar, but the CO 2 reversal was lost at lower water potentials. These results are compatible with the concept that ethylene plays a regulatory role in leaf abscission induced by water stress...|$|R
40|$|Ethephon {{promotes}} fruit abscission and accelerates {{harvest of}} macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia (Proteaceae), but has limited use due to concerns that associated <b>abscission</b> <b>of</b> inner-canopy <b>leaves</b> may reduce subsequent yield and nut quality. Yield and quality were monitored for 2 years following ethephon application to both unshaken and mechanically shaken {{trees of the}} late-abscising cultivar, A 16. Nut quality was not adversely affected in subsequent seasons, but effects on yield varied. In 3 of 6 experiments, ethephon reduced yield in the year after application. However, in 4 of the 6 experiments, 2 years of ethephon application greatly elevated yield in the third year. This was not a compensating recovery from low second-year yield, as third-year yield of trees that received only 1 ethephon treatment {{did not differ from}} yield of control trees. Ethephon-assisted harvest remains feasible for macadamia, although further work is warranted given the potential risks and considerable benefits for subsequent yield. Inner canopy defoliation, resulting from ethephon use, could represent a canopy management technique for dense-canopy fruit trees...|$|R
