5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials.

5|$|Though Operation Irma {{was widely}} publicized, and was {{reported}} in September 1993 to have raised £1 million in donations to evacuate the wounded from Sarajevo, it attracted a number of criticisms.

5|$|Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{described}} the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War. The incident {{came at a}} time of heightened political and social tensions between Muslim majority countries and Western countries, following several, high-profile Islamic terrorist attacks in the Westincluding the September 11 attacksand Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The cartoons and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> public.|$|E

25|$|Bobby Sands was {{the first}} of ten republican {{paramilitary}} prisoners to die during a hunger strike in 1981. There was widespread sympathy for the hunger strikers from Irish republicans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> nationalist community {{on both sides of the}} Irish border. Bobby Sands was elected as an MP to the UK's Houses of Parliament and two other hunger strikers, Paddy Agnew and Kieran Doherty, were elected to Dáil Éireann in the Republic of Ireland by electorates who wished to register their opposition to the UK Government's then policy. The ten men survived without food for 46 to 73 days, taking only water and salt, before succumbing. After the deaths of the men and severe public disorder, the Government granted partial concessions to the prisoners, and the strike was called off. The hunger strikes gave a huge propaganda boost to a previously severely demoralised Provisional IRA.|$|E
25|$|In {{the visual}} arts, late modernism {{encompasses}} the overall production of most recent art {{made between the}} aftermath of World War II and {{the early years of}} the 21st century. The terminology often points to similarities between late modernism and post-modernism although there are differences. The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is contemporary art. Not all art labelled as contemporary art is modernist or post-modern, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modern and late modernist traditions, as well as artists who reject modernism for post-modernism or other reasons. Arthur Danto argues explicitly in After the End of Art that contemporaneity was the broader term, and that postmodern objects represent a subsector of the contemporary movement which replaced modernity and modernism, while other notable critics: Hilton Kramer, Robert C. Morgan, Kirk Varnedoe, Jean-François Lyotard and others have argued that postmodern objects are at best relative to modernist works.|$|E
