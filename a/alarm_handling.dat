40|$|Static {{analysis}} tools have showcased their importance and usefulness in automated detection of code anomalies and defects. However, {{the large number}} of alarms reported and cost incurred in their manual inspections have been the major concerns with the usage of static {{analysis tools}}. Existing studies addressing these concerns differ greatly in their approaches to <b>handle</b> the <b>alarms,</b> varying from automatic postprocessing of alarms, supporting the tool-users during manual inspections of the alarms, to designing of light-weight static analysis tools. A comprehensive study of approaches for <b>handling</b> <b>alarms</b> is, however, not found. In this paper, we review 79 <b>alarms</b> <b>handling</b> studies collected through a systematic literature search and classify the approaches proposed into seven categories. The literature search is performed by combining the keywords-based database search and snowballing. Our review is intended to provide an overview of various <b>alarms</b> <b>handling</b> approaches, their merits and shortcomings, and different techniques used in their implementations. Our findings include that the categorized <b>alarms</b> <b>handling</b> approaches are complementary and they can be combined together in different ways. The categorized approaches and techniques employed in them can help the designers and developers of static analysis tools to make informed choices...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} part of most SCADA implementations is <b>alarm</b> <b>handling.</b> The system monitors whether certain alarm conditions are satisfied, to determine when an alarm event has occurred. Once an alarm event has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation {{of one or more}} alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the alarm event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the alarm conditions are cleared.|$|E

40|$|Alarms {{constitute}} a significant {{aspect of the}} operator-system interface in human supervisory control tasks: they {{have the potential to}} display information that is of critical importance to overall system safety and integrity. This paper considers the trend toward the use of visual display terminals for the presentation of alarms, specifically in the use of scrolling text displays. It is suggested that this form of information display may not best serve all aspects of <b>alarm</b> <b>handling.</b> To illustrate why this is so, an analysis of human <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> activities is presented. The focus on text-based displays and annunciators allows the authors to concentrate on a number of problems associated with the alarm design using a specific medium. From this discussion, the alarm initiated activities model is developed. By considering the activities that people engage in when dealing with alarms, an insight is offered into the information requirements {{that can be used to}} inform the design of alarm systems...|$|E
40|$|In TRIUMF' s Central Control System (CCS), <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> {{and other}} types of events are dealt with in a {{software}} " scan" package. Many changes that must be monitored are not considered as alarms because there is no action associated with the various values of the control variable and thus the software package was named to reflect the action of scanning the system for defined state changes. This scan package can issue messages to different logs and take actions as determined by the user. The initial requirements, design, implementation, and user interface are described. 1 Introduction During the upgrade of TRIUMF' s central control system, it became apparent that there is a significant amount of process monitoring and <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> that could be controlled and operated on by a single software package.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the selection of}} visual alarm formats for different 'alarm initiated activities'. The activities under examination were <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> tasks. Seven such tasks have been identified, namely: observe, accept, analyse, investigate, correct, monitor and reset. One {{of the most important}} stages is the initial analysis of the alarm information as this determines the subsequent manner in which the information is processed. It was hypothesised that the format in which the information is presented will determine the success of the <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> task, hence the proposal to match formats to tasks. The findings suggest that text-based formats are best suited to tasks requiring time-based reasoning, mimic formats are best suited to tasks requiring spatial location and annunciator formats are best suited to tasks requiring recognition of spatial patterns. The importance of considering both reaction time and accuracy of response in consideration of task match was also noted. In summary, it is suggested that care needs to be taken to determine the appropriateness of the medium for any given task and the demands it places on the human operato...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of highly reliable sensors and remote condition monitoring equipment {{will change the}} form and functionality of maintenance and engineering systems within many infrastructure sectors. Process, transport and infrastructure companies are increasingly looking to intelligent infrastructure to increase reliability and decrease costs in the future, but such systems will present many new (and some old) human factor challenges. As the first substantial piece of human factors work examining future railway intelligent infrastructure, this thesis has an overall goal to establish a human factors knowledge base regarding intelligent infrastructure systems, as used in tomorrow’s railway but also in many other sectors and industries. An in-depth interview study with senior railway specialists involved with intelligent infrastructure allowed the development and verification of a framework which explains the functions, activities and data processing stages involved. The framework includes a consideration of future roles and activities involved with intelligent infrastructure, their sequence and the most relevant human factor issues associated with them, especially the provision of the right information in the right quantity and form to the right people. In a substantial fieldwork study, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was employed to facilitate an understanding of <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> and fault finding in railway electrical control and maintenance control domains. These functions had been previously determined to be of immediate relevance to work systems in the future intelligent infrastructure. Participants in these studies were real railway operators as {{it was important to}} capture users’ cognition in their work settings. Methods used included direct observation, debriefs and retrospective protocols and knowledge elicitation. Analyses of <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> and fault finding within real-life work settings facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the use of artefacts, alarm and fault initiated activities, along with sources of difficulty and coping strategies in these complex work settings. The main source of difficulty was found to be information deficiency (excessive or insufficient information). Each role requires different levels and amounts of information, a key to good design of future intelligent infrastructure. The findings from the field studies led to hypotheses about the impact of presenting various levels of information on the performance of operators for different stages of <b>alarm</b> <b>handling.</b> A laboratory study subsequently confirmed these hypotheses. The research findings have {{led to the development of}} guidance for developers and the rail industry to create a more effective railway intelligent infrastructure system and have also enhanced human factors understanding of <b>alarm</b> <b>handling</b> activities in electrical control...|$|E

40|$|The Very Large Telescope (VLT) of ESO, under {{construction}} in the Atacama desert in Chile, consists of an array of four telescopes of 8 m diameter. The control software is inherently distributed, since {{it is based on}} LANs interconnecting several control workstations (WS) and specialized microprocessor boards (Local Control Unit, LCU). The workstation provide user interface and high level functions, while the LCUs handle real-time control. A basic layer of common software provides, on both workstations and LCUs, services for interprocess communication, synchronization among CPUs, On-Line Real Time Database, errors and <b>alarms</b> <b>handling,</b> events logging and booking of equipment for security and protection. On the workstation side, this software is based on the services given by Rtap, while on the LCUs specialized software implements all the necessary functionality with the same software interface. The On-Line Real Time Database is heavily distributed. Every unit in the system (WS or LCU) has its own hierarchical local database, where all the system parameters are stored and where real time data are collected. To help the database design, development and maintenance during the lifetime of the VLT project, the Rtap concept of “point configuration files ” has been extended introducing Object Oriented concepts. Using these extensions, a set of related points can be grouped in a class. This allows extensive reuse of common database structures defining instances of the classes or using inheritance to create new specialized classes. A pre-processor analyses the files that describe the database and generates “point config files ” in the standard Rtap format. Interactive tools are under development to provide the same functionality of the Rtap Database interactive tools, plus a full comprehension of the class and inheritance scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|The alarm {{monitoring}} system “BeamlineAlarminfoClient” {{is a very}} useful technical-service application at DESY, as it visually renders the locations of important alarms in some sections (e. g. fire or other emergencies). The aim of redesigning this application {{is to improve the}} software architecture and allow the easy integration of new observable areas including a new user interface design. This redesign also requires changes on server-side, where <b>alarms</b> are <b>handled</b> and the necessary alarm information is prepared for display. Currently, the client manages alarm data from 17 different servers. This number will increase dramatically in 2014 when new beam lines come into play.
