40|$|American law {{enforcement}} organizations have witnessed major changes {{during the last}} two decades. One of the changes is in reference to the personnel. Historically, {{law enforcement}} has been a strongly safeguarded white male occupation. This, however, has changed as racial minorities and women have won appointments to the ranks of this bureaucracy. African Americans, in a few cities, have attained numbers that are comparable to their representation in the city population. Women have surmounted major obstacles that served to question their competency and performance. The major impetus to change for these two groups has been affirmative action. White males have generally opposed this remedy and have sought to preclude its use. Partly because of this <b>attitude,</b> <b>law</b> enforcement agencies may be slow to implement affirmative action programs to increase the representation of blacks and women. This study examines the attitudes of law enforcement officers toward affirmative action. It specifically seeks to determine if attitudes vary with the socio-demographic background of officers. It was hypothesized that American law enforcement officers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes would vary according to race, gender, age, education, rank and region. These hypotheses are tested with data collected in 1981 evaluating the responses of criminal justice employees to affirmative action. The results of the study suggests that attitudes do vary with officer 2 ̆ 7 s characteristics. Specifically, black and women law enforcement officers are statistically significant more likely to support affirmative action. Additionally, it was found that officers that were younger, better educated, non-management, and residing outside the South, were supportive of affirmative action, though not statistically significant. ...|$|E
40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed September 8, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 111 - 114) This thesis examines the various ways that the perception of bankers and banking in Florence changed from the 13 th to the 15 th century. This topic is broken down into three categories, scholastic <b>attitude,</b> <b>law,</b> and public image, and utilizes a socio-intellectual style of historical inquiry. The {{purpose of this study}} is to demonstrate that the positive acceptance of banking from a formerly profane vocation was due to a more advanced understanding of industry and economics, a more relativistic interpretation of theological and juridical sources, and an aggressive campaign by the humanists to redefine moral values and to reshape the Florentine culture and urban landscape in order to bring esteem and power to the elite bankers. Many cultural themes are examined, including public attitudes toward wealth, profit, honor, and nature. Sociological analysis reveals the impact of banking on Florentine society, from rural farmers, middle-class artisanal workers, and members of the elite ruling class, as well as its relationships with ecclesiastical and civic institutions. Various types of banking are also investigated, including international exchange, money lending, pawn brokerage, and public finance. Finally, a variety of types of bankers are featured in this study, from the elite banking families such as the de' Medici, smaller scale bankers including the Jewish lenders, and the public lending institution known as the monte di piet??. Sources in this study range from ancient Greek and Roman philosophical texts, biblical sources, medieval moral and ecclesiastical treatises, and literary and intellectual discourses from the Renaissance. Secondary sources play an instructional and inspirational role in the development of this study, particularly the works of Richard A. Goldthwaite, Odd Langholm, and Lauro Martines. This study examines the Florentine perception of banking from a wide range of historiographical perspectives in order to trace the forces and agents that were responsible for its dramatic shift, from inexorable disapproval to dignified civic and cultural preeminence...|$|E

PERNILLA ELOFSSON MARIA AHLQVIST Elofsson, P. & Ahlqvist, M. How do social workers work with prostitution? A {{case study on}} social work in the work with prostitution and perspectives on the sex purchase law from social workers. A thesis in social work, 15 points. Malmö College of higher learning: Health and Society, The Unit of social work, 2009. Our purpose with {{this study is to}} examine how social workers describe the purpose and the ambition with social work targeting prostitution and how they see the opportunities to meet this ambition. We also want to examine what they think about the sex purchase law and the debate that have arisen around it in the recent years. Our issues are: What’s the goal and purpose of the work with prostitution and how are the social workers working to achieve it? How do social workers that work with prostitution reason about the sex purchase law and the debate about it that has been and is still going on? In order to answer our issues we have done qualitative interviews with social workers. One of them was a group interview with two social workers and the other was a case study with four social workers. The social workers in the group interview works with prostitution on the street. The social workers in the case study works with prostitution on the Internet and with the persons who buy sex. The interviews have focused on the social workers perspectives, thoughts and the reasoning about their work with prostitution and the sex purchase law. We’ve tried to create an understanding for what the sex purchase law has and the experiences from it have meant for their work. The theories we have used are social constructivism and queer theory. We’ve briefly {{come to the conclusion that}} it is clear what the social workers are supposed to do in their work with prostitution but not how there are supposed to do it. This creates an uncertainty in what direction they're working in. The social workers think that the debate about the sex purchase law isn’t leading anywhere and that the law has done both good and bad for the women that sell sex. They also think that the law is an <b>attitude</b> <b>law</b> that let’s the society know the difference between right and wrong but it creates categories of people, victim and offender...|$|E
