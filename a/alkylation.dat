5|$|Finally, Stephen G. Davies of Oxford has {{designed}} a chiral auxiliary that combines the functionality of the Weinreb amide {{with that of}} the Myers’ pseudoephedrine auxiliary, allowing diastereoselective enolate <b>alkylation</b> followed by facile cleavage to the corresponding enantioenriched aldehyde or ketone.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid {{is often}} used as a solvent for {{reactions}} involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts <b>alkylation.</b> For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged carbocation.|$|E
5|$|Aggarwal has {{developed}} an alternative method employing the same sulfide as above and a novel <b>alkylation</b> involving a rhodium carbenoid formed in situ. The method too has limited substrate scope, failing for any electrophiles possessing basic substituents due to competitive consumption of the carbenoid.|$|E
25|$|Steric {{hindrance}} can {{be exploited}} {{to limit the}} number of <b>alkylations,</b> as in the t-butylation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.|$|R

40|$|Rapid <b>alkylations</b> of thiols are {{performed}} in a packed-bed flow reactor where potassium carbonate acts as a heterogeneous base in anhydrous solvents at ambient temperature. The reaction also has a high efficiency as {{the removal of the}} solvent is the only work up required to isolate the product. The products {{can be used in a}} subsequent oxidation which was performed sequentially in semibatch mode. The <b>alkylations</b> of phenol and benzyl amine have been demonstrated on an array of bases, but higher temperatures and longer reaction times are required than with thiols...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in <b>alkylation,</b> hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrated}} form {{of aluminium}} chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, {{with the central}} aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This means that the hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs, and thus this cannot {{be used as a}} catalyst in Friedel-Crafts <b>alkylation</b> of aromatic compounds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkylation</b> {{reaction}} is more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because the {{reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E
50|$|Bu4NOH is {{a strong}} base that is used often under phase-transfer {{conditions}} to effect <b>alkylations</b> and deprotonations. Typical reactions include benzylation of amines and generation of dichlorocarbene from chloroform.|$|R

50|$|The {{transient}} iminium intermediate is chiral {{which is}} transferred to the reaction product via chiral induction. The catalysts {{have been used in}} Diels-Alder reactions, Michael additions, Friedel-Crafts <b>alkylations,</b> transfer hydrogenations and epoxidations.|$|R
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of <b>alkylation</b> of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of <b>alkylation</b> repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
25|$|Electrophilic <b>alkylation</b> {{of simple}} pyrrole is uncommon. <b>Alkylation</b> to form enones at C2 has been seen.|$|E
50|$|According to findings, electrophilic <b>alkylations</b> at free CN− occur {{preferentially}} at carbon, {{regardless of}} whether the SN1 or SN2 mechanism is involved and whether hard or soft electrophiles are employed. Preferred N attack, as postulated for hard electrophiles by the HSAB principle, could not be observed with any alkylating agent. Isocyano compounds are only formed with highly reactive electrophiles that react without an activation barrier because the diffusion limit is approached. It is claimed that the knowledge of absolute rate constants and not of the hardness of the reaction partners is needed to predict the outcome of <b>alkylations</b> of the cyanide ion.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{drawbacks}} of diorganozinc <b>alkylations</b> is that {{only one of the}} two alkyl substituents is transferred. This problem can be solved by using Me2SiCH2 (TMSM), which is a non-transferable group.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{application}} of PHOX ligands is in palladium catalysts used for enantioselective allylic substitutions. They {{are able to}} effect {{a wide range of}} substitiuations including allylic <b>alkylations</b> (Tsuji-Trost reaction), aminations and sulfonylations.|$|R
25|$|Research in {{the area}} of a solid {{catalyst}} for <b>alkylation</b> has been ongoing for many years. Numerous patents exist for different catalysts, catalyst supports, and processes. Lewis acids will catalyze the <b>alkylation</b> reaction (<b>alkylation</b> of isobutane with olefins was discovered using aluminum chloride promoted with HCl). Several of the current preferred solid catalysts use a salt of HF: either boron trifluoride (BF3) or antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).|$|E
25|$|An <b>Alkylation</b> unit {{is one of}} the {{conversion}} processes used in petroleum refineries. It is used to convert isobutane and low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propene and butene) into alkylate, a high octane gasoline component. The process occurs {{in the presence of a}} strong acting acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid (HF) as catalyst. Depending on the acid used, the unit takes the name of SAAU (Sulphuric Acid <b>Alkylation</b> Unit) or HFAU (Hydrofluoric Acid <b>Alkylation</b> Unit).|$|E
25|$|Friedel–Crafts <b>alkylation</b> {{involves}} the <b>alkylation</b> of an aromatic ring with an alkyl halide using a strong Lewis acid catalyst.

40|$|Acid {{activated}} Indian bentonite (AAIB) is {{an excellent}} catalyst for the esterification of long chain fatty acids with long chain alcohols. The ester constituents of spermaceti (whale wax) and an analogue of jojoba oil are obtained when the reactants with catalyst are exposed to microwave irradiation under solvent-free conditions. The Indian bentonite is used for such a reaction for the first time. The procedure is essentially pollution-free as virtually no waste material is produced. Esters can also be synthesized by solvent-free <b>alkylations</b> of carboxylic anions under microwave irradiation. A few solventfree <b>alkylations</b> of carboxylic anions have been reported using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a phase transfer catalyst under microwave irradiation...|$|R

25|$|Both SAAU and HFAU contain similar {{volumes of}} {{hydrocarbon}} with similar risks, but {{the risks associated}} with each acid are quite different. HF requires much stricter precautions because of its greater potential for harm (this is due to its lower boiling point and higher harmful potential). In light of this high risk, the American Petroleum Institute has issued a Recommended Practice specifically for HF <b>alkylation</b> units (API RP 751). This publication recommends that access to an HF <b>alkylation</b> unit be strictly limited due to the potential hazards of HF. No similar, specific safety document is required for sulfuric acid <b>alkylation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{crude oil}} {{generally}} contains only 10 to 40 percent of hydrocarbon constituents in the gasoline range, refineries typically use a {{fluid catalytic cracking}} unit (FCCU) process to convert high molecular weight hydrocarbons into smaller and more volatile compounds, which are then converted into liquid gasoline-size hydrocarbons. <b>Alkylation</b> processes transform low molecular-weight alkenes and iso-paraffin molecules into larger iso-paraffins with a high octane number. While FCCUs are a very common unit in modern oil refineries, it is not common for a refinery have an <b>alkylation</b> unit.

40|$|The {{development}} of efficient Friedel&# 8211;Crafts <b>alkylations</b> of arenes and heteroarenes using only catalytic amounts of a Lewis acid has gained much attention {{over the last}} decade. The new catalytic approaches described in this review are favoured over classical Friedel&# 8211;Crafts conditions as benzyl-, propargyl- and allyl alcohols, or styrenes, can be used instead of toxic benzyl halides. Additionally, only low catalyst loadings are needed to provide {{a wide range of}} products. Following a short introduction about the origin and classical definition of the Friedel&# 8211;Crafts reaction, the review will describe the different environmentally benign substrates which can be applied today as an approach towards greener processes.
