The {{potential}} flood risk {{caused by}} dam failure {{is often more}} severe and can behave very different to that of natural flooding events. The tragedy of dam failure is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> to Georgia <b>with</b> {{the failure of the}} Kelly Barnes dam near Toccoa Georgia which resulted in 39 deaths {{in the early hours of}} November 6 th 1977. Floodplain maps issued by FEMA only show the 1 % and 0. 2 % annual chance floods and assume all dams and culverts function perfectly and therefore the risk of dam break is often forgotten. Recent developments in the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) has included the addition of unsteady 1 -dimenstional hydraulic modeling and dam breach modeling. Gwinnett County’s recent flood study program and spatial database developments has provided steady state HEC-RAS models and supporting spatial data that have provided the foundation for the creation of unsteady HECRAS models for dam break analysis. The conversion from a steady state flood study model to a dynamic dam break model required some careful modifications to account for differences in flood routing methodologies between the two model states. These unsteady models have been used to simulate both sunny day failures and storm in progress failures at all 14 of Gwinnett County’s NRCS facilities. These models have enabled flood inundation maps to be created which include peak elevation, floodwave arrival time and floodwave time to the peak for both sunny day and storm in progress failures. This has identified homes and businesses at risk enabling emergency evacuation plans to be created. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|It {{is a great}} {{pleasure}} to publish this book, a collection of papers reporting the 11 thacademic forum of Urban Research Plaza held at the Multi-media room of Universitas Gadjah Mada on February 18, 2013. The contributors came from Japan and Indonesia. This academic forum was jointly organized by Urban Research Plaza Yogyakarta Sub-center of Universitas Gadjah Mada, Osaka City University, and Indonesia Institute of the Arts. The theme was 'Social Accessibility through Culture' This academic forum has drawn ou; attention into how locality should be tapped in our efforts to empower urban community in order that urban development can be adddressed more accordingly and effectively. The urban study in the mainstream of academic society was clearly established as a global study, and nowadays, it is growing alongside urban social problems, which are becoming <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> for countries <b>with</b> ongoing urban development. The local government normally addresses urban social problems, sometimes with limited financial support from government at a higher level. Recent increasing interests have been shown in participatory arts programs, which are low-cost, flexible, and responsive to local needs. This use of arts and cultural activity coincides with a shift in the emphasis in regeneration strategies towards seeing local people as the principal asset, through which renewal can be achieved. In today's world, there is an emerging trend to decentralize the investment, operation, and maintenance of publi c services to the lower levels of the government. However, the transfer of responsibilities to local governments is not always matched with necessary resources. Financing urban infrastructure development is a common and persistent challenge to the local or city governments across the world. There is a growing support for the view that real improvements in urban development will not be achieved until the issue of people empowerment is. addressed. However, if empowerment is defined as a grassroots political process, which results in a redistribution of power in society, urban development should take into account the locality and sites as substantive examples of people'" empowerment. The unsheltered property of human beings in the form of intangible property such as knowledge, trust, shared understanding and beliefs, values and other factors can be made as took that enable members of urban society to improve their quality of life. Those arguments are the base why research and discussion on social accessibility through culture are important issue in urban research context. This conference aimed at developing interdisciplina ry perspective to inform activities in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors as well as future research {{to improve the quality of}} social life in urban communities. The forum was divided into two sessions. The papers presented in this book are from Universitas Gadjah Mada: written by lka Putra, Mimi Savitri, Jujun Kurniawan, Ario Wicaksono, from Indonesian Institute of the Arts: written by Alfi Luviani, Retno Mustikawati, and form Osaka City University: written by Tomoko Hayashi, Banban Li...|$|R

[...] Easton went on to state [...] "While maybe a bit unoriginal in plotting, this episode was still adequately spooky and disturbing, {{particularly with regard to}} the violent actions carried out by the youngsters." [...] Easton finished her review with [...] "On the surface, this episode of SVU may seem like a simple tale of young girl's devotion gone awry, but once again it's the undercurrent of the installment, filled with various incarnations of complicated issues, the main one of which seems to be who do you trust and at what level, that make this a satisfying episode." [...] Bill Bodkin of Pop-Break gave the episode a 8 out of 10 rating and stated [...] "'Glasgowman's Wrath,' despite the awful name, is a terrifically acted, tense and well thought out episode." [...] Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy of The Guardian said [...] "It is an episode beautifully aware of its own narrative devices, using its storytelling prowess to call attention to our cultural lust for violence and our deliberate repression {{of the fact that the}} greatest evils may not take our forms of choice."
