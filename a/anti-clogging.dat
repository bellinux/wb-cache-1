50|$|In {{materials}} science, galfenol is {{the general}} term for an alloy of iron and gallium. The name was first given to iron-gallium alloys by United States Navy researchers in 1998 when they discovered that adding gallium to iron could amplify iron's magnetostrictive effect up to tenfold. Galfenol is of interest to sonar researchers because magnetostrictor materials are used to detect sound, and amplifying the magnetostrictive effect could lead to better sensitivity of sonar detectors. Galfenol is also proposed for vibrational energy harvesting, actuators for precision machine tools, active anti-vibration systems, and <b>anti-clogging</b> devices for sifting screens and spray nozzles. Galfenol is machinable and can be produced in sheet and wire form.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{hydraulic}} property of drip emitters is primarily reflected in steady dissipation of pressure energy by flow resistance. The dentate path helps in dissipating energy as water {{travels to the}} emitter opening and maintains a turbulent flow condition that facilitates movement of particulate material out of system to avoid clogging. in this study, emitters were designed using variable geometric parameters. The visualisation characteristics of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilised for analysing the law of impact on flow movement by the path width (1. 6, 1. 3, 1. 0, 0. 6 mm), dentate height (1. 0, 1. 3, 1. 6, 2. 0 mm) and dentate angle (32 °, 41 °, 53 °, 63 °) and revealed the correlation relationship between the dentate structure of flow path of emitters and energy dissipation. meanwhile, an <b>anti-clogging</b> analysis was conducted.

The rear of dentations and dentate tips were the primary regions for energy dissipation. The flow exponent with both dentate height and path width being 1. 3 mm was minimum and the boundary flow velocity was maximum, i. e., there was good hydraulic performance and sound <b>anti-clogging</b> capacity. larger dentate angles had an active role in enhancing hydraulic performance but with a poor <b>anti-clogging</b> property. adjusting dentate jet effect by modifying the boundary structure of dentate flow paths could improve the inner flow pattern, enhance pressure energy dissipation, and improve boundary flow velocity, which was the key to enhancing {{hydraulic property}} and <b>anti-clogging</b> property within flow path of emitters...|$|E

Diatomite with characteristic of abrasiveness and porous structure seems to have potential in order to remove the clogging materials that mainly consists of soils. This study aims to investigate the effects of diatomite as <b>anti-clogging</b> agent on the permeability rate and strength of porous asphalt. The porous asphalt samples were prepared using Malaysia aggregate gradation and polymer modified bitumen of PG 76 was used as the binder.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Marginal soils can be {{improved}} by introducing permeable geosynthetics as drainage layers. However, clogging of the geotextile pores causes significant reduction in drain capacity, which {{in the long run}} affects stability of the earth structures built up with poorly drained backfills. This paper reports performance of a geosynthetic drain layer placed within two fine-grained soil slurries. A multipurpose consolidation test device has been developed for this purpose. Test results demonstrated that thick geocomposite layers are good enough in draining out water escaped during consolidation. In order to reduce clogging, a combination thin sand mat and geosynthetic drain layer, which is called hybrid system, has been tested. Thin sand mat has been found effective in preventing finer grains from clogging the geocomposite layer. Bearing capacity tests on model embankments proved that hybrid system generates frictional interaction with the rough surface of the geocomposite. This study shows that hybrid system performs well as <b>anti-clogging</b> drain layer within fine-grained soil. ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{reclaimed}} wastewater for crop irrigation is {{a practical}} alternative to discharge wastewater treatment plant effluents into surface waters. However, biofouling {{has been identified as}} a major contributor to emitter clogging in drip irrigation systems distributing reclaimed wastewater. Little is known about the biofilm structure and its influence on clogging in the drip emitter flow path. This study was first to investigate the microbial characteristics of mature biofilms present in the emitters and the effect of flow path structures on the biofilm microbial communities. The analysis of biofilm matrix structure using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that particles in the matrix of the biofilm coupled extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and formed sediment in the emitter flow path. Analysis of biofilm mass including protein, polysaccharide, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) showed that emitter flow path style influenced biofilm community structure and diversity. The correlations of biofilm biomass and discharge reduction after 360 h irrigation were computed and suggest that PFLAs provide the best correlation coefficient. Comparatively, the emitter with the unsymmetrical dentate structure and shorter flow path (Emitter C) had the best <b>anti-clogging</b> capability. By optimizing the dentate structure, the internal flow pattern within the flow path could be enhanced as an important method to control the biofilm within emitter flow path.

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} solve the problem of water {{shortage}} in agriculture, it’s necessary to develop water-saving irrigation. Drip Irrigation is a method of applying uniform and precise amount of water directly to the root zone of the plants as per the requirement, through emitters at frequent intervals over a long period of time, via pressure pipe network. As the key device in drip irrigation systems, the emitter is to drip the pressured water in the pipeline to the root of the crops evenly and steadily, so as to guarantee the water demand for crop growth. The quality of the emitter has an important effect on the reliability, life span of the drip irrigation system and irrigation quality. Usually, the structure of the emitter channel is very complex with a dimension. Emitter’s intricate inner channel makes the flow of water have turbulent behavior. In the design of emitter structure, we use 3 D parametric CAD software SolidWorks 2012 to design labyrinth emitter. According to emitter’s hydraulic performance and its requirement for <b>anti-clogging,</b> we can design new channel structures by changing those dimensions. The irrigation quality of drip irrigation system is verified by emitter’s hydraulic performance. In the high-pressure pipeline, the water energy may dissipate after flowing through the labyrinth channel and the flow rate can be controlled to meet the water need of the crops. To ensure the emitter’s hydraulic performance, before the fabrication of emitter, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to predict emitter’s flow rate and analyze its hydraulic performance under various water pressures...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was carried out}} to study the emitter performance of three commonly used emitter types with the application of freshwater and treated sewage effluent (TSE). The three emitter types are the inline-labyrinth types of emitters with a turbulent flow (E 1) and a laminar flow (E 2) and the online pressure-compensation type of emitters (E 3). The qualities of freshwater and TSE were measured, and the emitter performance was evaluated, using the relative emitter discharge, the reduction of emitter discharge (qreduction), the coefficient of variation of emitter discharge (CV), the emission uniformity (EU), Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU), {{and the percentage of}} emitter clogging (Pclog). Results showed that all indices were affected by water quality, emitter type and time of operation. The values of qreduction, CV and Pclog for the TSE treatments were greater than those for the freshwater treatments. The values of EU and CU for the TSE treatment were lower than those for the freshwater treatments. The qreduction, CV and Pclog increased and the EU and CU decreased as operational time increasing for the TSE treatment. For both freshwater and TSE treatments, the emitter clogging was more severe, the CV was greater, and the EU and CU were smaller for emitter type E 2 than those for emitter types E 1 and E 3. Thus a more severe clogging was found for emitter type E 2 due to its smaller flow-path dimension and higher manufacturing coefficient of variation in addition to the high pH values and relatively high total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the used water. Analyses of water quality and the precipitation components inside and at the outlet of emitters revealed that chemical precipitation was the main reason for emitter clogging due to high pH and ions' concentration, especially in the TSE. Flushing emitters and drip pipes did not efficiently alleviate emitter clogging caused by chemical precipitation. In a conclusion, emitter type E 3 showed a better <b>anti-clogging</b> function than emitter types E 1 and E 2 and was recommended for irrigation with TSE in the Beijing area of China.
