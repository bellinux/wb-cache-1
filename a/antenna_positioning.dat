40|$|An {{open area}} test site (OATS) is a {{facility}} to measure radiated emissions of an electrical or electronic equipment {{in order to}} comply electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements.

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{practical}} implementation of multiple antenna systems for mobile communications has recently gained {{a lot of}} attention. Due to the area constraint on a mobile device, {{the problem of how}} to design such a system in order to achieve the best benefit is still a huge challenge. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal <b>antenna</b> <b>positions</b> on a mobile device. Two cases of 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 MIMO systems are undertaken.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose to {{partially}} integrate the <b>antenna</b> <b>positioning</b> (APP) and frequency allocation problems (FAP). The traditional wireless network design process examines these two major issues sequentially {{in order to avoid}} the very high complexity associated with the simultaneous resolution of the two problems. The proposed integration involves the introduction of interference protection guarantees within the APP. It is customary to define such guarantees in an intermediate step and to use them as input to FAP, in order to protect against interference in critical areas. The proposed approach consists of selecting these protections while solving the APP, allowing the optimization procedure to exploit the degrees of freedom that this would offer. Results on two real-life problem instances indicate a significant improvement in interference levels and resource utilization.

40|$|The most {{important}} feature of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks is their dynamic behavior. Increasing the number of antennas on a mobile node can result in complex antenna movement. This {{gives rise to a}} decrease in the system gain, causes more delay, and further the network throughput may decrease especially when the network load becomes heavy. Since an antenna on a mobile node can result in complex antenna movement, in this paper, Enhanced <b>Antenna</b> <b>Positioning</b> System (EAPS) was used to improve the performance gain. Performance gains were compared between the results obtained when using Isotropic antenna and when using the EAPS through simulations in OPNET.
