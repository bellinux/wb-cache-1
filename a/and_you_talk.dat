It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in the same room <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> yourself into doing another series." ...|$|E
2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know {{there are so many people}} out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Lady Deringham {{did nothing}} of the sort," [...] she replied. [...] "Do you {{remember}} last time when you were down you took me for a walk once or twice <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> {{to me in the}} evenings, and--but perhaps you have forgotten. Have you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! Iduna, my life {{depends upon}} a word, {{which you will}} not speak, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of generosity. No! Iduna, it is not I that I am ungenerous." ...|$|E

6000|$|Godfrey {{gazed at}} her; he listened with parted lips, incredulous and appalled. [...] "You invented such a tissue of falsities and calumnies, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about your conscience? You stand there in your senses and {{proclaim}} your crime?" ...|$|E
