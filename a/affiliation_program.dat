50|$|In the 1890s, Harper, {{fearful that}} the vast {{resources}} of the University of Chicago would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, established an <b>affiliation</b> <b>program</b> with several regional colleges and universities, including Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler College, and Stetson University. Under {{the terms of the}} affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the University of Chicago; to notify the University early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals; to make no faculty appointment without the University of Chicago's approval; and to send copies of examinations to the University for suggestions and improvements prior to distribution. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; to provide special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and to provide a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press to the libraries of the affiliated schools at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it required uncompensated additional labor from them and cheapened Chicago's academic reputation. After Harper's death in 1906, the program was gradually discontinued, and it had passed into history by 1910.|$|E

"In {{a survey}} conducted over 34 years ago, Hare and Hemion (1968) found that United States drivers underuse their high beams in circumstances in which their use is recommended. High-beam use was also found to be inversely related to traffic density. Since that time, changes in beam pattern design, dimming controls, and perhaps driver awareness of the hazards of limited visibility may have sufficiently altered the situation to warrant a follow-up investigation. A survey of high-beam headlamp use was conducted on three unlit local roadways in the Ann Arbor area. Observers judged whether vehicles that were clear of both oncoming and preceding traffic had their high or low beams turned on. Illuminance measures at approximate beam pattern locations were also recorded to support beam judgments. In addition, traffic density was estimated over 15 -minute intervals so {{that the relationship between}} beam use and traffic density could be examined. The results suggest that the pattern of high-beam underuse is similar to that observed in the late 1960 s...|$|E

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 28) Four otherwise identical sedans had an infrared-reflective (IRR) film {{applied to}} differing {{sections of the}} vehicles’ glazing. An experiment was performed using two independent variables: air conditioning output (two different settings) and IRR film placement (windshield and front side windows, windshield only, front side windows only, and no IRR film applied). Dependent variables included subjective assessments of thermal comfort as well as objective measures of skin temperature and cabin air temperature. Presence of the film significantly decreased skin temperature and cabin air temperature. Not surprisingly, {{the magnitude of this}} effect was larger in those conditions where larger surface areas of film were applied. Presence of the film was also associated with a significant increase in subjective assessments of thermal comfort, an increase that appeared to be at least partly independent of the air temperature inside the vehicle. That is, for any given air temperature subjective ratings of thermal comfort were better in those conditions in which the IRR film was applied. The data from this study support the conclusion that IRR treatment can reduce the time required to reach comfort during vehicle cool-down. Further research should examine the relationship between subjective ratings of thermal comfort and the reduction in radiant heat that is associated with IRR treatment...|$|E

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 11) Institute for the University of Michigan Industry <b>Affiliation</b> <b>Program</b> for Human Factors in Transportation SafetyLight that {{is reflected}} or scattered {{from a vehicle}} windshield toward {{the eyes of a}} driver creates a veiling luminance that the driver must look through in order to see the roadway ahead. At night, scattered light is probably the dominant contributor to this effect, but for daytime conditions most attention has been given to the component of veiling luminance caused by images of the top of the dashboard seen by specular reflection in the windshield. This study was designed to provide data on real-world values of: (1) the overall veiling luminance that drivers are exposed to under sunny daytime conditions, and (2) the relative contributions to that luminance from specularly reflected and diffusely scattered light. We made photometric measurements of the veiling luminance caused by the windshields of 18 vehicles under sunny conditions. Illuminance on the outer surface of the windshield averaged 88, 900 lux, and under those conditions the total veiling luminance from the windshield averaged 561 cd/m 2. Of that total, about 60 % was attributable to reflection and about 40 % to scatter. Thus, under the conditions examined here, although the contribution from scatter is not negligible, reflection causes the majority of veiling luminance, and measures that would reduce reflected luminance potentially offer substantial benefits. Directions for further research include sampling wider ranges of vehicles and of sun angles, and better quantification of the overall importance of windshield veiling luminance for driver vision in the daytime...|$|E
