25|$|The surveys, {{which were}} given more {{significance}} by standard marketing {{procedures of the}} era, were less negative and were key in convincing management to change the formula in 1985, {{to coincide with the}} drink's centenary. But the focus groups had provided <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to how the change would play out in a public context, a data point the company downplayed but which proved important later.|$|E
500|$|The {{texts of}} Mari {{show that the}} cult of stones, {{especially}} the [...] "sikkanum" [...] (i.e., Betyles—sacred stones), was widespread in western Syria, and its practice in Qatna is plausible. Du Mesnil du Buisson named room F in the royal palace [...] "Haut-Lieu" [...] and considered it a shrine of Ašera. Research done after 1999 ruled out du Mesnil du Buisson's hypothesis {{and concluded that the}} room is a bathroom, but further research showed that the bathroom interpretation must also be wrong. Pfälzner, based on its architecture being suitable for containing sacred stones, suggested that room F was the palace shrine for the cult of Betyles. Pfälzner concludes that [...] "an ultimate proof, however, for the function of Room F at Qaṭna cannot be deduced from this parallel. Nor is there <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to the dedication of the possible Betyle-sanctuary at Qaṭna".|$|E

500|$|Throughout August 2011, the Carowinds {{web site}} had six {{different}} QR codes, {{each of which}} led the user to a website giving <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to what the 2012 attraction might be. When all six clues were put together, they made a picture that read [...] "Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters, fun soars to new heights... August 24". On August 24, 2011, it was officially announced that Carowinds would receive the fifth WindSeeker, and on September 1, 2011, Kings Dominion officially announced that the sixth would open at the park in 2012. The WindSeekers at Carowinds and Kings Dominion {{will have the same}} appearance as those at Canada's Wonderland, Cedar Point, and Kings Island and are expected to open in 2012. Their construction started in early November 2011, after the parks closed for the season. At Kings Dominion, El Dorado was removed {{at the end of the}} 2011 season to make room for WindSeeker. The first WindSeeker tower piece was installed there on January 20, 2012, and at Carowinds on January 23, 2012. Carowinds soft-opened their version on March 30, 2012 to media and invited guests; it opened to the public on March 31, 2012. Kings Dominion officially opened their model on April 6, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Act 2 {{opens on}} another Sunday afternoon, with Helena and Alison making lunch. In a two-handed scene, Alison gives <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to why {{she decided to}} take Jimmy on—her own minor {{rebellion}} against her upbringing plus her admiration of Jimmy's campaigns against the dereliction of life in postwar England. She describes Jimmy to Helena as a [...] "knight in shining armour". Helena says, firmly, [...] "You've got to fight him".|$|E
2500|$|One can get <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> {{to whether}} {{bleeding}} {{is due to}} [...] a platelet disorder or a coagulation factor disorder by the characteristics and location of the bleeding. All of the following suggest platelet bleeding, not coagulation bleeding: the bleeding from a skin cut such as a razor nick is prompt and excessive, but can be controlled by pressure; spontaneous bleeding into the skin which causes a purplish stain named by its size: petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses; bleeding into mucous membranes causing bleeding gums, nose bleed, and gastrointestinal bleeding; menorrhagia; and intraretinal and intracranial bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|This {{incarnation}} of Match Game was played with rules {{similar to that}} of the 1973–82 versions with a few exceptions. The show featured a panel of only five celebrities instead of the usual six. Questions in this version were not labeled A or B; instead titles with puns were <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to the content. As on the 1990–91 version, all five panelists played each round regardless of whether they matched a contestant on the first question; correct matches in the second round were worth two [...] "points" [...] while those in the first were awarded one.|$|E
2500|$|The eight {{possible}} {{abbreviations for}} a position on a compass, e.g., NNW (north-northwest) or ESE (east-southeast), occur with some frequency. They can be <b>clued</b> <b>as</b> simply [...] "Compass point", where the desired answer is determined by a combination of logic—since the third letter can be only E or W, and the second letter can be only N or S— and a process of elimination using checks. Alternatively, compass point answers are more frequently <b>clued</b> <b>as</b> [...] "XXX to YYY direction", where XXX and YYY are two place names. For example, SSW might be <b>clued</b> <b>as</b> [...] "New York to Washington DC dir". Similarly, <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> such <b>as</b> [...] "Right on the map" [...] means EAST. <b>A</b> <b>clue</b> could also consist of objects that point a direction, e.g., [...] "vane dir." [...] or [...] "windsock dir.".|$|R
50|$|Intabulations are an {{important}} source of information for historically informed performance because they show ornaments as they would have been played on various instruments, and they are <b>a</b> huge <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to the actual performance of musica ficta, since tablature shows where a musician places their fingers, which is less up to interpretation than certain staff notations.|$|R
5000|$|Portions of phrases are {{occasionally}} used as fill in {{the blank}} clues. For instance, [...] "Et tu, Brute?" [...] might appear in <b>a</b> puzzle's <b>clue</b> sheet <b>as</b> [...] "_____, Brute?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Camille Paglia {{states that}} {{there is nothing in the}} poem that would provide <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to whether the poem is {{directed}} towards a man or a woman, but assumes, as many do, that Sonnet 29 was written about the young man. Both Paglia and Frank agree that the first octave is about the Speaker's current depression caused by his social ostracism in his [...] "outcast state" [...] (line 2) and personal misfortune that has [...] "curse my fate" [...] (line 4). The Speaker proclaims his jealousy of those that are [...] "rich in hope" [...] (line 5) and [...] "with friends possess'd" [...] (line 6), once again referring to his hopelessness and low social status. Paglia refers to this section of the poem as a [...] "list of half-imaginary grievances." [...] Frank seems to agree with her statement of [...] "half imaginary" [...] since he believes the Speaker wills his own misery.|$|E
2500|$|Following Hanna's orders, {{the three}} car bombs (two of them escorted by a [...] "scout" [...] car, {{to be used}} for the bombers' escape back across the Northern Ireland border) were driven into the city centre of Dublin where they detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, almost {{simultaneously}} at approximately 5.30pm. No warnings were given. From the available forensic evidence derived from material traces at the scene, the bombs are believed to have contained, as their main tertiary explosive a gelignite containing ammonium nitrate, packed into the usual metallic beer barrel container used by loyalists in prior car bombings. Twenty-three people were killed outright in the blasts, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child; three more people would later die of their injuries. The bodies of the dead were mostly unrecognisable. One girl who had been near the epicentre of the Talbot Street explosion was decapitated; only her platform boots provided <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to her sex.|$|E
2500|$|The {{car bombs}} detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, at 5.28 p.m., 5.30 p.m. and 5.32 p.m. respectively. No {{warnings}} had been given. According to military experts, {{the placement of}} the car bombs indicated [...] "highly-intelligent military planning by people who knew what they were doing". One of the Irish Army's top bomb disposal officers, Commandant Patrick Trears, declared that the bombs were constructed so well that one hundred per cent of each bomb exploded upon detonation, resulting in the deaths of 26 people, mostly women (including one who was nine-months pregnant). Most of the dead were blasted beyond recognition; one girl who had been near the epicentre of the Talbot Street explosion was decapitated and only her platform boots provided <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to her sex. Close to 300 people were injured, many maimed for life. After the blasts the bombers fled from central Dublin in the scout cars and headed back north using the [...] "smuggler's route" [...] of minor and back roads, crossing the Northern Ireland border near Hackballs Cross, County Louth at about 7.30 p.m. Thirty minutes earlier, a fourth car bomb, delivered by a team from the Mid-Ulster UVF's Portadown unit, had exploded in Monaghan, killing an additional seven people. Samuel Whitten was allegedly the driver of the car.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> first <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to {{the actual}} {{complexity}} {{of the system of}} coagulation was the discovery of proaccelerin (initially and later called Factor V) by Paul Owren (1905–1990) in 1947. He also postulated its function to be the generation of accelerin (Factor VI), which later {{turned out to be the}} activated form of V (or Va); hence, VI is not now in active use.|$|R

2500|$|Early {{accounts}} of the attack state that the defenders [...] "failed to safeguard the perimeter" [...] of the FSB. The only single volume study written about the attack contests this position, pointing out that [...] "historians [...] got it wrong." [...] Even with this new perspective, {{there are indications that}} alertness at Mary Ann was not as good as it could have been. Many accounts by men stationed at Mary Ann mention that perimeter security was uneven at best. One member of the 1-46th Headquarters Company stated that [...] "I don't think Captain Knight [...] had <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to how lax the security was...because in that area, and only that area, Knight wasn't diligent. He left it up to his lieutenants and sergeants to check the bunker line." [...] In many cases they failed to do so, and the failure was compounded by Charlie Company being understrength and unable to man all the perimeter bunkers. Manning bunkers was not the only problem. Trip flares located in the concertina wire around the base were not always reset or replaced when they went off, a common occurrence caused in some cases by the rotor wash created by large CH-47 Chinook helicopters bringing in supplies or backhauling material as 1-46th Inf prepared to hand the base over to the ARVN. This lax attitude, combined with the skill of the attacking sappers, had fatal consequences for many in Charlie Company. Although not [...] "cringing in their bunkers", the defenders of Mary Ann were not prepared for a ground attack. This lack of readiness was not noted by the 196th LIB commander, Colonel William S. Hathaway during a visit to the base on 27 March, the day before the attack. He later stated that what he'd seen at Mary Ann that day [...] "was a big improvement over that I had seen before...the troops were alert." ...|$|E

50|$|The primary images {{available}} in FlyExpress are GEMs, or Genome-wide Expression Maps, that display the spatial patterns of genes during {{a state of}} fly development via heat maps. These not only give <b>a</b> visual <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to where these genes are expressed, but also {{how many of them}} are expressed in the same vicinity, as the darker regions of the heat map correlate to a higher expressed gene count.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{designed}} as an open campus, with very few walls to separate classes. This quickly gave way to temporary room dividers and eventually, more permanent walls. Major construction projects over the years added three classroom wings, a field house and an auditorium, leaving just <b>a</b> few <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> to the original design of the building. The school was considered futuristic with a swimming pool, greenhouse, and planetarium.|$|R
50|$|When formal methods prove too costly, {{a system}} can be checked solely on its syntax. This is not as thorough, as it only looks at a system on a surface level. However, it does give <b>a</b> {{developer}} many <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> to where <b>a</b> system's defects may lie.|$|R

60|$|Dave {{had hoped}} that {{the search for the}} missing cases would be an easy one, but in that he was disappointed. The three chums walked all around the knoll several times without getting {{anything}} in the way of <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to where Porton's cache was located.|$|E
30|$|Knowledge of the {{composition}} of the sands would provide <b>a</b> critical <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to how the individual sand particles get made. If the sand composition matches that of the haze, then it could be produced by sintering or by burial and erosion. If the sand composition matches that of the evaporite, however, then an evaporitic origin like White Sands, USA would be favored. Conversely, a sand particle composition made primarily from insoluble compounds would be consistent with flocculation.|$|R
50|$|A very alive Krona later finds John Stewart, Kilowog, Arisia, Two-Six and new Lantern Xrill-Vrek in a seeming hostile territory, {{long way}} from home. Given that this Krona is back to his Maltusan look and doesn't {{recognize}} any of the Green Lanterns and that the Green Lantern rings cannot locate anyone or the Central Power Battery, provides <b>a</b> little <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to what's happened. Either they have been displaced to another universe, another time, or both.|$|R
50|$|This {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the DIKAR model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result, it gives <b>a</b> strong <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management. The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision making for their success.|$|R
