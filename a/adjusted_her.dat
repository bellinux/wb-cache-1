25|$|At the time, {{accounts}} blamed strong currents. Later it {{was discovered}} that Apollo had taken on board an iron tank, but that no one had <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> compass for the influence of this large magnetic mass. Consequently, a small error in direction accumulated {{over the course of the}} five days; at the time Apollo struck Dixon thought she was forty or so miles out to sea. Because the convoy had endured bad weather since leaving Cork, no one had taken sightings that would have enabled them to correct their estimates of their position. Instead, they had relied on an approximately known speed and a biased heading for their estimate.|$|E
500|$|In later life, Wu {{became more}} outspoken. She protested the {{imprisonment}} in Taiwan of relatives of physicist Kerson Huang in 1959, {{and of the}} journalist Lei Chen in 1960. In 1964, she spoke out against gender discrimination at a symposium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [...] "I wonder", she asked her audience, [...] "whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment." [...] When men referred to her as Professor Yuan, she immediately corrected them {{and told them that}} she was Professor Wu. In 1975, Robert Serber, {{the new chairman of the}} Physics Department Columbia University, <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> pay to make it equal to that of her male counterparts. She protested the crackdown in China that followed the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.|$|E
2500|$|A decade later, the Goncourt brothers, diarists of the Second Empire, {{provided}} the fullest eyewitness portrait of La Païva, then close to 50 years of age. [...] "White skin, good arms, beautiful shoulders, bare behind {{down to the}} hips, the reddish hair under her arms showing each time that she <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> shoulder straps; a pear-shaped nose with heavy wings and the tip thick and flattened, like a Kalmuk's nose; the mouth a straight line cutting across a face all white with rice powder. Wrinkles which, under the light, look black in the white face; and down from {{each side of the}} mouth a crease {{in the shape of a}} horseshoe meeting beneath the chin and cutting across it in a great fold bespeaking age. On the surface, the face is that of a courtezan [...] who will not be too old for her profession when she is a hundred years old; but underneath, another face is visible from time to time, the terrible face of a painted corpse".|$|E
60|$|Old Betty {{was proof}} even against this temptation, {{and fell to}} <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> black bonnet and shawl.|$|R

60|$|Fast {{as she can}} she hurries--something ominous--her steps trembling; She {{does not}} tarry to smooth her white hair, nor <b>adjust</b> <b>her</b> cap.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rachel prided {{herself on}} always {{speaking}} her mind; she proceeded to speak it now, having <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> mental attitude to this amazing piece of news.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bundercombe <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> {{spectacles}} severely {{and transferred}} her regard to me. I felt somehow as though I were back {{at school and}} had been discovered in some ignominious escapade.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of it, Miss Marsh?" [...] said the {{president}} politely to that active young secretary, as he stood before it in the hall. The young woman <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> eye-glasses over her aquiline nose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Extremely exhilarating," [...] {{agreed the}} stenographer, <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> {{spectacles}} and smiling at Sam, for whom {{there was a}} soft spot in her heart.|$|R
6000|$|Fast {{as she can}} she hurries, {{something}} ominous, {{her steps}} trembling, [...] She does not tarry to smooth <b>her</b> hair nor <b>adjust</b> <b>her</b> cap.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's here?" [...] exclaimed Tabitha, <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> {{spectacles}} {{and holding}} the lamp over the open chest. [...] "Old Peter Goldthwaite's hoard of old rags!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{old lady}} <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> spectacles, lifted the {{dripping}} head into her lap, wiped {{the face of}} it with her apron, and gazed into its fishy eyes with tender curiosity. [...] "John," [...] said she, thoughtfully, [...] "is this yours?" ...|$|E
60|$|In blissful {{ignorance of}} his proceedings, Mrs. Chalk, having <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> cap {{in the glass}} and drawn on her gloves, sat patiently {{awaiting}} his return. She even drew a good-natured comparison between the time spent on choosing cigars and bonnets.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{looked in}} some {{surprise}} at the white garment spread over Miss Cornelia's ample lap. It was certainly a baby's dress, and it was most beautifully made, with tiny frills and tucks. Miss Cornelia <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> glasses and fell to embroidering with exquisite stitches.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{though we}} seldom imbibe it," [...] {{said the old}} Begum, ceremoniously <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> {{necklace}} of cowrie-shells, [...] "we occasionally employ it for medicinal purposes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{miscarriage}} {{is so much}} worse than a confinement," [...] Mrs. Thornbury murmured absentmindedly, <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> spectacles and picking up The Times. Mrs. Elliot rose and fluttered away.|$|R
60|$|As she ceased speaking, {{a double}} knock was heard against the inner door. The matron hastily <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> muffler, and {{resuming}} her {{chair by the}} hearth, demanded who was there.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Vervain <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> {{glasses with}} the thumb and finger {{of her right}} hand, and peered into Ferris's face with a gay smile. [...] "But the {{greatest}} part of the surprise is," [...] she resumed, lowering her voice a little, [...] "that Don Ippolito is going with us." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as she}} {{had entered}} the field Troy saw her, and {{sticking}} his pitchfork {{into the ground and}} picking up his crop or cane, he came forward. Bathsheba blushed with half-angry embarrassment, and <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> eyes as well as her feet to the direct line of her path.|$|E
60|$|Kate would willingly have excused {{herself from}} this {{flattering}} companionship; but Miss Knag having <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> bonnet to her entire satisfaction, took her arm {{with an air}} which plainly showed how much she felt the compliment she was conferring, {{and they were in}} the street before she could say another word.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] she exclaimed, at last, <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> {{stock and}} shaking her skirt, [...] "I'm ever so much obliged. It was very foolish in me to tumble off, wasn't it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Shirley Jones was {{pregnant}} while filming was under way; that baby, Patrick, kicked Robert Preston during the footbridge scene. The costume designers kept having to <b>adjust</b> <b>her</b> dresses to conceal her pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|Ballet is {{interested}} in the combination of abstraction and subject taken from reality. Based on her perception of space, she has defined a program which <b>adjusts</b> <b>her</b> desires and her way of working.|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Mary {{laid down}} her sewing, {{smoothed}} the ruffles of her sacque, <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> spectacles, opened the envelope, {{and began to}} read. Presently the letter fell to her lap, and she wiped her glasses and glanced at Honora, who was deep in her book once more. And in Honora's brain, as she read, was ringing the refrain of the prisoner: ...|$|E
60|$|There is no knowing in {{what this}} burst of feeling might have ended, if Miss Snevellicci had {{not at that}} moment proclaimed {{the arrival of the}} fly, which so astounded the bride that she shook off divers {{alarming}} symptoms which were coming on very strong, and running to the glass <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> dress, and calmly declared that she was ready for the sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|There is {{no sense}} in being too quiet with women folk, so I added a kiss with my crown piece; and I cannot help {{thinking}} that I have secured a partisan in Dorcas. At least, she blushed, and pocketed her little compliment with one hand, while, with the other, she <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> cherry-coloured ribbons, a little disordered by the struggle it cost me to attain the honour of a salute.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the same}} moment Mrs. Vervain came out {{through one of the}} long windows, and <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> glasses, said with a start, [...] "Why, my dear Don Ippolito, I shouldn't have known you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For shame!" [...] said Lucy, <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> little mouth gravely. [...] "It {{is rather}} dull of {{you not to}} guess my news, because it is about {{something}} I mentioned to you not very long ago." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{painting}} shows {{two women}} in an interior, with one {{seated at a table}} looking up from her book as <b>her</b> companion <b>adjusts</b> <b>her</b> dress before leaving. The muted tones are accentuated by a drawn curtain.|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} drew in {{her lips and}} fell silent. Then, as may happen at such moments, her ill-temper and chagrin, even the sense of her own dignity drooped away, {{and for a while}} in the {{quietness}} we were simply two ill-assorted human beings, helpless in the coils of circumstance. She composed her mouth, <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> bonnet strings, peered a moment from dim old eyes out of the window, then once more looked at me.|$|E
60|$|Luxuriously, she resented {{having to}} get up and tackle her heap of broken garments. But she did it. She took other clothes, <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> hair, tied on her apron, and went downstairs once more. She could not find Ciccio: he had gone out. A stray cat darted from the scullery, and broke a plate in her leap. Alvina found her washing-up water cold. She put on more, and began to dry her dishes.|$|E
60|$|Martha {{gave her}} a drink of the opiate in the glass, <b>adjusted</b> <b>her</b> on the pillow, and threw open the window, {{even to the point}} of {{removing}} the screen, and the gibbous moon flooded the room with light. She did not light a lamp, for its flame would heat the room. Besides, the moonlight was sufficient. It fell on the face of the sick woman till she looked like a thing of marble--all but her dark eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Jerome began hastily to <b>adjust</b> <b>her</b> damask {{napkin and}} the {{expression}} of her countenance for the reception of the clergyman, and Mr. Jerome went out to meet his guest, whom he greeted outside the door.|$|R
25|$|In Season 1, George {{has trouble}} <b>adjusting</b> to <b>her</b> circumstances—collecting souls while holding down a day job. By Season 2, she has mostly <b>adjusted</b> to <b>her</b> new role, with few {{unresolved}} issues {{with her life}} and her afterlife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Deil's in the fallow," [...] said Jenny, wiping <b>her</b> {{lips and}} <b>adjusting</b> <b>her</b> head-dress, [...] "he has twice the spunk o' Tam Halliday, after a'.--Coming, my leddy, coming--Lord have a care o' us, I trust the auld leddy didna see us!" ...|$|R
