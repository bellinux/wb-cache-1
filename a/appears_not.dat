5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that feature}} {{scandium}} in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E

5|$|Henry however <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to {{have dealt}} too savagely {{in dealing with}} heretics. On 1 May 1399, William Sawtrey, a Norfolk curate and a Lollard, was {{examined}} before him. Sawtrey recanted his heresies in public and apparently received no serious punishment, but after moving to London, Sawtrey's heretical preaching {{attracted the attention of}} Archbishop Thomas Arundel and he was summoned to appear before a convocation at St. Paul's. Despenser did not attend but sent a written memorandum on 23 February. Following his trial Sawtrey was condemned as a relapsed heretic and was burned in chains at Smithfield in 1401.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth was a {{significant}} settlement in Roman Britain, as the border fort of Blestium and as an important centre for ironworking. It is possible the Romans bridged the River Wye during their occupation, but the Monnow <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> {{to have had a}} crossing until after the Norman invasion. The Norman lord William FitzOsbern built a castle near the confluence of the two rivers in around 1070. The following two centuries saw the establishment of the Benedictine Priory and the development of the town as a defensive location on the Welsh Marches.|$|E

5|$|No {{compounds}} of oganesson {{have been}} synthesized yet, but calculations on theoretical compounds {{have been performed}} since 1964.

5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to have been aware that they were being carried out.|$|E

The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily fordable, <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a toll gate. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to move, but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{praised by}} the Emperor {{and the people}} of China, who all bow to her, an {{unprecedented}} honor. Mulan accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but politely declines his offer to be his advisor and instead asks to return to her family. She returns home and presents the imperial gifts to her father, but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely. Li Shang, who has become enamored with Mulan, soon arrives under the guise of returning her helmet but accepts the family's invitation for dinner. Earlier in the film, Mulan was declared unfit for marriage, but this now <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to be the case with her strong budding romance with Li Shang. Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration.|$|E

5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them croton finches because of their liking for the croton bush, but the pet trade <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to be a significant factor at present.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E

5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although the striped plumage of its two species suggests a distant relationship with streaked African Hirundo species. The other member of the genus is the Brazza's martin P.brazzae, although in the past it has sometimes been suggested that Brazza's martin should be moved to its own genus, Phedinopsis, due to the significant differences in vocalisations and nest type from its relative. The nearest relation of the two Phedina martins is the banded martin, Riparia cincta, which <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to be closely related to the other members of its current genus and resembles Brazza's martin in its nesting habits and calls. The current Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC)-recommended practice is to move the banded martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta, rather than to merge it into Phedina, since the banded martin's larger size, different bill and nostril shape and non-colonial nesting are differences from the current Phedina species.|$|E

5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk <b>appears</b> <b>not</b> to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept in touch with her exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E
