5|$|The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a {{considerably}} more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain. The Liberty Ridge Route runs up the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very <b>active</b> <b>Carbon</b> Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Active</b> <b>carbons</b> were {{produced}} from bagasse, millet and sorghum straws by chemical activation with H 3 PO 4. Carbon precursors with particle size of 1180 µm were used, {{in order to}} overcome difficulties caused by low density and high ash content. The influence of preparation conditions (temperature, residence time, and acid impregnation ratio) on the yield of the <b>active</b> <b>carbons</b> was examined. The impregnation ration which was controlled by varying the proportion of H 3 PO 4 used for the activation had a strong influence on the yields of the carbons. The pyrolysis temperature was varied in the range 100 - 450 °C, but equilibrium yields of the <b>active</b> <b>carbons</b> were highest at 450 C with optimum impregnation ratio of 13. 6. The potential of the <b>active</b> <b>carbons</b> as efficient and economical means of removing mixture of aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants from water was indicated by the complete removal of objectionable odor from contaminated water samples containing 35. 1348 mg/cm 3 benzene and 34. 8534 mg/cm 3 Toluene, which are known carcinogens. Spectrophotometric determinations of the two solutes in the remediate water samples indicated slow but steady adsorption of the benzene/toluene mixture on the <b>active</b> <b>carbons...</b>|$|R

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E

40|$|We use a fast density {{functional}} theory (a 'slab-DFT') and the polydisperse independent ideal slit-pore {{model to}} predict gas mixture adsorption in <b>active</b> <b>carbons.</b> The DFT is parametrized by fitting to pure gas isotherms generated by Monte Carlo simulation of adsorption in model graphitic slit-pores.

40|$|Pyrolysis of bagasse, sorghum and millet straws {{impregnated}} with ortho phosphoric acid, produced carbon with heterogeneous {{pore structure}} and high adsorption capacities. Carbon precursors with particle size of 1180 Î¼m were pyrolysed, to overcome difficulties caused by low density and high ash content. The <b>active</b> <b>carbons</b> obtained from low impregnation ratios (< 13. 6) were largely microporous.

25|$|Molasses Number is {{a measure}} of the degree of {{decolorization}} of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of <b>active</b> <b>carbons</b> for their rates of adsorption. Given two <b>active</b> <b>carbons</b> with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.|$|R
