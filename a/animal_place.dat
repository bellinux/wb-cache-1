40|$|This paper {{presents}} a submodule which computes {{the costs of}} controlling ammonia emissions in 27 European countries. The submodule will {{be incorporated into the}} RAINS (Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation) model. Abatement options included are low nitrogen feed, stable adaptations, covering manure storage, biofiltration and low nitrogen applications of manure. Cost estimates are based on country-, animal-, and technology specific data such as the stable size and fertilizer price, manure production per animal and the investments per <b>animal</b> <b>place.</b> Results are shown as costs functions for the year 2000 for Finland and the Netherlands. They suggest that ammonia emissions in Finland could be reduced by 30 % over the 1980 level at costs of 3 million DM per year only. Associated marginal costs would be 2300 DM/ton abated ammonia. A similar reduction in the Netherlands would cost 130 million DM per year. Marginal costs would be 4400 DM/ton ammonia abated. Using best available technologies, ammonia emissions in Finland could be reduced by nearly 55 %, and in the Netherlands by 65 % over the 1980 level. The cost functions show that up to a 50 % reduction over the 1980 level, marginal costs are relatively low. For further reductions, costs are expected to increase sharply since more expensive techniques have to be applied...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} the {{documentation of the}} first version of the Finnish Normative Manure System (FNMS). The system calculates Finnish manures as a mass balance starting from animal feeding and excretion (excretion ex animal) and considering national manure management in housing (manure ex housing) and manure storage (manure ex storage). The system calculates manures for 74 animal categories in four manure types (slurry, farmyard manure, deep litter and source-separated dung and urine). The total annual quantities of manure, dry matter, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) are reported per animal and per <b>animal</b> <b>place</b> (t/year). Also, the content of dry matter, organic matter and nutrients in manures are reported (kg/t). The system quantifies national manure amounts and their nutrient contents. It also enables calculation of regional manures. In addition, the calculation of biological methane production potential was included to enable estimation of biogas production potential from manure nationally and regionally. The calculation system works well and the results reported can be used for various purposes in policymaking, regulation, emission inventories, research and development all aiming at enhanced manure utilisation. The system can still benefit from developing especially the quality of the background data used. The system was created in co-operation with Luke and SYKE during 2014 - 2017. Financing for the system development was received from Finnish Ministry of the Environment (main project) and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (additional work e. g. related to excretion calculation and background data collection). A Finnish summary of this documentation report is also available (Luostarinen et al. 2017 a) ...|$|E
