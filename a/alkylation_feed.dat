40|$|The {{alkylation}} of isobutane and butene (C- 4 {{cut from}} industrial <b>alkylation</b> <b>feed)</b> catalyzed by triflic acid (TFSA) /trifluoroethanol (TFEA), has been systematically investigated in a batch autoclave. High selectivity of trimethylpentane (TMP, 80. 1 %) and high {{research octane number}} (RON, 97. 2) were achieved with 30 vol. % TFEA in TFSA/TFEA catalytic system at 8 C. Moreover, the TFSA/TFEA system can be recycled several times without significant loss of activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Alkylation of {{isobutane}} with butene (C- 4 {{cut from}} an industrial <b>alkylation</b> <b>feed)</b> was catalysed by {{a class of}} strongly acidic ionic liquids. A dramatic enhancement of the catalytic effect was observed for the ionic liquids containing the SbF 6 - anion. The optimal alkylate was obtained using the acidic ionic liquid [HMIm][SbF 6] (47. 9 wt. %) /CF 3 SO 3 H (52. 1 wt. %) as the catalyst. The C- 8 selectivity was as high as 80 % and the research octane number (RON) was 95. These results were better than those obtained by using either neat H 2 SO 4 or CF 3 SO 3 H as the catalyst.
