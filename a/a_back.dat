40|$|Measures of voltage {{and current}} were made {{at the same time}} using an electro-m agnetic oscillograph. Surface {{discharges}} with and without <b>a</b> <b>backing</b> electrode using the needle-to-blade of a razor gap were taken. The experiments were performed in dry air of close to O％ relative humidity at 101. 32 kPa pressure. Acryl resin was used in the sample plates as the electaical insulator. In the results, the current pulse of the discharge without <b>a</b> <b>backing</b> electrode was of a high frequency and the current pulse of the discharge with <b>a</b> <b>backing</b> electrode was of a scattered nature. It was confirmed by the appearance of the frequency of the current pulse that the life time of charges accumulated on the insulator in the discharge using <b>a</b> <b>backing</b> electrode was longer than when the discharge was produced without <b>a</b> <b>backing</b> electrode...|$|R
