25|$|In 1967, Scorsese {{made his}} first feature-length film, {{the black and white}} I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> with his fellow {{students}} actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, Mean Streets.|$|E
25|$|Thelma Colbert Schoonmaker (born January 3, 1940) is a French-born American {{film editor}} {{who has worked}} with {{director}} Martin Scorsese for over forty years. She started working with Scorsese on his debut feature film Who's That Knocking <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> (1967), and edited all of Scorsese's films since Raging Bull (1980). Schoonmaker has received seven Academy Award nominations for Best Film Editing, and has won three times—for Raging Bull (1980), The Aviator (2004), and The Departed (2006).|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{his films}} have {{featured}} corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Guilt is a prominent theme {{in many of}} his films, as {{is the role of}} Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Bringing Out the Dead, Mean Streets, Who's That Knocking <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Door,</b> The Departed, Shutter Island). He has been noted for his liberal usage of profanity and violence.|$|E

60|$|It {{all fell}} out quite {{miraculously}} {{as we had}} planned it. On the 24th of December we all met <b>at</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>door.</b>|$|R
25|$|She {{signed up}} for a brief six-week course in filmmaking at New York University (NYU), where she came into contact with budding young filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who was {{struggling}} to complete his film What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> (1967).|$|E
25|$|Usually has a quick cameo in {{his films}} (Who's That Knocking <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Door,</b> Boxcar Bertha, Mean Streets, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ (albeit hidden under a hood), The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Hugo). Also, often {{contributes}} {{his voice to}} a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street). He provides the opening voice-over narration in Mean Streets and The Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of Raging Bull; provides {{the voice of the}} unseen ambulance dispatcher in Bringing Out the Dead.|$|E

6000|$|... "Be <b>at</b> <b>my</b> back <b>door</b> in an hour's time. Say to {{the servant}} who opens it, 'I am the person expected.' He {{will lead you}} to me." ...|$|R

2500|$|Afterwards Spinks said: [...] "I came {{to fight}} like I said I would. I {{just tried to}} do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>door</b> big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
2500|$|Scorsese {{is known}} for his {{frequent}} use of slow motion, for example, in Who's That Knocking <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> (1967), Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). Also known for using freeze frame, such as the opening credits of The King of Comedy (1983), and throughout Goodfellas (1990). Such a shot is also used in Casino (1995) and The Departed (2006). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen {{through the eyes of the}} protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion (Cybill Shepherd in Taxi Driver; Cathy Moriarty's white bikini in Raging Bull; Sharon Stone's white minidress in Casino). This may possibly be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock. Scorsese often uses long tracking shots, as seen in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and Hugo. Use of MOS sequences set to popular music or voice-over, often involving aggressive camera movement and/or rapid editing. Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s silent film cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in Casino (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), Life Lessons, The Departed (on Matt Damon), and Hugo. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly Rio Bravo, The Great Train Robbery, Shane, The Searchers, and The Oklahoma Kid. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is song [...] "Gimme Shelter" [...] by The Rolling Stones; heard in several of Scorsese's films: Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed.|$|E

6000|$|... "We stopped {{two nights}} on the road, being lodged at solitary {{houses on the}} way. A guard was placed <b>at</b> <b>my</b> chamber <b>door,</b> and another <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window, and even had I not given my word I could not have escaped.|$|R
60|$|I had no time, however, {{to indulge}} the sorry mood that {{threatened}} to beset me, for the knocking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> chamber <b>door</b> continued, until at length I answered it with a command to enter.|$|R
60|$|How {{long the}} fit lasted, I don't know. I only {{remember}} that I was disturbed by a knock <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{this was}} not to be. Not long before my letter was {{received}} mother had died.

My father never answered my letter at all." ...|$|E

60|$|We kept up till late, {{and then}} I was left <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own <b>door</b> by <b>my</b> friend, who {{informed}} me that York was a very primitive, safe place, where people slept with unlocked doors, and nothing ever went amiss o'nights.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Oh, dear—dear!’ exclaimed {{the wretched}} {{partner of the}} depraved Tibbs. ‘She’s {{knocking}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>door.</b> We must be discovered! What will they think?’ ...|$|E
60|$|A discreetly gentle knock <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>door</b> was {{the first}} sound that aroused me. I heard the voice of my good old Benjamin {{speaking}} outside.|$|E

60|$|As {{we shook}} hands, Jeanne {{asked me if}} I knew where her uncle was. I could only tell {{her that he had}} left me <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own <b>door.</b> She made no remark; but she seemed to be uneasy on {{receiving}} that reply.|$|R
60|$|At last, however, I {{found myself}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own <b>door,</b> {{and in one}} moment {{satisfied}} myself that my brother was living, and better. My mother was in the salon, in conversation with M. de Poligny, who had the good judgment to withdraw.|$|R

60|$|They halted <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> {{and there}} was a firm, {{deliberate}} knock. Before I could reply, the handle was turned, and a figure stood upon the threshold.|$|E

6000|$|Once upon {{a midnight}} dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, [...] Over many a quaint and curious volume of {{forgotten}} lore-- [...] While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly {{there came a}} tapping, [...] As of some one gently rapping--rapping <b>at</b> <b>my</b> chamber <b>door.</b> [...] "'Tis some visitor," [...] I muttered, [...] "tapping <b>at</b> <b>my</b> chamber door-- [...] Only this and nothing more." ...|$|R
