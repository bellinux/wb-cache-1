500|$|For {{the first}} year of {{development}} the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team {{to come up with a}} narrative for Portal. The Portal team worked with Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw on fitting the game into the series' plot. This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for Portal, they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—Half-Life—to allow them to reuse the Half-Life 2 art assets. Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for Portal. The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process. They drafted early lines for the yet-named [...] "polite" [...] AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to [...] "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character. GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes [...] "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points." [...] Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as [...] "at the beginning of the Portal development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> cake." [...] The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by Kim Swift.|$|E
