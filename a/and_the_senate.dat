5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo. On 1 January 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic. Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he rarely did for presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

5|$|Kerr invited Whitlam and Minister for Labour Senator Jim McClelland {{to lunch}} on 30 October, {{immediately}} preceding an Executive Council meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating {{the threat of}} a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's right to block supply, refused any compromise.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{what was}} {{included}} in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately be incorporated into {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate. Examples of these details included the Speech and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, {{introduced}} a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention.

On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 in favor of a convention, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E
