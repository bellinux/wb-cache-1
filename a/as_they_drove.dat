5|$|The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced {{almost no}} {{resistance}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> east towards Belgrade, capturing Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar during the day. On {{the night of}} 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and secured a crossing over the Danube via an undamaged bridge near Bogojevo.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Soviet armaments {{production}} was fully operational and increasingly outproducing the German war economy. The final major German offensive in the Eastern {{theater of the}} Second World War took place during July—August 1943 with the launch of Operation Zitadelle, {{an assault on the}} Kursk salient. Approximately one million German troops confronted a Soviet force over 2.5 million strong. Following the defeat of Operation Zitadelle, the Soviets then launched counter-offensives employing six million men along a 1500 mile front towards the Dnepr River <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> the Germans westwards. Employing increasingly ambitious and tactically sophisticated offensives, along with making operational improvements in secrecy and deception, the Red Army was eventually able to liberate much of the area which the Germans had previously occupied by the summer of 1944. The destruction of Army Group Centre, the outcome of Operation Bagration, proved to be a decisive success; additional Soviet offensives against the German Army Groups North and South in the fall of 1944 put the German war machine into retreat. By January 1945, Soviet military might was aimed at the German capital of Berlin. The war ended with the total defeat and capitulation of Nazi Germany in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{team was}} able to score in the first quarter. Michigan had the best scoring opportunity, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> down into the Ohio State red zone before Denard Robinson fumbled the ball during a run. Ohio State opened the scoring {{early in the second}} quarter with a 33-yard field goal by Devin Barclay, and then added to their lead with a 7-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Dane Sanzenbacher. Michigan got their only points of the game a few minutes later with a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. Ohio State then proceeded to score 27 unanswered points and put the game out of reach. Immediately following the Michigan touchdown, Jordan Hall returned the kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Ohio State then added to their lead with a 33-yard reception by DeVier Posey. The Buckeyes had a chance to extend their lead {{at the end of the}} first half, but a Terrelle Pryor pass was intercepted by Jordan Kovacs in the Michigan endzone. In the third quarter, Dan Herron added a 32-yard run, and Barclay added two more field goals from 36 and 23 yards. These were the final points of the game, as neither team {{was able to}} score in the final quarter.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, {{the rear}} area staff of 4th Army {{headquarters}} were captured by Ustaše at Topusko, and were soon {{handed over to}} the Germans by their captors. Nedeljković and his operations staff escaped, and made their way to Prijedor. Other units were retreating into Bosnia, including two battalions and 2–3 artillery batteries from the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. Nedeljković attempted to deploy rear area units of the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska into a defensive line along the Una at Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi, Bosanska Krupa and Bihać, and called Yugoslav Supreme Command in Sarajevo to request reinforcements. With his remaining troops, Raketić attempted to establish a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and the mouth of the Vrbas. These efforts were significantly hampered by Ustaše propaganda. The German orders for the following day were to pursue the remnants of the Yugoslav Army through Bosnia towards Sarajevo, where they would be met by the First Panzer Group attacking from the south and east. The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced almost no resistance <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> east towards Belgrade, capturing Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar during the day. On the night of 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and secured a crossing over the Danube via an undamaged bridge near Bogojevo.|$|E
25|$|A racing circuit, the Charade Circuit, {{close to}} the city, using {{closed-off}} public roads held the French Grand Prix in 1965, 1969, 1970 and 1972.

Early December they aided in the evacuation of the Ypres Benedictine Convent, whose occupants subsequently established Kylemore Abbey in Connemara, Ireland.|$|R
25|$|Washington took {{advantage}} of two key penalties against the Lions on their first drive <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> 79 yards to score on Davis' 1-yard touchdown run. The first was a running into the punter penalty against linebacker Clint Kriewaldt that enabled them to keep the ball, and the second was a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Lions defensive back Bryant Westbrook. The next time Washington got the ball, they drove 87 yards, featuring a 58-yard run by Davis, and scored with another Davis touchdown run to take a 14–0 lead.|$|E
25|$|Super Go Karts: The karts {{were meant}} to be driven around a small loop track at a speed of about 20mph (32km/h) set by the {{governor}} devices on them. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging tennis balls into them, and they were known to do so for parkgoers. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine car ride became a chance to play bumper cars at 50mph (80km/h), and many injuries resulted from head-on collisions. Also, the engines were poorly maintained, and some riders were overcome by gasoline fumes <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove.</b>|$|E
25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E

Rabbi Edgar F. Magnin officiated the private ceremony, with Shearer's brother, Douglas Shearer, giving the bride away, and Louis B. Mayer acting <b>as</b> best man. <b>They</b> <b>drove</b> to Monterey for their honeymoon.|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{episode was}} a made-for-television movie {{originally}} titled In Tandem - {{a reference to}} the tandem axles on the tractor and trailer, as well <b>as</b> that <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> <b>as</b> a team, or [...] "in tandem". The movie begins with Will sliding out of control in a truck he was driving, due to poor maintenance of the brakes. After he manages to get the truck stopped, he drives to a truck stop and calls the company to quit his job. He then meets Sonny, a [...] "gypsy" [...] trucker, and they decide to try driving as a team, which works out well.|$|R
60|$|Riding {{in these}} chariots {{was not a}} very great luxury, {{especially}} to those who were not accustomed to that kind of carriage exercise. There were no seats, nor any springs. The riders were obliged to stand up, and take all the bumps that stones and roots chose to give them, and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> generally <b>drove</b> at full speed, these were doubtless many and hard. There was in general no back to these Chariots, and a sudden jerk of the horses would shoot the rider out behind, unless he knew how to avoid such accidents.|$|R
25|$|The Parliamentarians {{put up a}} {{surprisingly}} stout resistance, {{and according to the}} Royalists shot at them from houses <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> the small Parliamentary force from the town and back towards Lichfield from whence they came. To suppress the musket fire, the Royalists torched the houses from which the shooting was thought to come. After the battle the Royalists {{spent the rest of the}} day in the town during which time they pillaged it. The next morning after the main body of the Royalist force had left town, many more houses were put to the torch. While pillaging and firing an unfortified town in retaliation for resistance was common at that time on Continental Europe it was not usual in England and this handed the Parliamentary side a propaganda weapon which they used to disparage the Royalists.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon was not {{completely}} defeated by the disaster in Russia. The following year he raised an army of around 400,000 French troops supported by {{a quarter of a}} million allied troops to contest control of Germany in the larger campaign of the Sixth Coalition. Despite being outnumbered, he won a large victory at the Battle of Dresden. Napoleon could replace the men he lost in 1812, but the huge numbers of horses he lost in Russia proved more difficult to replace, and this proved a major problem in his campaigns in Germany in 1813. It was not until the decisive Battle of Nations (October 16–19, 1813) that he was finally defeated and afterwards no longer had the troops to stop the Coalition's invasion of France. Napoleon did still manage to inflict many losses in the Six Days Campaign and a series of minor military victories on the far larger Allied armies <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> towards Paris, though they captured the city and forced him to abdicate in 1814.|$|E
25|$|Denver {{compiled}} 310 {{rushing yards}} and 511 total yards of offense, {{and held the}} ball for 40:59 in a 42–17 win, avenging their playoff loss to the Jaguars the year before. The Broncos dominated early, converting their first nine third downs and scoring touchdowns on their first three drives. First, they converted four third downs <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> 72 yards in 7:21, featuring a 25-yard reception by Ed McCaffrey on third and 15, and scored on a 2-yard touchdown run by Terrell Davis. Jacksonville was forced to a three-and-out on their next drive, and Bryan Barker's punt went just 24 yards to the Denver 40-yard line. The Broncos then drove 60 yards and increased their lead to 14-0 with a 43-yard touchdown pass from John Elway to Rod Smith on third down and 4 with 2:37 {{left in the first}} quarter. Reggie Barlow returned the ensuing kickoff 37 yards to midfield, and Jacksonville subsequently drove to the Denver 40, but were stopped there and had to punt. Barker's kick pinned the Broncos back at their own 8, but they still drove 92 yards to make the score 21-0 on Davis' 5-yard touchdown run. The key play of the drive was a 40-yard completion from Elway to Smith on third down and 6 from their own 12-yard line. Later in the drive, Elway completed a 16-yard pass to Smith on third down and 13 from the Jags 26. By this point, Elway had completed all six of his passes for 156 yards on third down plays.|$|E
25|$|Green Bay {{responded to}} the field goal with Favre's 12-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Sharpe. Then Green Bay caught a break when their kickoff hit the ground near the sideline, bounced into returner Mel Gray and then bounced out of bounds at the Lions 5-yard line. But it didn't stop Detroit <b>as</b> <b>they</b> still <b>drove</b> 95 yards, featuring a 44-yard run by Sanders and a 13-yard third down conversion reception by Perriman after the ball bounced off Sanders' hands, and scored on Perriman's one handed 1-yard touchdown reception to take a 10–7 lead {{at the end of}} the half.|$|R
50|$|The park {{featured}} a drive-through safari section, which allowed for wild animals to roam free and approach vehicles <b>as</b> <b>they</b> slowly <b>drove</b> through. Drivers and their passenger(s) could observe peacocks, baboons, camels, elephants, llamas, giraffes, and Siberian tigers in this section, either {{in their cars}} or on a Jungle Habitat bus. Many of the animals would climb atop the cars, and/or walk in front of vehicles, bringing them to a halt. Signs were posted along the route to warn visitors to keep their windows closed. Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey, approximately 100 mi to the south, also had (until recently) a similar type of drive-through safari attraction (theirs has now been converted to a ride-through attraction {{as part of the}} amusement park, so it is still viewed by vehicle but not by car).|$|R
60|$|The {{splashing}} {{top of a}} sea slopped {{into the}} canoe <b>as</b> <b>they</b> got way on her, and they taxed their strength to the utmost during the next hour. The craft bucked and jumped <b>as</b> <b>they</b> laboriously <b>drove</b> her over the confused swell, which was rapidly getting higher, and there was already {{a good deal of}} water washing about inside her. Once or twice Frank held his breath as a threatening mass of water heaved up ahead, but in each case she lurched across it safely, and presently they found smoother water under another crag. He gave a sigh of relief when at length they reached the cove and beached her upon the shingle. They turned her over to empty before they ran her up, and then Harry sat down upon a boulder. Frank already had discovered that he seldom talked of anything <b>they</b> had done <b>as</b> though it were an exploit.|$|R

Long Jack and Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began to heave up the anchor, the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last. The anchor {{came up with a}} sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop steadied her at the wheel. [...] "Up jib and foresail," [...] said he.|$|R
500|$|In {{heavy rain}} that {{announcer}} Kevin Kugler {{described as a}} [...] "deluge", Penn State's Blue Band wore ponchos in the stands during a [...] "blue out", to support the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape. After Penn State went three-and-out to start the game, Kent State got excellent field position at the opposition's 36-yard line after Penn State committed kick catching interference on the punt, but failed to capitalize as their kicker, Anthony Melchiori, missed a 31-yard field goal. Penn State's next drive stalled, and on fourth down, quarterback Christian Hackenberg executed a [...] "pooch punt", in which the quarterback lines up in the shotgun formation, and punts the ball, for 44-yards pinning Kent State inside their 10-yard line. Penn State drove down the field {{late in the first}} quarter getting it to the five-yard line, when Hackenberg had the ball slip from his hand backing Penn State up to the 15-yard line, but on the subsequent play, Hackenberg completed a 15-yard pass to Bill Belton for a touchdown to culminate a 9-play, 87-yard drive encapsulating 3:39. Kent State's offense again proved ineffective, and Penn State's proved strong, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>drove</b> down the field on a 10-play, 82-yard drive ending with Zach Zwinak running for a 2-yard touchdown. Towards {{the end of the first}} half, the teams began to exchange punts, and the half ended with Penn State ahead 14–0. In the third quarter, Hackenberg threw an interception, but on the next drive, Kent State threw an interception and Penn State got the ball back. Later in the quarter, Penn State ran a 51-yard drive that got them inside the ten-yard line down to the one, at which point Zwinak ran for a touchdown, his second of the game. Later in the quarter, Penn State began another drive that spilled into the fourth quarter on which Akeel Lynch was the primary running back for the Lions, running for a total of 78 yards en route to Sam Ficken booting his first field goal of the game, a 25-yarder. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Penn State embarked on a drive that milked over five-and-a-half minutes off the clock and culminated with Zwinak rushing for his third touchdown of the game, a one-yard score with 6:42 to play. After another lackluster drive by Kent State, they punted for the ninth time, and on Penn State's ensuing drive, Tyler Ferguson entered at quarterback, and Von Walker, a member of Penn State's [...] "run-on" [...] program, entered at running back, and on the drive, Ficken kicked a personal record 54-yard field goal, the longest by a Penn State player since 1979, [...] which was the final scoring play of the game, whose final score was 34–0.|$|E
