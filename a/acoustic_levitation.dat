40|$|Directing {{acoustic}} waves along {{curved paths}} {{is critical for}} applications such as ultrasound imaging, surgery and acoustic cloaking. Metamaterials can direct waves by spatially varying the material properties through which the wave propagates. However, this approach is not always feasible, particularly for acoustic applications. Here we demonstrate the generation of acoustic bottle beams in homogeneous space without using metamaterials. Instead, the sound energy flows through a three-dimensional curved shell in air leaving a close-to-zero pressure region in the middle, exhibiting the capability of circumventing obstacles. By designing the initial phase, we develop a general recipe for creating self-bending wave packets, which can set acoustic beams propagating along arbitrary prescribed convex trajectories. The measured acoustic pulling force experienced by a rigid ball placed inside such a beam confirms the pressure field of the bottle. The demonstrated acoustic bottle and self-bending beams have potential applications in medical ultrasound imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, as well as <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitations</b> and isolations...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of current {{interest}} in understanding the thermodynamic behaviour of liquids in the undercooled state. In industrial systems as well as in nature, liquid states are found to exist below the freezing point, especially if a pure liquid remains in a relatively undisturbed state. For undercooled liquids, the measurement of thermophysical properties such as viscosity, surface tension and thermal diffusivity present challenges because any physical interference with a probe could lead to solidification. The undercooled state is sustainable in a containerless environment that may be provided for by <b>acoustic</b> or electrostatic <b>levitation.</b> Among the methods used, the relaxation history of deformed drops as they revert back towards spherical shape is recorded and used to obtain viscosity. Similarly, the thermal relaxation of an initially heated drop is thermographically recorded and the history is used to evaluate the thermal diffusivity. Another technique involving the stimulation of thermocapillary flow on a levitated liquid sample with a laser has also been developed. Thermal measurements include additional challenges because of buoyant convection which dominates over thermocapillary flow masks the desired measurements. Therefore, drops horizontally flattened by the acoustic field are used. This procedure reduces the hydrostatic head to 0. 5 mm and significantly reduces the presence of buoyant convection. In this review, some techniques involving physical and thermal manipulation of highly viscous liquids in the levitated state are discussed and the feasibility of some new methods is discussed and evaluated. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Containerless {{processing}} is {{an important}} tool for thermophysical property measurements and materials research. The freedom from a crucible allows processing of liquid materials in a metastable undercooled state, as well as allowing processing of high temperature and highly reactive melts. Electrostatic levitation (ESL) is a containerless method which provides a number of unique advantages, including the decoupling of positioning force from sample heating, the ability to operate in ultra-high vacuum or at moderate gas pressure (approximately 3 atm), {{and the ability to}} process non-conducting materials. ESL also has the potential to reduce internal flow velocities below those possible with electromagnetic, acoustic, or aero-acoustic techniques. The ESL facility at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is in use for thermophysical property measurements and materials research by a number of different internal and external investigators. The methods for obtaining access to the facility, as well as a summary of current capabilities and some future directions will be discussed. In electrostatic levitation, the acceleration of gravity (or residual acceleration in reduced gravity) is opposed by the action of an applied electric field on a charged sample. This positioning method is applicable to any material which can be electrically charged, whether solid or liquid, conducting, or insulating. Because the position of the sample is unstable, a 3 -dimensional active control loop rapidly adjusts the applied field to maintain levitation and minimize motion of the sample. Heating lasers melt the sample, and may be adjusted to maintain specified thermal profiles. Microgravity allows electrostatic levitation to work even more effectively. With the need to cancel less than 1 milli-g, the applied field required is reduced from approximately 10 MV/m to approximately 10 kV/m. Alternatively, a microgravity ESL can position larger samples than is possible on the ground, or it can position samples which maintain their charge poorly. Microgravity also reduces the effects of buoyant convection and sedimentation. In the MSFC ESL, many different classes of experiments and measurements have been demonstrated in collaboration with many investigators. These capabilities include heat capacity measurement, phase diagram determination, and nucleation and growth experiments including nucleation rate, TTT curves, and phase selection. We have demonstrated the capability of triggering recalescence of an undercooled liquid sample without loss of levitation. Currently under development are techniques for measuring the surface tension, viscosity, and density of levitated samples, as well as other thermophysical properties. Expanded levitation capabilities including various gas environments for sample processing, sample rotation control and management of thermal gradients are under development for the MSFC ESL. Containerless processing allows research on materials which may not be processed any other way. Electrostatic levitation extends the range of containerless processing to include many materials and classes of materials which cannot be processed by conventional electromagnetic, <b>acoustic,</b> or aerodynamic <b>levitation</b> techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of a resonant tube {{on the performance of}} acoustic standing wave-based levitation device (<b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> device hereinafter) is studied by analyzing the acoustic pressure and levitation force of four types of <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> devices without a resonance tube and with resonance tubes of different radii R using ANSYS and MATLAB. Introducing a resonance tube either enhances or weakens the levitation strength of <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> device, depending on the resonance tube radii. Specifically, the levitation force is improved to a maximum degree when the resonance tube radius is slightly larger than the size of the reflector end face. Furthermore, the stability of <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> device is improved to a maximum degree by introducing a resonance tube of R= 1. 023 λ. The experimental platform and levitation force measurement system of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> device with concave-end-face-type emitter and reflector are developed, and the test of suspended matters and liquid drops is conducted. Results show that the Φ 6. 5 -mm steel ball is suspended easily when the resonance tube radius is 1. 023 λ, and the Φ 5. 5 -mm steel ball cannot be suspended when the resonance tube radius is 1. 251 λ. The levitation capability of the original <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> device without a resonance tube is weakened when a resonance tube of R= 1. 251 λ is applied. These results are consistent with the ANSYS simulation results. The levitation time of the liquid droplet with a resonance tube of R= 1. 023 λ is longer than without a resonance tube. This result is also supported by the MATLAB simulation results. Therefore, the performance of <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> device can be improved by introducing a resonant tube with an appropriate radius...|$|E

Furthermore, Pt/microporous La 2 O 3 could be one-step prepared by the <b>acoustic</b> <b>levitation</b> method without any pretreatment/modification of raw oxide. Based on the XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis, we can infer that the La 2 O 3 oxide layer indeed covers and contacts with the Pt metal, leading to the formation of surface La–O–Pt species, on which abundant oxygen defects can be created to facilitate the electrophilic oxidation reaction.|$|E
