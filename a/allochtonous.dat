Molecular quantification by competitive PCR has shown that the highest quantities of Gram-negative merA genes in intertidal freshwater mudflat sediments are located in recent sediment deposits independently of mercury concentrations, suggesting that particle-attached <b>allochtonous</b> mercury-resistant merA bacteria are deposited on mudflat surfaces. To investigate this hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was carried out to evaluate the respective contributions of (i) the input of <b>allochtonous</b> merA bacteria supplied by WWTP-treated effluents and (ii) merA gene abundance corresponding to a response of the sediment's autochthonous bacterial community to mercury contamination. Gram-negative merA gene quantification and T-RFLP analysis of both 16 S rDNA and merA genes demonstrated that deposited <b>allochtonous</b> bacteria did not develop in estuarine sediments, whereas mercury contamination (10 μg g− 1 wet sediment) selected an autochthonous mercury-resistant merA bacterial community. Thus, in mudflats of highly anthropized macrotidal estuaries, i. e. those subjected to intense hydrosedimentary processes and continuously contaminated by mercury and fecal bacteria, inputs of <b>allochtonous</b> merA bacteria are largely responsible for the high quantities of merA genes on the surface of mudflat sediments...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ways {{social workers in}} the Netherlands deal with a {{diversity}} of clients, particularly focussing on <b>allochtonous</b> clients. The study is motivated by the current hegemonic tendency to problematise <b>allochtonous</b> Dutch, often explained {{along the lines of}} culture. It was assumed that within such a social atmosphere concerning the multicultural society cultural diversity could be expected {{to have an impact on}} both the professional discourse of social workers and their everyday practices with clients. Making use of an ethnographic-oriented and a discourse-analytical approach, the empirical data in this study derive from a fieldwork study in a Dutch social work department and a literature study on the historical context in which social work developed as a discipline. The fieldwork study, including among others 15 interviews with social workers and 26 observations of meetings with (<b>allochtonous</b> and autochthonous) clients, demonstrates that in spite of the professional repertoire of client-centredness, which indicates the importance of linking up with where the client stands, and despite the fact that the policy of the studied social work organisation towards clients is based on an integral approach that does not differentiate between clients and takes each client as an individual, social workers often make use of categories to make sense of their clients. This is true even while the two conditions mentioned above would be assumed to allow room for an individualised approach. In the case of dealing with <b>allochtonous</b> clients, this use of categories appears to be even more explicit. The study found that social workers often are inclined to: first, categorise these clients as being different from autochtonous clients; and second as being difficult, because they are perceived to deviate from the desirable client identity; and third, to explain the deviance in terms of culture. That is, <b>allochtonous</b> clients in this study are often homogeneously characterised as 'others' that appear to deviate from social worker's expectations about clients. The literature study shows the impact of the development of social work as a result of being closely related to the Dutch welfare state. The shifting aim of social work, from moral uplift or 'the fight against the unsocialness' to emancipation nowadays, could indicate that social workers have left behind their explicit way of disciplining those defined as deviating from hegemonic standards. Nevertheless, this study argues that an emphasis on empowerment and the socio-political demands of being fully-fledged members of society may also relate to an ideology of adjustment and that the <b>allochtonous</b> clients are targeted as well. The social workers from the fieldwork study frame their clients very much via the script of a modern, responsible and autonomous individual - which is a current cultural framework in the Netherlands itself. As a social work practice, however, this emphasis on empowerment as the preferred route of change can be interpreted as constraining the space for diversity. Moreover, social workers here do not very often appear to recognise that empowerment is also a hegemonic cultural framework that can be as deterministic as the 'culture' they perceive to be an obstacle in the counselling...|$|E

However, {{there is concern}} about its conservation {{because the number of}} European hares has drastically declined in Europe since the 1960 s and the species is now considered at low risk of extinction. During the last decades, several countries have carried out restocking programs with the introduction of <b>allochtonous</b> individuals. We analyzed 109 blood samples from two brown hare popula-tions captured in two protected areas in northern Italy, where no animals have been released in the last 20 years, to assess genetic variability and inbreeding status for management and conservation purposes. For this study, eight microsatellite markers were selected from those described in the literature and two multiplex PCR reactions were optimised. The number of alleles per locus, allelic frequencies, observed and expected heterozygosity, and inbreeding coefficient were then calculated. Our results revealed good genetic variability in both populations. Analysis of brown hare populations in a larger number of protected areas would be useful for improving their man-agement through wider genetic characterization of populations for restocking programs, more accurate measurement of their genetic distances, evaluation of the reduction in their genetic variability and gene flows among adjacent areas, and perhaps detection of the intro-duction of <b>allochtonous</b> animals...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn northeastern Vietnam, {{the major}} tectonic episode {{responsible}} for nappes emplacement is Triassic. These <b>allochtonous</b> structures are intruded by granitic melts. Two post-tectonic massifs showing {{no sign of}} deformation have been dated by the LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb techniques. Dating reveals a multiphase history with zircon cores showing evidence of Proterozoic magmatism. The emplacement of the Phia Bioc granite intrusive in <b>allochtonous</b> units is 248 - 245 Ma, an age which assesses a younger limit for the major nappes tectonic. This tectonic could be synchronous of the tectonometamorphic strike-slip faulting events (250 - 245 Ma) defined in the Truong Son Belt as the Indosinian orogen. The Phia Bioc intrusion is probably linked with the intra-plate magmatism of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province or with magma- tism associated with the Paleotethys closure. The age of the Phia Oac granite intrusion in displaced units is much younger, at 87. 3 ± 1. 2 Ma. This granite is probably linked to the magmatic activity produced dur- ing the Paleo-Pacific plate subduction under the SE Asia continental plate during the Mesozoic.

We performed joint studies on the metamorphic basement and the Mesozoic sedimentary cover, in the aim to understand {{the influence of the}} structural inheritance of the Variscan orogene on the onset of the Mesozoic basin subsidence. The basement's structure below relatively thin sedimentary cover was reconstructed from geological knowledge and geophysical methods (ground gravimetry and airborne magnetism, BRGM dataset). Palaeogeography and sedimentary geometries were recomposed from field studies and well logs issued from water wells. Mesozoic sedimentation on the Poitou high started during Lower Jurassic (Lias). Our data demonstrate that Liassic subsidence pattern is closely linked to the Variscan orogenic heritage. The autochtonous, poorly deformed thick crust on the northern Poitou high did not subside during most of Lias. On the opposite, in the <b>allochtonous</b> southern part, onset of subsidence took place since the early Liassic times. The first deposits are observed along narrow areas, elongated along N 160 oriented geophysical anomalies. This structural direction corresponds to Late Carboniferous to Permian tardi-orogenic extension. On the opposite, N 110 syn-orogenic structures do not influence the distribution of Lias sediments. Onset of sedimentation, fault plays and subsidence patterns during Lias extension, are thus closely related to the variscan heritage, and particularly with the extensive tardi-orogenic history...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{determined}} Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions and major- and trace-element compositions of {{soil samples}} recovered from three soil profiles developed on relatively young pyroclastic deposits, less than 10, 000 years old, of the Mount Cameroon volcano. The time elapsed since then is short {{compared with the}} half-lives of Rb, Sm, U and Th, suggesting that radioactive decay can be neglected. We therefore assumed that (i) these polyphase soils developed on isotopically homogenous substrates and (ii) any isotopic variation within such profiles cannot be due to selective dissolution of primary minerals with isotopic compositions {{different from that of}} bulk bedrock. Any Sr, Nd or Pb isotopic variation would therefore record an <b>allochtonous</b> input occurring either in a solid or dissolved state. Sr and Nd isotope compositions change systematically with depth in the soil profile; in particular, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are far greater in the humic horizons than in the underlying horizons, except in the CA 9 H soil profile. Although smaller than for Sr isotope compositions, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios displayed an inverse relationship with a decrease towards the uppermost organic-rich horizons. These isotope shifts correlate with changes in Sr and Nd contents, suggesting an <b>allochtonous</b> input characterized by significantly different isotope compositions and slightly lower Sr contents but higher Nd contents. Pb isotopic compositions and Pb concentrations in the uppermost horizons were distinct from those of underlying horizons in the soil sequences. Since an anthropogenic contamination such as from leaded petrol cannot explain the Pb shifts, a natural source has to be invoked for Pb, as well as for Sr and Nd. Considering both the wind paths in West Africa and the isotopic shifts registered in the uppermost horizons, Saharan dust appears to be the best candidate to explain such variations. These inputs probably happened in winter when dry warm Harmattan wind blows from the northeast. A maximum of 8 % of Saharan dust accretion was calculated for the Mount Cameroon soils. This corresponds to average dust deposition rates between 1. 3 and 0. 8 g cm 2 ka 1, values that are much higher than those found in Hawaiian soils by Kurtz et al. [Kurtz, A. C., Derry, L. A., Chadwick, O. A., 2001. Accretion of Asian dust to Hawaiian soils: Isotopic, elemental and mineral mass balances. Geochim. Cosmochim.

Our data suggest that the phytoplankton component has a seasonally and spatially variable delta 13 C signature, which is surpressed by the terrestrial signal but may at times fall in the same range as the delta 13 C of the <b>allochtonous</b> matter. It is argued that the phytoplankton delta 13 C decreases after the onset of the monsoon rains, most likely due to the 13 C-depletion of the DIC pool caused by the microbial respiration of the <b>allochtonous</b> organic matter. At each of the 4 sites selected for concurrent zooplankton sampling, the zooplankton showed a much wider range of delta 13 C than did the {{suspended matter}}, with overall delta 13 C values between - 30. 14 and - 16. 45 ppt. In addition, spatial differences in average delta 13 C were much more pronounced for zooplankton than for total suspended matter. These data indicate that zooplankton feed on a component of the suspended matter pool, which has more pronounced seasonal and spatial delta 13 C variations than the total suspended matter. Thus, despite the large amounts of terrestrial and mangrove detritus present in the water column, the locally produced phytoplankton appears to be a more important carbon source for the zooplankton...|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{research}} on ethnic minorities and {{the digital divide}} has shown that ethnic minorities are often among the high-risk groups for being excluded in the information society. In this paper research results are discussed from a survey research project in which the digital media possession, digital media use and the attitudes towards digital media among both autochtonous youngsters and youngsters from ethnic minorities were studied in Brussels. In this way, it is tested if a digital divide between the mayority and minorities still shows up among youngsters in Brussels. If possession is {{used to measure the}} digital divide, there is a digital divide if Internet possession is taken into account: autochtonous youngsters have more often an Internet connection, but almost everyone seems to own a computer. Game computers such as Playstation, Xbox and Nintendo consoles are owned even more by youngsters from ethnic minorities. This proves that apart from the digital divide there also exists a literacy divide : a difference between an information or entertainment oriented media culture. This literacy divide is however mitigated if other criteria, next to possession, are used as measurement techniques. There still is a difference in Internet use (not in computer use) between autochtonous and <b>allochtonous</b> youngsters, but the possession and use difference do not correlate with an attitude difference, measured with a computer attitude scale. When <b>allochtonous</b> youngsters do use computers and the Internet they even use it more often for information related activities, such as participating in news groups or searching information about employment, religion or politics. This means that digital media use can have a compensatory literacy and citizenship function for youngsters from ethnic minorities. The differences in digital media possession and use can be explained as a consequence of structural, social and economic differences or as a consequence of cultural differences. Using statistical analysis, a comparison is made between the influence of structural and cultural differences, which demonstrates that structural variables explain more powerfully the difference between the mayority and the ethnic minorities. A big difference between the autochtonous and the <b>allochtonous</b> youngsters is that among the allochtons social class does matter, whereas the autochtons are a more homogeneous middle class, at least when digital media possession and usage are used to measure these differences. Comparable results are found when social class is measured using a scale for measuring the occupational status of the parents, or when social class is measured using the level of education from the father or from the mother. The results of this survey research are used to find research questions for qualitative research.

40|$|If {{we assume}} that culture is not a static phenomenon, but one which {{develops}} in line with concrete political, social, economic and cultural circumstances, then we must assume that that the Greeks in the Netherlands, {{who live and work}} in circumstances which are different to those of the Greek inhabitants of Greece, also develop different cultural models. Furthermore, if {{we assume that}} someone’s identity is not fixed and is not inherited, but is formed and developed in successive concrete circumstances, then one can expect that the individual develops an identity (or in general a personality) which suits their social environment. In the case of <b>allochtonous</b> children, their environment for socialisation is generally biculturalbilingual. Greek children in The Netherlands come into contact with different worlds: one - on the streets or at school for example - where the Dutch element is dominant, another – family life - where another sort of culture has developed, and life in Greece during the summer. What parents and teachers of the mother tongue call “ours” cannot be the same for children born in a foreign country. The question then naturally arises: “Who am I? What is my relation to this here and that there? Since the environment of these Greek children is bicultural and bilingual (or even multicultural and multilingual), then their ego synthesis will also have a certain bicultural character. In theory a synthesis of the two cultures will take place in the mental world of the children. This thesis reports on an investigation into the bicultural-bilingual socialisation of Greek pupils in the Netherlands against the background of the migration of families and their social-cultural and economic position in the Netherlands. The research carried out is sociological in nature, with a strong educational bent. This means that the relation which the Greek pupils have with Greek language teaching is examined at the same time. Which problems have an influence on Greek language teaching, and how can these be dealt with? The reason for conducting this research lies in the issues raised by the position of Greek migrants in the neo-European structure and in the role which education can play in forming the ethnic-cultural identity of Greek children in the Netherlands. The changing perception of the Greek government with regard to education policy for Greek pupils in the diaspora, and the resulting changes in objectives, are an important reason for making these pupils the target of the research. The social goal of the research is to survey the socialisation of Greek pupils in multicultural Dutch society. The aim is to gain insight into the set of factors involved in socialisation. The scientific goal is to contribute to the theory development {{in the area of the}} socialisation of allochtonous(Greek) children. Acquiring a bicultural identity is of great importance to <b>allochtonous</b> children when it comes to social success. The encouragement of a joint radical (education) policy by both countries (country of origin and country of residence) will be advantageous to both sides, not only for the individual but also for the society as a whole. The results presented in this research report could form a frame of reference for delineating a policy in this area – by means of bilateral agreements – between Greece and the Netherlands. The policy-makers could take the opportunity to make a concrete formulation of the problem against the background of the dream of the new Europe. A comparison of the results with other <b>allochtonous</b> groups in the Netherlands is also of social relevance: an analysis of the socialisation of Greek pupils can throw light on the position of other groups of <b>allochtonous</b> pupils. Apart from this, a theoretical need is also being served. Research into the cultural conditions in both societies is important from both a sociological and educational viewpoint. ...|$|E
40|$|The eastern {{periphery}} of the Russian Platform houses an exceptional record of the Jurassic/Cretaceous transition, which is represented by very thin sandstone beds. The presence of glaucony grains, phosphorite concretions and shark teeth indicates that the transitional sediments constitute a condensed succession, although the <b>allochtonous</b> origin of the glaucony grains in itself is not a reliable indicator. The combination with thin ammonite zones and a strongly diminished sedimentation rate, as low as ~ 0. 05 cm/ka are, however, convincing evidence. The Jurassic/Cretaceous transitional deposits accumulated in a basin the depth of which decreased simultaneously with a global eustatic sea-level fall. This coincidence suggests that condensed successions may form in shallowing environments, which contradicts the sequence-stratigraphic concept. Considering {{the character of the}} sediments under study, it appears that both stratigraphic and taphonomic condensation patterns occur {{in this part of the}} eastern Russian Platform...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the climate and}} environmental variability of Northern Chilean Patagonia during the Last Millennia, using a multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core from Lago Esponja (45 ° 09 ’S, 72 ° 08 ’W). The lake {{is located in the}} region of Aysen del General Carlos Ibanez del Campo, in NW Patagonia. The study focuses on a multiproxy analysis of sedimentary records. The longest core (150 cm long) was collected in 2014 at 40 m depth. The sediment, which is composed of light brown organic-rich clayey silt, was analyzed for sedimentology (grain size, magnetic susceptibility organic matter and biogenic silica content), mineralogy (X-ray diffraction) and geochemistry (elemental and isotopic analyses of C and N, XRF core-scaner at 1 mm resolution). The radiocarbon ages, measured on 3 macro-remains, demonstrate that the core covers the last 6. 700 years. The sedimentation rate ranges between 0. 1 mm/yr in the lower section (100 - 150 cm) and 0. 4 mm/yr in the upper meter. Visual descriptions and Scopix radiographies show that the sediment record is finely laminated except a massive decimetric coarser and darker layer corresponding to a tephra (estimated age 700 AD± 50). Magnetic susceptibility (confirmed by scopix radiographies) highlights the presence of 8 additional millimetric tephra layers. The biogenic silica content of the sediment is low (mean 5 %). Diatom assemblage is dominated by benthic and acidophilous species, with high saprobic values. None marked changes were observed regarding the dynamic of the lake. The high organic matter content (mean 15 %) and its high C/N ratio (12. 7) throughout the core indicate inputs of <b>allochtonous</b> and terrestrial organic matter. Such parameters present high sediment variability also marked by changes in the chemical composition. The laminations reflect changes in the <b>allochtonous</b> sedimentary inputs, with high terrestrial inputs during wetter conditions in relation with the Westerlies. The sedimentary records of Lago Esponja will be compared with Eastern lacustrine record from the same latitude in order to confirm the climate-driven record...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{utilization of}} organic matter was investigated during two cruises made in the north-western Black Sea {{in the summer of}} 1995 and in the winter-spring transition period (April-May 1997). Bacterial biomass and activities (enzymatic activity and production) as well as direct (dissolved and particulate organic carbon) and indirect (primary production) sources of organic carbon for bacteria were measured along high resolution salinity gradients and a spatial grid in the Danube-Black Sea mixing zone and in the Black Sea marine waters. Despite little change in bacterial biomass, bacterial activity displayed significant spatio-temporal variations. Bacterial production was maximal in the Danube-Black Sea mixing zone in July 1995. In this area, the source {{of organic matter}} for heterotrophic bacteria can be derived from autochtonous production and/or from <b>allochtonous</b> inputs. Total potential organic carbon sources were always higher in the Danube-Black Sea mixing zone than in the Black Sea marine waters, particularly due to high primary production and particulate organic carbon concentrations recorded in this mixing zone. Interestingly, dissolved organic carbon concentrations along the salinity gradients were uniform. A seasonal constant accumulation of DOC was, however, observed in the whole area investigated from 2000 mgC m - 3 in April 1997 to 3000 mgC m - 3 in July 1995. The relative contribution of the various sources of organic carbon to the bacterial carbon demand was analysed. In April 1997, the bacterial carbon demand could be satisfied only by the <b>allochtonous</b> sources of organic matter discharged by the Danube. In May 1997, the contribution of autochtonous phytoplankton-derived organic carbon was expected to increase due to the general enhancement of biological activity. In July 1995, direct sources of organic carbon were barely enough to satisfy the bacterial needs. The excess of dissolved organic carbon accumulated during the winter-spring period is assumed to support the high bacterial carbon demand of summer. Indirect evidence suggests that this delayed utilization of dissolved organic matter could be due to PO 4 limitation of bacterial growth. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
