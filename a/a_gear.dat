5|$|On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, {{attempted}} a go-around when the crew experienced troubles with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> indicator. When thrust was applied, the low pressure turbine disc in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; {{parts of the}} disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control pushers for both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. <b>A</b> <b>gear</b> change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|E
5|$|As {{their plans}} to emigrate step up <b>a</b> <b>gear,</b> Lewis forges a plan to steal money from Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) betting shop by cashing fraudulently franked betting slips. His scam is successful, and he cheats on Audrey when he kisses Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Lewis flees the UK; he made his last {{appearance}} on 13 August 2010. Just over a year later, it was announced Havers would reprise his role as Lewis and return to Coronation Street in February 2012. Havers believed Lewis would be a changed man who wanted to apologise to those he had hurt. The character's first period in the show was well received by television critics. On 22 January 2013, {{it was announced that}} Havers would be leaving Coronation Street once again and Lewis departed on 1 February 2013.|$|E

5000|$|Pratt & Whitney first {{attempted}} to build <b>a</b> <b>geared</b> turbofan starting around 1998, with the PW8000. This essentially was an upgrade {{of the existing}} PW6000 that replaced the fan section with <b>a</b> <b>gearing</b> system and new single-stage fan. [...] After several years of development the PW8000 essentially disappeared.|$|R
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1944 Specht {{was awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his 30 {{victories}} on the Western Front. On 15 April after his commander, Hermann Graf was injured, he gave up his command of II./JG 11, {{and moved to the}} Geschwaderstab (Wing Command flight) as Kommodore-in-training, under Herbert Ihlefeld. Promoted to major on 1 May, he was given full command of JG 11 on 15 May, replacing Ihlefeld who was himself transferred to command JG 1. But little could be done as the Allied bombing offensive stepped up <b>a</b> <b>gear.</b> His units were decimated over the skies of Normandy in June and July. He himself was injured in July, suffering head injuries in yet another crash-landing. Despite severe pain from his injuries, Specht remained on combat duty. His wing was retired to the Rhineland to be rebuilt, but they were crushed again {{in the latter half of}} 1944. The Allies were now sending overwhelming numbers of bombers to destroy the German industrial and military factories and now protected by the advent of the P-51 Mustang, providing fighter cover right into the heart of the Reich and back.|$|E

25|$|Underbones are small-displacement {{motorcycles}} with a step-through frame, {{descendants of}} the original Honda Super Cub. They are differentiated from scooters by their larger wheels and their use of footpegs instead of a floorboard. They often have <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> shifter with an automatic clutch.|$|E
25|$|To change up <b>a</b> <b>gear,</b> {{the lever}} is pushed forward (against a spring pressure) towards the +, {{and to change}} down, the lever is pulled {{rearward}} towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This method of operation is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> {{when it is not}} appropriate (e.g., requesting a downshift when engine speed is near the redline) the DSG will not change to the driver's requested gear.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E

50|$|Factory {{certified}} {{aircraft engines}} have also used reduction units integral to their design. The Cessna 175 used <b>a</b> <b>geared</b> unit {{which is part}} of the Continental GO-300 engine while the Helio Courier and several Beechcraft twins, among others, used the geared Lycoming GO-435 and GO-480. Many light sport aircraft use engines from Rotax such as the Rotax 912 which incorporates <b>a</b> <b>geared</b> reducer.|$|R
50|$|Hub gearing {{permits the}} use of a fully {{enclosed}} chaincase, which minimizes the need for maintenance. <b>A</b> hub <b>gear</b> has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment. <b>A</b> hub <b>gear</b> system is heavier than a derailleur system. In <b>a</b> hub <b>gear</b> system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system. If <b>a</b> <b>geared</b> hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it.|$|R
25|$|A later {{variation}} uses {{two separate}} but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along {{the length of}} the input shaft and crankshaft centre line), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly. This latter clutch arrangement (unlike the other two variations) is driven by <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> from the engine crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} gear ratio. These {{bicycles}} are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> ratio of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|E

25|$|No Russian {{synchronization}} gears {{went into}} production before the 1917 Revolution – although experiments by Victor Dibovski in 1915 {{contributed to the}} later British Scarff-Dibovski gear (described above), and another naval officer, G.I. Lavrov, also designed <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> that was fitted to the unsuccessful Sikorsky S-16. French and British designs licence-built in Russia used the Alkan-Hamy or Birkigt gears.|$|E
25|$|The base model's SOHC {{inline-four}} engine produced 95hp (71kW) {{and had a}} 9.1:1 compression ratio. The {{more powerful}} 1990–1991 GSi used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130hp (97kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The GSi package also included driving lights, a spoiler, a rear anti-sway bar, and a transmission with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> ratio that was slightly better for acceleration than the base model's manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider.
