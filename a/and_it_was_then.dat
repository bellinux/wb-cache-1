The thatched stone building is rented to a tenant and has limited public access.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke {{has a wide}} {{diversity}} for musical groups {{ranging from}} brass bands to symphony orchestras. The Basingstoke Concert Band is a traditional wind band which has now been in existence for more than 35 years. The band was started by Lawrie Shaw when Brighton Hill Community School opened in Basingstoke in 1975 {{where he was the}} first headteacher. Lawrie formed the band as an evening class for amateur wind players <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band. In the years immediately after World War II the Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra was being conducted by D. Cecil Williams.|$|E
5|$|For the Muslim sepoys in the 5th Light Infantry, {{interaction}} with Kasim Mansur, {{who was an}} Indian Muslim merchant in Singapore, served to fuel this sense of divided loyalties further. Kasim Mansur together with a local imam, Nur Alam Shah, would often host members of the 5th Light Infantry at Mansur’s home <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> that the duo persuaded the Muslim sepoys {{to adhere to the}} fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan and to turn their guns against their British commanding officers and contribute towards the war against these kafirs who were battling their Muslim brothers who were defending the Caliphate in the West. It was within this context that the plan was hatched for the mutiny.|$|E

5|$|In Presbyterian {{worship the}} sermon, {{which could be}} several hours long, was seen as central, meaning that {{services}} tended to have a didactic and wordy character. There were also Bible readings and the only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> repeated by the congregation. From {{the second quarter of}} the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. These innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public {{was not made}} aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (<b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E
5|$|The airport opened as a {{combined}} sea and land airport, serving {{both domestic and}} international destinations. It replaced the land airport at Kjeller and the sea airport at Gressholmen. In 1940, it {{was taken over by}} the German Luftwaffe, but civilian air services began again in 1946 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> taken over by the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration. The airport at first had three runways, each at , but these were gradually expanded, first the north–south runway and finally the east–west one to the current length in 1962. The same year the terminal moved south to the final location. A large-scale expansion to the terminal was made during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} shadow of Saltwell Towers {{there is a}} maze, built in 1877 by Wailes for his family's use. The maze was replanted with yew trees {{as part of the}} 2005 {{regeneration}} project to the original plans laid by Wailes. Also renovated was Saltwell Dene, a picturesque wooded area with a stream, bridges, cascades and a lily pond which inspired local artist Thomas Miles Richardson to paint a watercolour of it in the 19thcentury. Saltwell Dene was the final part of the 21stcentury restoration project to be completed, reopening to the public in March 2005. At either end of the Broadwalk there are two wooden shelters whilst the centre of the Broadwalk is marked by the Almond Pavilion. The pavilion was opened in 1881 and was a refreshment pavilion for decades before it fell into disrepair; by the 1980s it was derelict <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> completely destroyed by fire. It has been fully reconstructed, including a replica of the original clock tower, and is once more a refreshment kiosk with new toilet facilities. It offers panoramic views into the northern fields and across the boating lake. An oriental garden was opened in 2011 to mark the twenty-year anniversary of the twinning arrangement between Gateshead and Komatsu. This includes a gravel pond, waterfalls and stone lanterns. The park is also host to three well-used bowling greens, replete with their own pavilion (the Avenue Green Pavilion) and a rose garden.|$|E
5|$|When {{the parts}} for a Hamilcar were {{completed}} and the glider was erected, it was flown to RAF North Luffenham in Rutland {{to have its}} specific cargo placed on board, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> flown to RAF Tarrant Rushton, which had been selected as the Hamilcar training and operational base in November 1943. It {{was not possible to}} tow the glider empty, so any empty gliders usually carried Universal Carriers or concrete blocks as ballast. Training with the Hamilcar appears to have taken place primarily at RAF Tarrant Rushton, and began sometime between the end of 1943 and the first months of 1944. Hamilcar training began with dual instruction, where an instructor accompanied the pilots for several hours, and then moved onto flying solo flights. Most of this training consisted of 'circuits and bumps', where the pilots practised controlling the glider as it took off from an airfield under tow, and then landing it after the tow rope was detached; cross-country navigation was also practised. It was common practice for members of airlanded units to be inside the gliders as cargo when training took place, although there is evidence that tank crews only acted as cargo for one or two flights, probably due to the risk of accidents which might cost the lives of specialised troops and equipment. Those flights that tank crews did experience usually consisted of gliders landing on carefully marked airfields instead of the open countryside to minimise the risks involved, and also make recovery of the glider easier. Accidents do not seem to have been a common occurrence. During training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps, which specialised in flying Hamilcars, over 2800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First and Second World Wars, the shows were halted from 1914 to 1920 and again between 1940 and 1946, but have been held every year since. The hundredth Howden Show was held in 1979 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> that it became a two-day event.|$|E

Some historians see a more gradual development for the Rosary, in that the repetition of Marian prayers which form the basis of the Rosary needed counting devices, which resulted in the modern form of the Rosary prayed on beads.|$|E

His mother, Anna Pavlovna (née Moskaleva; 1893–1963), was from a landowning family, {{and at one point}} had been a pupil of her future husband. In 1918, when Richter's parents were in Odessa, the Civil War separated them from their son, and Richter moved in with his aunt Tamara.
