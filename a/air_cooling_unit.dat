Due {{to working}} in natural {{environment}} {{in a long}} term and dust deposited on the surface, air cooling radiator turns to a lower heat transfer rate, so that it leads to load limit operation for <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> in summer. In allusion to indirect air cooling radiator with Heller System, high-pressure water jet technique is used and built-in cleaning device is designed to entirely solve above-mentioned problem. Cleaning device works automatically and realizes full cover cleaning. Cleaning-pressure is between 100 and 150 bar and cleaning target distance keeps within 200 mm. Dust on the surface of radiator can be entirely cleaned. Cleaning flow is 20 m 3 /h and the cleaning cost decreases greatly. Such device has been successfully tested and worked.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The South African mining {{industry}} {{is faced with}} the depletion of minerals and coal at current mining depths. This is forcing the industry to expand operations to greater depths where ample ore reserves are located. This expansion combined with the demand for increased production rates puts excessive strain on the ventilation and cooling systems of mines. The problem is that mining will eventually reach depths where current methods of ventilation and cooling {{will no longer be}} economical and practical to provide an acceptable working environment. To solve this problem new technologies or alternative cooling methods are required. One such concept is called spot cooling. This entails cooling the air in a remote location rather than cooling the entire environment leading up to that location. Until now spot cooling was primarily done using chilled water but a significant limitation of this approach is that the cooling effectiveness is proportional to the chilled water temperature. An alternative solution is the use of a localised refrigeration plant acting as a spot cooler. This is different from a standard underground refrigeration plant since it is modular with a smaller cooling capacity and is completely mobile {{so that it can be}} deployed at different locations as the need arises. The purpose of this study is to develop such a prototype modular <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> (ACU) to establish a suitable working environment and to evaluate the techno-economic impact if it is applied on a wide scale for deep mine expansion. Furthermore, from an electrical supply side the potential of the ACU to contribute to energy efficiency (EE) and demand side management (DSM) initiatives is also investigated. A nominal 80 kW prototype ACU was designed, manufactured and tested in both laboratory conditions and within an underground mining environment. A distinct advantage of the unit is that it can operate efficiently with high inlet water temperatures. This provides enhanced flexibility compared to existing technologies since it can utilise normal service water as heat sink as opposed to chilled water as a source of cooling. A system simulation model was developed to investigate the deep mining techno-economic impact as well as the EE and DSM potential of the ACU compared to existing chilled water technology. An investigation into the DSM and energy efficiency potential of a modular underground <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> applied in the South African {{mining industry}}. School of Mechanical Engineering. North-West University Information and data from a case study mine were used to simulate different possible cooling configurations for deep mine expansion. From the results two configurations emerged that show the best potential for deep mine application, namely an underground chiller plant combined with chilled water cooling cars (CWCs) or a hot underground dam with ACUs. Of these two configurations only the ACU configuration holds significant EE and DSM potential due to a reduction in the total power requirement and it is also by far the most cost effective. This could provide substantial benefits for both the mining industry and the South African electrical supply utility, Eskom. From the results of this study it can be concluded that the ACU technology offers an energy efficient, cost effective and practical alternative to conventional cooling methods for deep mine expansion where the establishment of an acceptable working environment is a major concern.

Cooling the air intake to the compressor has been widely used to mitigate this shortcoming. Energy and exergy analysis of a GT Brayton cycle coupled to a refrigeration <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> shows a promise for increasing the output power with a little decrease in thermal efficiency. A thermo-economics algorithm is developed to estimate the economic feasibility of the cooling system. The analysis is applied to an open cycle, HITACHI-FS 7001 B GT plant at the industrial city of Yanbu (Latitude 24 o 05 ” N and longitude 38 o E) by the Red Sea in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Result show that the enhancement in output power depends on the degree of chilling the air intake to the compressor (a 12 - 22 K decrease is achieved). For this case study, maximum power gain ratio (PGR) is 15. 46 % (average of 12. 25 %), at an insignificant decrease in thermal efficiency. The second law analysis show that the exergetic power gain ratio drops to an average 8. 5 %. The cost of adding the air cooling system is also investigated and a cost function is derived that incorporates time-dependent meteorological data, operation characteristics of the GT and the air intake cooling system and other relevant parameters such as interest rate, lifetime, and operation and maintenance costs.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. As mining explores greater depths beyond 4000 m at Mponeng Mine the {{challenges}} of obtaining suitable working environments and complying with regulations becomes significant. These depths mean a considerable increase in the virgin rock temperature and the surrounding working environment. By law the mine is obligated to provide working temperatures not exceeding 32 °C wet bulb. This then necessitates {{the need for an}} effective cooling medium that not only has a great efficiency but should also be sustainable in the current economical environment faced with power supply shortages. Currently the advantages of ice are explored on Mponeng Below 120 level (120 L) project with great effect. Due to the energy in the latent heat of fusion process, savings arise from lower pumping costs and conventional refrigeration plants are already being phased out. When applied in closed loop (U - tube) water cooling systems, colder water temperatures can be obtained at the working face. Currently Mponeng Mine is using Conventional Cooling Cars (CWC) that are similar in design to radiators for extracting heat from the working areas. The system absorbs the heat at the cooling car and rejects it in the fridge plants. If water temperatures raise this system is ineffective and costly from the loss of production. A solution for this problem {{comes in the form of}} a modular <b>Air</b> <b>Cooling</b> <b>Unit</b> (ACU) based on heat pump technology that was designed for use as a localised cooling unit. It allows for high supply water temperatures and provides cooling in the region of 100 kW. The study focuses on simulating the ACU in the proposed closed loop system for the Carbon Leader (CL) project and evaluating it with conventional cooling methods. Five different configurations between the 500 kW conventional cooler and 300 kW ACU are looked at and economically evaluated for the total life cycle costing (LCC). The study indicates that in a closed loop system that uses ice as the cooling medium CWCs is the best economical option. However ACUs proved to be economically the best method for cooling in two cases. Firstly in development ends and secondly using the warm return water to do additional underground cooling between the settlers and hot return water pumps. Based on the results from the study Mponeng should look into installing ACUs between the settlers and hot water dams as this scenario had the best net present value cost of all the simulations done.

Following a successful demonstration of a heat pump in 2001 funds {{were given to the}} School of Engineering at London's London South Bank University to develop a prototype; work began in April 2002. A prize of £100,000 was offered by the Mayor of London during the hot summer of 2003 for a solution to the problem, but the competition ended in 2005 without a winner. A year-long trial of a groundwater cooling system began in June 2006 at Victoria station. The University's system comprised three fan coil units that use water that has seeped into the tunnels and is pumped from the tunnels to absorb the heat after which it is discharged in the sewer system.

The most common applied statistical distributions in reliability settings are the standard (2 parameter) Weibull and Gamma distributions. Reliability estimations and predictions are used to evaluate, when the estimation of distributionsparameters is done. To estimate good operating condition in a building, the reliability of the air conditioning system that supplies conditioned air to the several companies’ departments is checked.

This large-scale system, named Columbia, consists of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 512 -processor systems, {{for a total of}} 10, 240 Intel Itanium- 2 processors. High-fidelity CFD simulations were performed for the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) computer room at Ames Research Center. The purpose of the simulations was to assess the adequacy of the existing air handling and conditioning system and make recommendations for changes {{in the design of the}} system if needed. The simulations were performed with NASA's OVERFLOW- 2 CFD code which utilizes overset structured grids. A new set of boundary conditions were developed and added to the flow solver for modeling the roomls air-conditioning and proper cooling of the equipment. Boundary condition parameters for the flow solver are based on cooler CFM (flow rate) ratings and some reasonable assumptions of flow and heat transfer data for the floor and central processing units (CPU). The geometry modeling from blue prints and grid generation were handled by the NASA Ames software package Chimera Grid Tools (CGT). This geometric model was developed as a CGT-scripted template, which can be easily modified to accommodate any changes in shape and size of the room, locations and dimensions of the CPU racks, disk racks, coolers, power distribution units, and mass-storage system. The compute nodes are grouped in pairs of racks with an aisle in the middle. High-speed connection cables connect the racks with overhead cable trays. The <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> from the <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> is pumped into the computer room from a sub-floor through perforated floor tiles.

The thermal non-equilibrium model of heat transfer in porous media was applied both to the bed of vegetables and to the heat exchanger of the cooler. The heat and mass transfer coefficients in the bed of cabbage and in the cooler were treated as field quantities. The results of calculations were applied to the preparations of experimental evaluation of heat and mass transfer in the real cold store...|$|R

The effect of using the cold production process for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> on the off-design performance of a gas turbine combined cycle was analyzed under different ambient conditions. The cold output of the proposed process was increased by about 38. 1 % to 42. 5 % {{compared to that of}} the conventional cold production process that involves direct LNG evaporation. Furthermore for the inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> the proposed method increased the relative power increment from 2. 2 % to 14. 4 % and the relative efficiency increment from 0. 7 % to 2. 2 %, mainly depending on the variations in the relative humidity, compared to cold production without <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The relative power and relative efficiency of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> were increased by 0. 6 % to 3. 1 % and 0. 3 % to 0. 5 %, respectively, above those of the traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R
