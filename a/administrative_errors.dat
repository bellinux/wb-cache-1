However it was revealed weeks later that Pervan’s transfer had broken down due to <b>administrative</b> <b>errors.</b> Among those returning from the previous season were Heat Captain, Mike Martin, point-guard, EJ Harrison, and shooting guard, Dean Williams, while Heat fan-favourite Chad McKnight also rejoined the Heat after a one-year stint at the Leicester Riders.

25|$|In June 2016 it was {{reported}} in the Times Higher Education {{that as a result of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> hundreds of students who studied at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute between 2005–6 and 2013–14 had been given the wrong marks, leading to an unknown number of students being attributed with the wrong qualifications and, in some cases, being failed when they should have passed their degrees. A report by UCL’s Academic Committee Review Panel noted that, according to the Institute’s own review findings, senior members of UCL staff had been aware of issues affecting students' results but had not taken action to address them. The Review Panel concluded that there had been an apparent lack of ownership of these matters amongst the Institute’s senior staff.|$|E
2500|$|An {{appropriately}} interested person, such as {{a losing}} candidate, may question the result (the [...] "return of the writ") in a federal election by a petition to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns, normally within 40 days of the result. [...] A petition can also be filed by the Australian Electoral Commission. [...] The High Court may hear the whole case itself or may delegate factual questions for determination by the Federal Court; the High Court itself will determine the validity of a candidate's election or of the whole of that particular election, including issues of constitutional interpretation. [...] The admissible grounds for a petition are generally at the Court's discretion but include corruption and do not extend to <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> that have not affected the result. [...] The Court can compel production of documents and attendance of witnesses, and can examine witnesses on oath. [...] However, the Court [...] "must make its decision on a petition as quickly as is reasonable in the circumstances", it is not bound by strict rules of evidence, {{and all of its}} decisions [...] "shall be final and conclusive and without appeal, and shall not be questioned in any way" [...] (thus there is no recourse to the High Court in its other capacities or to the Parliament).|$|E

2500|$|During 1995, Onslow was {{deployed}} to South East Asia. During this deployment, the personnel of Onslow {{were involved in}} a controversial line-crossing ceremony while operating near the equator. During this particular ceremony, normally intended to induct new sailors into the 'court of King Neptune', the victims were verbally and physically abused, had their pelvises and genitals covered in what was described as a [...] "blistering concoction", then thrown overboard and forced to stay there until the rest of the company permitted them on board. When one of the victimised sailors complained to superiors, he became subject to several <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> and inconveniences, {{to the point where he}} was forced to resign a year later. The sailor acquired a copy of a videotape made of the ceremony and presented it to the Nine Network, which broke the story on 6 July 1999. An inquiry into the incident aboard Onslow was held, which found that although guidelines had been developed in the years after the incident to prevent harassment in the Australian Defence Force, disciplinary charges against the sailors involved could not be laid, as more than three years had passed since the offence. The inquiry also stated that while line-crossing ceremonies would continue to be held aboard RAN vessels, they would be supervised by a non-involved member of the crew to prevent similar extreme situations developing. The deployment ended in December, with Onslow visiting her namesake town for the last time on her return to Australia.|$|E

50|$|Host-based zoning {{is usually}} {{referred}} to as persistent binding or LUN, and is perhaps the least implemented form of zoning. Because it requires the host configuration to be correct {{in order to avoid}} zoning conflicts, this form of zoning creates a greater opportunity for <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> and conflicting access to targets. Moreover zoning interfaces vary among different host operating systems and HBA's — increasing the possibility for <b>administrative</b> <b>errors.</b> If a host is not configured with the zoning software, it can access all devices in the fabric and create an even higher probability of data corruption. Host-based zoning is often used when clusters are implemented to control the mapping of devices to specific target IDs. However, it should never be the only form of zoning. Augmenting host-based zoning with storage- and fabric-based zoning is the only acceptable method to reliably control device access and data security.|$|E

50|$|The {{implementation}} of SaaS inventory management software, like Megaventory or Cin7, {{has become a}} valuable tool for organizations looking to efficiently manage stock. While the capabilities of applications vary, most inventory management applications give organizations a structured method of accounting for all incoming and outgoing inventory within their facilities. Organizations save a significant amount in costs associated with manual inventory counts, <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> and reductions in inventory stock-outs.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{in retail}} trade, leakage, or {{shrinkage}} {{can also be}} the loss of stock without payment, usually due to fraud by employees or shoplifters. The opposite of leakage would be displaced sales. Sources of shrinkage may also be <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> or vendor fraud, which is least possible. In the retail industry, it is widely accepted that 2-3% of revenue is lost every year due to shrinkage. The majority of large retailers {{refer to it as}} 'acceptable cost of trading'. When the shrinkage is due to employee theft usually this occurred at the point of sale terminal.|$|E

50|$|The {{design project}} and {{planning}} began in 1957 {{at the request}} of Rowley Pym and progressed quickly due to his enthusiasm. The capital used to fund construction was drawn from pre-sales of units, prompting an unprecedented level of media attention to the tower. The project was considerably rushed, encountering many financial difficulties and <b>administrative</b> <b>errors.</b> Torbreck Kratzman Pty Ltd., the company formed to build the apartments declared bankruptcy prior to the construction of the tower block, and the project was sold to Reid Murray Developments in 1959, which consequently went into liquidation before the project was completed.|$|E
