5|$|As Secretary of State in the Obama {{administration}} from 2009 to 2013, Clinton {{responded to the}} <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring,</b> during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya.

40|$|Started {{with similar}} social backgrounds, the <b>Arab</b> <b>Springs</b> have soon showed their peculiarities and differences. After the {{original}} requests for better living conditions, jobs opportunities and the restraint of rapacious and corrupted bureaucracies, the post-revolutionary process {{has seen the}} rise in power of the Islamic Brotherhood and other Islamic parties, but also their incapacity to control internal economies, tribal powers and democratic dynamics. Their failure has produced dramatic consequences: military restoration in Egypt, civil war in Syria, anarchy in Libya, while the dissolution of national security systems has helped infiltration of jihadist and terrorist groups in the Sub-Saharian Africa. The political and financial attention paid by Gulf Petro-monarchies and by Iran to <b>Arab</b> <b>Springs</b> for enlarging their soft power in the Region has reactivated the ancient Sunni-Shia and Muslim Brotherhood-Salafist confrontation. In spite of these competitions, new regimes in Maghreb have not, for the moment, dramatically changed their regional and international relation...|$|R

Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring</b> that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring</b> have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of the <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring</b> in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then {{threatened}} by the Tunisian Revolution. He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there. Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventative measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several Islamist prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30%.|$|E
40|$|Migrants return {{intentions}} are {{directly linked to}} the integration in the receiving country {{but also to the}} migratory project that is behind the initial migration and to the presence (or absence) of family members in the country of origin (or destination). The latter may imply the so called “pendulum migration” (de Haas H., Fokkema T., 2010), i. e. migrants that spend a part of the year in their country of origin, even if they reside legally in Europe where they {{spend the rest of the}} year. The aim of this work is to shed light on return intentions of the North African migrants in Italy, exploring their evolution eventually linked to the <b>Arab</b> <b>springs.</b> In order to answer to our research questions, we use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. We lead a quantitative multivariate analysis on return intention of North Africans migrants in Italy, based on the 2009 Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). Qualitative analysis based on interviews to North Africans migrants in Italy will be used to better understand the “pendulum migration” phenomenon and the consequence of <b>Arab</b> <b>springs</b> on return intentions...|$|R
30|$|The <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring’s</b> human toll, {{particularly}} in Syria, {{is perhaps the}} strongest illustration of {{the scale of the}} upheaval. The official UN death toll in the Syrian conflict presently stands at over 100, 000. The number is less than the 120, 000 in Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003 [2], but the Syrian deaths occurred in just over 2  years time. With no end to the fighting in sight, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the final death toll will be considerably higher.|$|R

5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring,</b> Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched {{a crackdown on}} the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1999, Abdullah II {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah {{embarked}} on aggressive economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring,</b> including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|The banking {{sector is}} one of the {{principal}} foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring</b> uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector currently consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring's</b> {{hallmarks}} of volatility and ‘youthfulness’ thwart sustained development, political cohesion and peace. Demographic ‘youthfulness’, due to recent high fertility, {{is accompanied by}} rapid growth. But the backstory is even bleaker. Cohort flows, producing large population waves, batter successive life-cycle stages, generating demands for services, markets, resources and capital. To overcome this, policies directed at youth (15 – 24) are pivotal; failure to integrate youth into the economy and society results in disadvantaged middle-aged parenting populations. This threatens longer-term, sustainable development and triggers political volatility. Yet, as is shown in this article, the international development community has failed to formulate appropriate strategies...|$|R

5|$|The tourism {{sector is}} {{considered}} a cornerstone of the economy, being a large source of employment, hard currency and economic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan. The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion with the inclusion of medical tourists. The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries. The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence. The most recent blow to the tourism sector {{was caused by the}} <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring,</b> which scared off tourists from the entire region.

5|$|Bahrain is {{the site}} of the ancient Dilmun civilisation. It has been famed since antiquity for its pearl fisheries, which were {{considered}} {{the best in the world}} into the 19th century. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam (628). Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty under the Persian Empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah clan captured Bahrain from Nasr Al-Madhkur and it has since been ruled by the Al Khalifa royal family, with Ahmed al Fateh as Bahrain's first hakim. In the late 1800s, following successive treaties with the British, Bahrain became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. In 1971, Bahrain declared independence. Formerly an emirate, Bahrain was declared a Kingdom in 2002. In 2011, the country experienced protests inspired by the regional <b>Arab</b> <b>Spring.</b>|$|E

Protests continued for a month reaching over 100,000 participants in a nation of about 500,000 citizens, until more than a thousand troops and police from the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived at the request of government and a three-month state of emergency was declared. Authorities then cracked down on the protests. However, smaller-scale protests and clashes continued to occur almost daily, mostly in areas outside Manama's business districts, with some rare marches {{in the center of the}} capital city. As of April 2012, more than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising and as of January 2013, near-daily clashes between protesters and police are ongoing.|$|E

Then he stood erect upon the swaying branch a hundred feet above the ground, and, raising one of the Arab guns to his shoulder, took careful aim and fired. With the report the Arab who was urging on his men to burn the village fell in his tracks, and the Manyuema threw away their torches and fled from the village. The last Tarzan saw of them they were racing toward the jungle, while their former masters knelt upon the ground and fired at them.|$|R

Without halting for a moment the square kept on its way until the front line reached the bushes.
