5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health <b>and</b> <b>retirement</b> benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health <b>and</b> <b>retirement</b> benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E

5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health <b>and</b> <b>retirement</b> funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health <b>and</b> <b>retirement</b> benefits for its workers.|$|E
5|$|Credit Suisse {{developed}} the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused {{exclusively on the}} chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension <b>and</b> <b>retirement</b> products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E

In return Pittston was permitted to operate {{seven days a week}} {{as long as they were}} closed from 8am–4pm on Sundays. Miners were also put on a rotating schedule where every 28 days they would work one week for 4 days, 10 hours each day.|$|E

5|$|The UMWA {{took action}} against Pittston's new plan of {{operation}} {{and offered to}} reach a settlement.

The refusal to renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E

5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder <b>and</b> <b>retirement</b> stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E

40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are expensive}} items, and a utility must decide {{when it is}} economically preferable to replace one, or when to invest in refurbishments or repairs. The expected probability of failure of a transformer is often used in this determination. A challenge frequently encountered by a utility when analyzing their power transformer data is that because this failure rate is so low, a population size larger than they own is required to make meaningful statistical conclusions. For the Australian region such extensive surveys are uncommon. International surveys have been produced on mode and probability of failure, but it is unknown how representative the data is for Australian usage. Consequently, a study was performed where the Australian utilities were surveyed to find the number of failures <b>and</b> <b>retirements,</b> <b>and</b> the age, when this occurred. Data on 630 failures <b>and</b> <b>retirements</b> was collected <b>and</b> then analysed. Proportions of failure modes are presented and discussed in this article...|$|R
