5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a legged robot designed for general locomotion of complex terrain but specialized for dynamical, high-speed climbing of a uniformly convex cylindrical structure, such as <b>an</b> outdoor <b>telephone</b> <b>pole.</b> This robot, the RiSE V 3 climbing machine—mass 5. 4 kg, length 70 cm, excluding a 28 cm tail appendage—includes several novel mechanical features, including novel linkage designs for its legs and a non-backdrivable, energy-dense power transmission to enable high-speed climbing. We summarize the robot’s design and document a climbing behavior that achieves rapid ascent of <b>a</b> wooden <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> at 21 cm/s, a speed previously unachieved—and, we believe, heretofore impossible—with a robot of this scale. The behavioral gait of the robot employs the mechanical design to propel the body forward while passively maintaining yaw, pitch, and roll stability during climbing locomotion. The robot’s general-purpose legged design coupled with its specialized ability to quickly gain elevation and park at a vertical station silently with minimal energy consumption suggest potential applications including search and surveillance operations as well as ad hoc networking.

[...] After a wedding trip, the couple {{initially}} settled in Indianapolis. [...] Although Hogan's obituary makes no reference to children, {{he and his wife}} evidently raised an adopted child, Amy M. Hogan (born Amy Deagon), who {{died at the age of}} 16 in a 1921 automobile accident. A front-page article in the Vindicator reported that Amy Hogan was one of three passengers in an automobile whose driver had failed to slow down at a curve in the road and skidded into <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> near Hubbard, Ohio. [...] The article noted that Amy Hogan had recently graduated from Ursuline Academy and described her as [...] "a girl of exceptional talents, being especially prominent in local amateur theatricals and entertainments". [...] Records at Youngstown's Calvary Cemetery show that Amy Hogan was buried in the same plot as her adoptive parents. [...] Published cemetery records also suggest that Martin Hogan's wife, Agnes Hogan, gave birth to an unnamed infant, who died on September 6, 1898. [...] The infant was buried in a section of the cemetery usually reserved for unbaptized children and the indigent. [...] Agnes (Hogan) Moreland died on February 7, 1950, in Salem, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns from}} Outward Bound manager training—where {{he became more}} [...] "decisive and confident"—hoping for revenge on Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for commandeering his job during the {{previous}} spring. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline {{in the parking lot}} and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>pole,</b> but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act. While everyone is outside crowding around Dwight, Jim calls up his old college friend and tells him that he wants {{to be involved in the}} new business deal, even though he did not have Pam's approval.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely {{critical}} review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris wrote [...] "with its trip into blatant religiosity, 'All Souls' comes {{off like a}} bad episode of Millennium". Furthermore, she was critical of the scenes wherein the Nephilims' souls were taken, noting the excessive religious imagery: [...] "as [...] soul is taken, the camera pans {{to the right and}} stops to linger on <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> that forms a cross." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two derided the fact that the episode's killer appears to either be God or an angel commanded by God, along {{with the fact that the}} four girls are destined to die because they are disabled and [...] "have no right to live". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that, while religious worship is not a passive act, it is treated so in the episode. Ultimately, they concluded that while [...] "looking at death from a different angle is fascinating" [...] it would be explored better [...] "in 'Closure'." ...|$|E

Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, and Teddie one by one come to accept the parts of their psyches they rejected, which manifest as giant Shadows in the TV world, allowing them to wield Personas whilst each joins the group in turn. Mitsuo Kubo, a student from another high school who disappears following the death of Kinshiro Morooka, the protagonist's foul-mouthed homeroom teacher, claims credit for the murders; it is eventually learned that Kubo only killed Morooka and played no part in the other murders, having murdered Morooka simply to gain credit for the other murders.

Damage in this area was extreme, as many homes were [...] swept away completely, leaving only concrete slabs where the structures once stood. Damage surveyors noted that the remaining structural debris {{from some of the}} homes in this area was finely granulated into small fragments, and that trees and shrubs were completely debarked. A few of these homes were bolted to their foundations. Extensive ground scouring occurred, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from where they originated, including a mangled pickup truck that was found wrapped around <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>pole.</b> It was in this area that a mobile Doppler weather radar recorded winds of [...] within the tornado, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth.
