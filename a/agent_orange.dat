In 2003, the Vietnam Association of Victims of <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> (VAVA) was formed. In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> {{was tested}} by the United States in Thailand {{during the war in}} Southeast Asia.

5|$|<b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> was to {{a lesser}} extent used outside Vietnam. Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia was also sprayed with <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the Vietcong. Some countries, such as Canada, saw testing, while other countries, such as Brazil, used the herbicide to clear out sections of land for agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange.</b> In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, {{one of the first}} civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor. The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of chemicals {{present in the}} island's soil, together with resolutions passed by Guam's legislature, suggest that <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases Anderson Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Agana, Guam. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> was ever stored or used on Guam. Several Guam veterans have collected {{an enormous amount of}} evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange</b> used in Vietnam.|$|E
5000|$|Despite his {{significant}} scientific contributions, Kligman is {{best known}} for conducting human experiments on prisoners at Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia. Stemming from early testing of treatments for ringworm, his work there started with an effort to control athlete's foot at the invitation of prison officials. He found the environment fraught with possibilities, and undertook dozens of experiments on prisoners there for pharmaceutical companies and government agencies. Between 1951 and 1974, Kligman exposed approximately seventy-five prisoners at Holmesburg to high doses of dioxin, the contaminant responsible for <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange's</b> toxicity. Dow Chemical paid Kligman $10,000 to conduct the experiments on the toxicity effects of this chemical warfare agent. While the prisoners were paid for their participation, little effort was taken to assure the safety of the test subjects, some of whom were intentionally exposed to pathogens causing infections, including herpes, staphylococcus, and athlete's foot. Moreover, Kligman's payment of subjects had other unintended consequences: the economic power gained by subjects was used by some of them to [...] "coerce sexual favors from other inmates".|$|R

After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to kill for causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange's</b> attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that {{they are unable to}} absorb constructs made from violet light. She admits that revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans. In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated from the children she kept imprisoned on her back).

50|$|Larfleeze is enraged at this {{perceived}} {{violation of}} the agreement he has with the Guardians, as {{he is unable to}} see a distinction between them and the Controllers. At the time, Green Lantern Stel pursues a member of the Sinestro Corps, but is given pause when he crosses into the Vega system for sanctuary. Not willing to be stopped (despite the fact that Green Lanterns are barred from entering the system), Stel continues after his target. Upon entering the system, the Sinestro Corps member is devoured by <b>Agent</b> <b>Oranges</b> construct of Blume. Blume captures and seriously damages Stel, branding him with the symbol of the Orange Lantern Corps. When the Green Lanterns recover Stel and return him to Oa, a construct of Larfleeze bursts forth from the brand and confronts the Guardians about the attempt to steal the orange battery. Although the Guardians point out that the Controllers are the source of his anger, Larfleeze refuses to listen. He declares the treaty is null and void, and that the Guardians will submit to his demands or face his wrath. In response, the Guardian Scar destroys the projection and states that the Guardians do not negotiate with terrorists.|$|R

5000|$|Many bands {{knocked on}} the parking lot door of KROQ’s studio in Pasadena and handed Rodney a copy of their music. If he liked a track, such as <b>Agent</b> <b>Orange’s</b> 1979 hit “Bloodstains,” he would play that song within the hour. In 1978, guitarist Eddie Vincent and drummer Tad of The Hollywood Squares gave Rodney a copy of their just {{released}} 45 single at his studio door. Within minutes Bingenheimer introduced the mysterious group to his wide listening audience and played “Hillside Strangler.” The song promptly charted in Record World’s New Wave Hit Parade. Power pop band Candy (band) singer Kyle Vincent, {{who at the time}} was Kim Fowley's personal assistant, tells a similar story: [...] "We had just finished recording a few tracks with Kim producing. He told me to take one of the songs over to Rodney's studio, knock on the door, and tell him that Kim says we're the illegitimate sons of Rick Springfield and the Go-Gos. On the way back to my apartment Rodney talked about it and then played it. That was pretty historic for us." [...] Bingenheimer was credited for giving the group Broken Bottles a big break by playing their single Gothic Chicks.|$|R
