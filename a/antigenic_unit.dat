40|$|The {{dimensions}} of the specific combining regions of the antibody molecule (i. e., the combining sites) is of fundamental importance for {{an understanding of the}} mechanisms of antibody-antigen interaction, and the biological effects of these interactions. The work of Kabat (1) which utilized quantitative hapten inhibition methods, indicates that human anti-dextran antibody combining sites are sufficiently large to encompass an <b>antigenic</b> <b>unit</b> the size of a hexasaccharide. Similarly, Cebra's studies (2) indicates that rabbit anti-silk fibroin antibody-combining sites are complementary to an <b>antigenic</b> <b>unit</b> at]east the size of an octapeptide or a dodecapeptide. Several other works which examined rabbit anti-hapten antibodies by quantitative precipitation methods indicated {{that at least some of}} the anti-hapten antibody molecules possessed combining sites complementary to an <b>antigenic</b> <b>unit</b> comprised of hapten and adjoining carrier protein structures. (Haurowitz, p-azoarsanilic acid (3); Eisen et al., dinitrophenyl (4); and Buchanan-Davidson et al., synthetic polypeptides (5)).

It was demonstrated with the monospecific antibody thus produced that the liver aldolase of young adult (3 month) and aged (31 month) mice are antigenically identical. With the antibody, inactive enzyme molecules (crossreacting material) in liver homogenate of old mice were detected.

The original impetus to these investigations was the search for highly polymerized protein-like materials that could possibly be used as plasma volume expanders.

By the application of quantitative immunochemical studies with small polypeptides {{it may be possible}} to determine the size and structure of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>unit</b> and the nature of combining sites in the antibody.

40|$|Abstract: An {{intriguing}} {{difference between}} the E 2 glycoprotein of CSFV and the other groups of pestiviruses (nonCSFV) {{is a lack of}} two cysteine residues on positions cysteine 751 and 798. Other groups of pestivirus are not restricted to one species as swine, whereas CSFV is restricted to swine and wild boar. We constructed chimeric CSFV/BVDV E 2 genes based on a 2 D model of E 2 proposed by van Rijn et al. (van Rijn et al. 1994, J Virol 68, 3934 – 42) and confi rmed their expression by immunostaining of plasmid-transfected SK 6 cells. No equivalents for the <b>antigenic</b> <b>units</b> B/C and A were found on E 2 of BVDVII. This indicates major structural differences in E 2. However, the immunodominant BVDVII domain A, contain-ing epitopes with essential amino acids between position 760 – 764, showed to be dependent on the presence of the region defi ned by amino acids 684 to 796. As for the A domain of CSFV, the BVDVII A-like domain seemed to function as a separate unit. These combined domains in E 2 proved to be the only combination which was functional in viral background of CSFV C-strain. The fi tness of this virus (vfl c 36 BVDVII 684 – 796) seemed to be reduced compared to vfl c 9 (with the complete antigenic region of BVDVII) ...|$|R
40|$|Envelope {{glycoprotein}} E 2 is {{the most}} immunogenic protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). In a proposed model of the antigenic structure of E 2, the N-terminal half of E 2 forms two independent structural <b>antigenic</b> <b>units,</b> A and BC. E 2 without transmembrane region (E 2 -TMR) is expressed and secreted into the medium of insect cells by use of the baculovirus expression system. The immune response induced by E 2 protects pigs against CSFV. Recently, we showed that the protective immune response to a homologous CSFV challenge can be induced by a single unit, A or BC, of E 2. An indirect blocking ELISA, or complex trapping blocking assay (CTB) based on both units is routinely used worldwide for serological diagnosis of CSFV infections. Here we show that E 2 -TMR is secreted into the medium as a homodimer. This E 2 homodimer was used to develop a CTB detecting antibodies directed against one immunogenic unit of E 2. Thus, the protective immune response induced by E 2 containing one unit was not detected with a modified CTB based on the other unit, whereas immune responses induced {{by a variety of}} low virulent CSFV strains were detected with such a modified CTB. These results indicate that a deletion E 2 protein in combination with a modified CTB are feasible as CSF marker vaccine and accompanying differentiating diagnostic tes...|$|R
40|$|Rabbit {{antisera}} prepared against conjugates of the benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) bifunctional haptenic {{group were}} analyzed {{to determine whether}} the antibodies are adapted to only a portion of the large BPO molecule, or to the entire molecule, and whether specificity extends to the lysine side chain and adjoining structures of the immunizing carrier protein. No antibodies adapted to the phenylacetylamine portion of the BPO group could be detected in a pooled rabbit anti-BPO serum globulin fraction by PCA and quantitative precipitin analysis using several phenylacetylamine-protein conjugates as antigens. No antibodies adapted only to the thiazolidine carboxylic acid portion of the BPO molecule were detected in the anti-BPO globulin fraction using quantitative precipitin and hapten inhibition methods. At least the bulk of the anti-BPO antibodies was found to be adapted to the entire BPO haptenic group. By quantitative hapten inhibition of precipitation of the anti-BPO globulin fraction, the anti-BPO antibodies were found to show specificity for a 6 carbon amide side chain corresponding to the lysine side chain through which BPO groups are bound predominantly to protein. The contribution of this 6 carbon chain to antibody-hapten binding was small; (–ΔF°) was calculated to be 460 calories per mole (average). Rabbit anti-BPO antibodies prepared against BPO-rabbit serum albumin conjugates showed specificity also toward structures of the immunizing carrier protein, and possibly toward secondary or tertiary structural configurations. Penicilloyl conjugates of rabbit serum albumin precipitated from 3 individual rabbit antisera more anti-BPO antibodies than did penicilloyl conjugates of heterologous carriers (poly-L-lysine, human serum albumin, and human γ-globulin). Anti-BPO antibodies demonstrated heterogeneity with regard to closeness of fit to the haptenic group, or with regard to the dimensions of the combining sites, or both. It was concluded that at least a large part of anti-BPO antibodies are specifically adapted to a large <b>antigenic</b> <b>unit</b> comprised of the entire BPO group, the lysine side chain, and structural configurations of the immunizing carrier protein...|$|E

Recently Courts studied the effect of various treatments (thermal and proteolytic degradation) {{on the size of the}} peptide units derived from gelatin (4, 5).

Furthermore, ff the degradation products act as inhibitors for the gelatin-anfigelatin reaction it would lend further support to the specificity of the gelatin-antigelatin reaction. Materials and Methods Sera. [...] Pools of blood were obtained from pigs and horses at local slaughter houses. After obtaining the serum, it was handled with tterile precautions and in addition "merthiolate" to a concentration of 0. 01 per cent and phenol to 0. 25 per cent were added. All sera were stored in a deep freeze until use. Degradation Studies on Gelatin. [...] Thermal degradation: A 5 per cent solution of gelatin (Knox No. 1481 B) was prepared in distilled H 20. The pH of this solution was about 6. 5. Aliquots of the gelatin solution were adjusted to acid pH's with 2 ~ and 0. 1 ~ HCI and to alkaline pH's with 1. 5 N and 0. 1 N Na 0 H. As the desired pH was reached (pH 1 - 12) a 3 ml. aliquot was removed and placed in a tube in an ice bath. When the pH's of all the aliquots were properly adjusted, the tubes were sealed and placed in a 75 °C. water bath and heated for 24 hours according to the procedure of Courts (4).

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} that concerns chemistry is the design of molecules able to modulate protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, since these are involved in many physiological and pathological processes. The interactions occurring between proteins and their natural counterparts can take place through reciprocal recognition of rather large surface areas, through recognition of single contact points and single residues, through inclusion of the substrates in specific, more or less deep binding sites. In many cases, the design of synthetic molecules able {{to interfere with the}} processes involving proteins can benefit from the possibility of exploiting the multivalent effect. Multivalency, widely spread in Nature, consists in the simultaneous formation between two entities (cell-cell, cell-protein, protein-protein) of multiple equivalent ligand-recognition site complexes. In this way the whole interaction results particularly strong and specific. Calixarenes furnish a very interesting scaffold for the preparation of multivalent ligands and in the last years calixarene-based ligands demonstrated their remarkable capability to recognize and inhibit or restore the activity of different proteins, with a high efficiency and selectivity in several recognition phenomena. The relevance and versatility of these ligands is due to the different exposition geometries of the binding units that can be explored exploiting the conformational properties of these macrocycles, the wide variety of functionalities that can be linked to their structure at different distances from the aromatic units and to their intrinsic multivalent nature. With the aim of creating new multivalent systems for protein targeting, the work reported in this thesis regards the synthesis and properties of glycocalix[n]arenes and guanidino calix[4]arenes for different purposes. Firstly, a new bolaamphiphile glycocalix[4]arene in 1, 3 -alternate geometry, bearing cellobiose, was synthesized for the preparation of targeted drug delivery systems based on liposomes. The formed stable mixed liposomes obtained by mixing the macrocycle with DOPC were shown to be able of exploiting the sugar units emerging from the lipid bilayer to agglutinate Concanavalin A, a lectin specific for glucose. Moreover, always thanks to the presence of the glycocalixarene in the layer, the same liposomes demonstrated through preliminary experiments to be uptaken by cancer cells overexpressing glucose receptors on their exterior surface more efficiently respect to simple DOPC liposomes lacking glucose units in their structure. Then a small library of glycocalix[n]arenes having different valency and geometry was prepared, for the creation of potentially active immunostimulants against Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly the 19 F serotype, one of the most virulent. These synthesized glycocalixarenes bearing β-N-acetylmannosamine as <b>antigenic</b> <b>unit</b> were compared with the natural polysaccharide on the binding to the specific anti- 19 F human polyclonal antibody, to verify their inhibition potency. Among all, the glycocalixarene based on the conformationally mobile calix[4]arene resulted the more efficient ligand, probably due its major possibility to explore the antibody surface and dispose the antigenic units in a proper arrangement for the interaction process. These results pointed out the importance of how the different multivalent presentation in space of the glycosyl units can influence the recognition phenomena. At last, NMR studies, using particularly 1 H- 15 N HSQC experiments, were performed on selected glycocalix[6]arenes and guanidino calix[4]arenes blocked in the cone geometry, in order to better understand protein-ligand interactions. The glycosylated compounds were studied with Ralstonia solanacearum lectin, in order to better understand the nature of the carbohydrate‐lectin interactions in solution. The series of cationic calixarene was employed with three different acidic proteins: GB 1, Fld and alpha synuclein. Particularly GB 1 and Fld were observed to interact with all five cationic calix[4]arenes but showing different behaviours and affinities...|$|E

It was {{shown that the}} non-conserved epitopes map to the N-terminal half of E 1 by analysis of chimeric E 1 proteins of strains Brescia and C. Conserved epitopes, however, could not be mapped using this approach. Here we describe mapping of both conserved and non-conserved epitopes on E 1 {{by the use of}} an extensive set of single and double deletion mutants of E 1 of strain Brescia. Deletion mutants were transiently expressed in COS 1 cells and analysed by immunostaining with the 13 MAbs directed against strain Brescia and four MAbs directed against strain C. All MAbs bound to the N-terminal half of El, i. e. amino acids 690 to 866 encoded by the sequence of strain Brescia. Domain B and one epitope in domain C are located between residues 690 and 773. Other epitopes in domain C are located on an extended region, i. e. between residues 690 and 800. Conserved epitopes of domain A are mapped between residues 766 and 866, whereas the only non-conserved epitope in this domain is located between residues 766 and 813. Domain D, represented by one MAb, is located in the same region as this nonconserved epitope of domain A, i. e. between residues 766 and 800. The results suggest the presence of two distinct <b>antigenic</b> <b>units</b> on El, one consisting of domains B and C and the other consisting of domain A...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Glycoprotein E 2, the immunodominant protein of {{classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV), can induce neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity in pigs. Our previous phylogenetic analysis showed that subgroup 2. 1 viruses branched away from subgroup 1. 1, the vaccine C-strain lineage, and became dominant in China. The E 2 glycoproteins of CSFV C-strain and recent subgroup 2. 1 field isolates are genetically different. However, {{it has not been}} clearly demonstrated how this diversity affects antigenicity of the protein. Results Antigenic variation of glycoprotein E 2 was observed not only between CSFV vaccine C-strain and subgroup 2. 1 strains, but also among strains of the same subgroup 2. 1 as determined by ELISA-based binding assay using pig antisera to the C-strain and a representative subgroup 2. 1 strain QZ- 07 currently circulating in China. Antigenic incompatibility of E 2 proteins markedly reduced neutralization efficiency against heterologous strains. Single amino acid substitutions of D 705 N, L 709 P, G 713 E, N 723 S, and S 779 A on C-strain recombinant E 2 (rE 2) proteins significantly increased heterologous binding to anti-QZ- 07 serum, suggesting that these residues may be responsible for the antigenic variation between the C-strain and subgroup 2. 1 strains. Notably, a G 713 E substitution caused the most dramatic enhancement of binding of the variant C-strain rE 2 protein to anti-QZ- 07 serum. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the glutamic acid residue at this position is conserved within group 2 strains, while the glycine residue is invariant among the vaccine strains, highlighting the role of the residue at this position as a major determinant of antigenic variation of E 2. A variant Simpson's index analysis showed that both codons and amino acids of the residues contributing to antigenic variation have undergone similar diversification. Conclusions These results demonstrate that CSFV vaccine C-strain and group 2 strains circulating in China differ in the antigenicity of their E 2 glycoproteins. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>units</b> has revealed residues that limit cross-reactivity. Our findings may be useful for the development of serological differential assays and improvement of immunogenicity of novel {{classical swine fever}} vaccines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Multiple genetically and antigenically {{distinct}} hemagglutinin {{genes of}} the H 1 and H 3 influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes co-circulate in North American swine. This diversity has evolved by repeated transmission of IAVs from humans to swine and subsequent antigenic drift in swine. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of these diverse HA lineages in North American swine, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of 1576 H 1 and 607 H 3 HA gene segments, {{as well as}} 834 N 1 and 1293 N 2 NA gene segments, and 2126 M gene segments. These data revealed yearly co-circulation of H 1 N 1, H 1 N 2, and H 3 N 2 viruses, with three HA clades representing {{the majority of the}} HA sequences: of the H 1 viruses, 42 % were classified as H 1 δ 1 and 40. 6 % were classified as H 1 γ; and of the H 3 viruses 53 % were classified as cluster IV-A H 3 N 2. We detected a genetically distinct minor clade consisting of 37 H 1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013, which we classified as H 1 γ - 2. We estimated that this clade circulated in swine since approximately 1995, but it was not detected in swine until 2003. Though this clade only represents 1. 07 % of swine H 1 sequences reported over the past 10 years, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays demonstrated that representatives of this clade of viruses are antigenically distinct, and, when measured using antigenic cartography, were as many as 7 <b>antigenic</b> <b>units</b> from other H 1 γ viruses. Therefore vaccines against the contemporary H 1 γ viruses are not likely to cross-protect against γ - 2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these γ - 2 viruses suggests that minor populations of viruses may be underreported in the national dataset given the long branch lengths and gaps in detections. The identification of these γ - 2 viruses demonstrates the need for robust surveillance to capture the full diversity IAVs in swine in the USA and the importance of antigenic drift in the diversification and emergence of new antigenic variants in swine, which complicates vaccine design...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} {{immunodiffusion}} and immunoelectrophoresis {{study has been}} made of antigenic relationships of Bence Jones proteins, and the three classes of normal and pathological immunoglobulins, 7 S γ, β 2 A, and β 2 M. All thirty-nine Bence Jones proteins studied could be classified into either one of two distinct antigenic types, A or B. Both types are related to the immunoelectrophoretically slow (S) fragment of a papain digest of normal γ-globulin; B is related more closely than A, but neither has antigenic determinants in common with the fast (F) fragment. The 7 S γ myeloma globulins were either immunological type I or II. The papain digests of these proteins produced the S and F precipitin lines in immunoelectrophoresis but multiple bands in starch gel electrophoresis, especially in the F region. The S fraction of type I myeloma globulins is antigenically similar to Bence Jones protein of type B, and the S component of type II myeloma globulins has antigenic determinants in common with type A Bence Jones protein. Correspondingly, myeloma patients with type I globulins and proteinuria usually excrete type B Bence Jones proteins, whereas patients with type II excrete type A proteins. The F fragment is the part common to normal 7 S γ-globulin and types I and II myeloma globulins but is absent in β 2 A and β 2 M pathological globulins and in both types of Bence Jones proteins. Papain digests of β 2 A myeloma globulins produced a single precipitin line in immunoelectrophoresis. β 2 A myeloma globulins appeared to have two <b>antigenic</b> <b>units,</b> one in common with type B Bence Jones protein and normal γ-globulin, and another specific to β 2 A. The β 2 A myeloma patients excreted type B Bence Jones protein. The papain digest of a macroglobulin produced two precipitin lines, the faster of which had antigenic determinants in common with type B Bence Jones protein, the slower seemed specific for the macroglobulin. Five serum micromolecular globulins proved to be either type A or B Bence Jones proteins. From the above results, an antigenic map was constructed showing which determinants are shared and which are specific for normal 7 S γ-globulin, types I and II myeloma globulins, β 2 A myeloma globulins, a macroglobulin, and types A and B Bence Jones proteins...|$|R
40|$|Active Eastern or Western equine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus in three forms,—chemically untreated but simply passaged through series of mice; adsorbed on alumina Gel C, and precipitated by tannin,—yielded practically {{the same results}} when employed for the immunization of guinea pigs. The virus is not inactivated {{by the process of}} adsorption or precipitation : guinea pigs and mice inoculated in the brain with these materials develop lethal encephalomyelitis {{in the same manner as}} when chemically untreated mouse passage virus has been used. Moreover, there is no difference in the rate of absorption in vivoof the chemically treated and untreated virus preparations. After storage of the three immunizing preparations—the longest periods thus far studied being 2 to 3 months for mouse passage and for precipitated suspensions, and 6 months for adsorbed material—each was found to contain an amount of virus sufficient to produce immunity in animals against the usual intracerebral test inoculation. Finally, the protection afforded by the three preparations is apparently durable, as is true of many active viruses utilized in preventive treatments. The amount of the virus necessary to confer protection may be defined as that which immunizes (a) with the least number of <b>antigenic</b> <b>units</b> and (b) with the minimum of febrile reaction and blood infection. In proportion as this amount is exceeded, the incidence of fever and of circulating virus increases and, on the other hand, as this amount is decreased, the degree of induced immunity is diminished. We have thus shown that for this particular virus and in the guinea pig, one or two subcutaneous doses of I cc. of any of the different virus preparations, each containing 3 x 103 to 3 x 104 mouse infective units, bring about protection regularly against experimental infection by way of the nose or subcutis. The results are irregular when the test is made by way of the brain. By three injections, resistance is invariably obtained against as many as 103 to 104 lethal doses, given intracerebrally. No matter in what form the virus is given, as mouse passage, or adsorbed, or precipitated material, in certain instances fever occurs and virus circulates. With the amount of virus adequate for immunization (3, 000 to 30, 000 m. i. u.) a mild or subclinical infection may occur in the guinea pig without other manifestation of disease. Lesser quantities of virus apparently fail to gain a foothold in the animal and thus fail to bring about resistance. To conclude, a quantitative basis has been established for the comparison of the immunizing capacities of preparations employed in experimental {{equine encephalomyelitis}} in guinea pigs...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A virus (IAV) is a {{significant}} threat to profitability in the swine industry. Although vaccines can prevent the damage and spread of the pathogen, changes in the antigenic properties of the virus due to evolution may cause the virus to escape the immune response. Identifying key amino acids on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that significantly contribute to antigenicity is important for understanding how IAV adapts in response to immune pressures so more effective vaccines can be developed. In this study we took antigenic distance data obtained by hemagglutination inhibition assays from 30 H 1 subtype influenza virus strains and combined it with amino acid sequence data from the HA of the same isolates. We plotted these two variables against each other to obtain linear relationships between antigenic and genetic similarity of the viruses. We then compared amino acid differences between outlier comparisons using a threshold of two <b>antigenic</b> distance <b>units</b> above the linear fit and determined the most represented positions among all outliers. We found six amino acid positions on the HA had changes that were associated with over 50 % of the outlier comparisons.

In a tenth patient's liver, much higher activity was found (0. 5 % of normal). In this patient the residual enzyme had the same molecular weight as beta-galactosidase A, the major form of beta-galactosidase of normal human liver. No activity was found that corresponded to beta-galactosidase B, the minor form of human liver beta-galactosidase.

40|$|AbstractVaccination is {{at present}} the most {{efficient}} way of preventing influenza infections. Currently used inactivated influenza vaccines can induce virus-neutralizing antibodies that are protective against a particular influenza strain, but hamper the induction of cross-protective T-cell responses to later infections. Thus, influenza vaccines need to be updated annually in order to confer protection against circulating influenza strains. This study aims at developing an efficient vaccine that can induce broader protection against influenza. For this purpose, we have used the highly conserved nucleoprotein (NP) from an influenza A virus subtype H 7 N 7 strain, and inserted it into a vaccine format that targets an antigen directly to relevant antigen presenting cells (APCs). The vaccine format consists of bivalent <b>antigenic</b> and targeting <b>units,</b> linked via an Ig-based dimerization unit. In this study, NP was linked to MIP- 1 α, a chemokine that targets the linked antigen to chemokine receptors 1, 3 and 5 expressed on various APCs. The vaccine protein was indirectly delivered by DNA. Mice were vaccinated intradermally with plasmids, in combination with electroporation to enhance cellular uptake of DNA. We found that a single DNA vaccination was sufficient for induction of both antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice. Targeting of nucleoprotein to chemokine receptors enhanced T cell responses but not antibody responses. Moreover, a single dose of MIP 1 α-NP conferred protection in BALB/c mice against a lethal challenge with an H 1 N 1 influenza virus. The observed cross-protection was mediated by CD 8 + T cells...|$|R
