5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, MacPherson, Hamister and Lauchlin M. Currie {{developed}} thermal purification techniques for the large scale production of low boron content graphite. The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite ("Acheson Graphite Ordinary Temperature") by National Carbon. With a neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> section of 4.97 mbarns, the AGOT graphite is considered as the first true nuclear-grade graphite. By November 1942 National Carbon had shipped 255 tons of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago, where it became {{the primary source of}} graphite {{to be used in the}} construction of Chicago Pile-1.|$|E

25|$|Cladding is {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} fuel rods, {{standing}} between the coolant and the nuclear fuel. It is made of a corrosion-resistant material with low <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> section for thermal neutrons, usually Zircaloy or steel in modern constructions, or magnesium with small amount of aluminium and other metals for the now-obsolete Magnox reactors. Cladding prevents radioactive fission fragments from escaping the fuel into the coolant and contaminating it.|$|E
25|$|Deuterium's <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> {{section for}} thermal {{neutrons}} is 0.52 millibarns (5.2 × 10−32 m2; 1 barn = 10−28 m2), while those of oxygen-16 and oxygen-17 are 0.19 and 0.24 millibarns, respectively. 17O makes up 0.038% of natural oxygen, making the overall cross section 0.28 millibarns. Therefore, in D2O with natural oxygen, 21% of neutron captures are on oxygen, rising higher as 17O builds up from neutron capture on 16O. Also, 17O may emit an alpha particle on neutron capture, producing radioactive carbon-14.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{and then}} {{machining}} plutonium is difficult {{not only because}} of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30-35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range. When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.|$|E
40|$|All-inorganic {{colloidal}} perovskite {{quantum dots}} (QDs) based on cesium, lead, and halide have recently emerged as promising light emitting materials. CsPbBr 3 QDs {{have also been}} demonstrated as stable two-photon-pumped lasing medium. However, the reported two photon <b>absorption</b> (TPA) <b>cross</b> sections for these QDs differ by an order of magnitude. Here we present an in-depth study of the TPA properties of CsPbBr 3 QDs with mean size ranging from 4. 6 to 11. 4 nm. By using femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy we found that TPA cross section {{is proportional to the}} linear one photon <b>absorption.</b> The TPA <b>cross</b> section follows a power law dependence on QDs size with exponent 3. 3 +/- 0. 2. The empirically obtained power-law dependence suggests that the TPA process through a virtual state populates exciton band states. The revealed power-law dependence and the understanding of TPA process are important for developing high performance nonlinear optical devices based on CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals...|$|R

500|$|Instead, Goeppert became {{interested}} in physics, and chose to pursue a Ph.D. In her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. Eugene Wigner later described the thesis as [...] "a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness". At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but {{the development of the}} laser permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a europium-doped crystal.:Eu2+ |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=229–232 |year=1961 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.229|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...7..229K }} To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> section is named the Goeppert-Mayer (GM) unit. One GM is 10−50 cm4 s photon−1. Her examiners were three Nobel prize winners: Max Born, James Franck and Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus (in 1954, 1925, and 1928, respectively).|$|E
500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a heat {{transfer}} fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another {{heat transfer}} application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.|$|E

2500|$|After enrichment, {{the uranium}} dioxide (...) powder is fired in a high-temperature, {{sintering}} furnace to create hard, ceramic pellets of enriched uranium dioxide.

40|$|Improved Wallachian is {{a typical}} sheep breed in the Czech Republic and, at present, this breed ac-counts for {{approximately}} 4 % of the domestic sheep population (Holá, 2004). Improved Wallachian is generally a triple-purpose breed producing meat, milk and wool. In the Czech Republic this breed is reared above all for production of lambs and {{there are only a}} few farms where the ewes of this breed are milked. However, production of lambs is an important source of income also on these farms and the revenues from the sale of this com-modity amount to approximately 25 – 35 % of total incomes. Improved Wallachian (IW) sheep are very resistant to unfavourable climatic conditions and for that reason they are very suitable for rais-ing in submontane and mountain regions.
