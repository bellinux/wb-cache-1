50|$|The {{transmission}} was a Hewland FT2000, providing five {{speeds and}} reverse, {{and it had}} an alloy <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate.</b> The hydraulic clutch system was complete, {{up to and including}} the release mechanism on the gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|There are 2 models {{by special}} order. The SP-RE [...] "Sport Prototype Rotary Engine" [...] with a Mazda RX-7 engine, using a Porsche G50 {{transaxle}} {{coupled with a}} KEP <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate.</b> The other model is the DDR SP-BE [...] "DDR Sport Prototype Boxer Engine" [...] using a Subaru engine and transaxle.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "SO Series" [...] {{is a model}} {{intended}} for service pistol competitions. It comes in two variants where the difference is the frame material. The SO has a steel frame, while the AL SO SAO has an aluminium frame. Both versions feature fixed sights (on an <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate),</b> a non-adjustable SAO trigger, short magazine catch and polymer grip plates.|$|E
50|$|The in-line six Bristol engine {{fitted to}} the Aceca-Bristol {{was based on}} a design from BMW with cast iron block and {{aluminium}} cylinder head. It has a single camshaft with pushrods running vertically to a rocker shaft on the inlet side of the engine and further horizontal pushrods running in 6 tubes {{over the top of the}} engine in order to reach the exhaust rockers. The two inclined rocker covers give the engine a similar appearance to an overhead - camshaft arrangement. Three inline Solex downdraft carburettors were bolted directly to the cylinder head casting using small <b>adaptor</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|A third {{method of}} {{thermoplastic}} welding is called sidewall fusion, or saddle fusion. Sidewall fusion is, like butt fusion and socket fusion, another process based on hot plate welding. Sidewall fusion differs from either socket, or butt fusion methods by performing fusion {{into the side}} of the pipe wall in a transverse orientation to the main pipe, rather than in line with the pipe. Sidewall fusion is typically employed in conjunction with either socket or butt fusion methods as a complementary process and many fusion machines designed for butt fusion are also equipped for sidewall fusion. <b>Adaptor</b> <b>plates</b> that match the outside diameter of the main pipe are applied to the heating plate to perform this type of fusion.|$|R
40|$|A micro-plate {{magnetic}} chemiluminescence immunoassay {{was developed}} for rapid and high throughput detection of carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) in human sera. This method {{was based on a}} sandwich immunoreaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled anti-CEA antibodies, CEA antigens, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-CEA antibodies in micro-plate. The immunomagnetic particles coated with anti-FITC antibodies were used as the solid phase for the immunoassay. The separation procedure was carried out by a magnetic <b>plate</b> <b>adaptor</b> and the luminol-hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) -HRP system was employed for the chemiluminescence detection. The proposed method combined the advantages of the micro-plate reactor and magnetic particle separation technology with the linear range of 5 - 250 ng mL(- 1). The detection limit of CEA was 0. 61 ng mL(- 1). The coefficient of the variation was less than 7 % and 13 % for intra-assay and inter-assay precision, respectively. Compared with the commercial micro-plate chemiluminescent kit, the proposed method showed a good correlation...|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{production}} a new model called the [...] "5R" [...] was introduced. The design of this engine was quite different from earlier models, using a conventional gearbox from a Yamaha 4HP outboard attached via an <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate</b> to a QB engine. These models were painted blue, the very last examples (known as [...] "gold tops") having propellers and recoil starters that were gold-painted.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Global Positioning em antenna adaptor allows fixed {{antenna height}} measurements by removably attaching an <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate</b> to a conventional surveyor's tripod. Antenna height {{is controlled by}} an antenna boom which is a fixed length rod. The antenna is attached to {{one end of the}} boom. The opposite end of the boom tapers to a point sized to fit into a depression at the center of survey markers. The boom passes through the hollow center of a universal ball joint which is mounted {{at the center of the}} <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate</b> so that the point of the rod can be fixed in the marker's central depression. The mountains of the ball joint allow the joint to be moved horizontally in any direction relative to the tripod. When the ball joint is moved horizontally, the angle between the boom and the vertical changes because the boom's position is fixed at its lower end. A spirit level attached to the rod allows an operator to determine when the boom is plumb. The position of the ball joint is adjusted horizontally until the boom is plumb. At that time the antenna is positioned exactly over the center of the monument and the elevation of the antenna is precisely set by the length of the boom...|$|E
30|$|The prism-coupled {{condenser}} design enjoys {{three major}} advantages for super-resolution imaging. First, the de-coupling between the imaging and condenser objective and {{increase of the}} angle between them from 90 to roughly 120 degrees relaxes the space constraint for sample placement. The design widens the choice of imaging objectives and allows the use of even higher NA (NA > 1.0) water-immersion lenses. Second, the horizontal overlap between light-sheet illumination and the imaging plane yields a flat and large FOV with high SNR. Large FOV is {{necessary in order to}} capture the entire cross-section of the nucleus of the hESC. Third, compared to the AFM cantilever system (Gebhardt et al. 2013), the prism design is less prone to vibrations and simpler to implement in biology labs. In addition, the design is directly compatible with cell culture by accepting standard petri dishes. In our setup, we used a 35 -mm glass-bottom petri dish (MatTek P 35 G- 0 - 20 -C) as the sample holder. For sample placement, we custom made an aluminum <b>adaptor</b> <b>plate</b> clamped onto a piezo translation stage (Thorlabs NanoMax-TS) and tilted at a horizontal angle of approximately 20 degrees (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The adaptor held the glass bottom dish flush with the top surface of the prism with index-matching oil in between. The piezo stage (Thorlabs NanoMax-TS) translated the sample along the top surface of the prism and exposed different depths of the hESC to light-sheet illumination. The excitation lasers, a 150 -mW 561 -nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (Cobolt Jive) and a 160 -mW 642 -nm diode laser (Coherent Cube), were brought together before the cylindrical lens and the condenser lens. Sharing the illumination path was a 60 mW 405 nm (Omicron PhoxX) laser for activation. For fluorescence imaging, an emission filter (600 / 60 for mEos and 705 / 130 for Alexa 647) and a notch filter were placed in front of an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon DU- 897 E with a pixel size of 16 × 16 μm). For imaging fixed cells, we used a custom mounting for the camera with a 300 -mm tube lens, bringing the effective magnification to 115 × (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2 a). For live cell imaging, we adapted the light sheet system to the framework of a Zeiss Examiner.D 1 upright microscope with mechanical support (not shown).|$|E
