5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle <b>attachment</b> <b>point.</b> He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

25|$|A {{wastegate}} {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted, generally vacuum hose <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s electronic control unit or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open, thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate.|$|E
30|$|Ad hoc {{networking}} in {{a heterogeneous}} setting can be advantageous when vehicles {{are not covered}} by any <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> or in the case where desirable access networks are available but are out of range. Eventhough only a few papers in the literature have studied the possibility of ad hoc networking in a heterogeneous environment [3], these articles employ ad hoc networking only as a means for forwarding data to the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> that are pre-selected. In our topology we consider ad hoc communications as an independent connectivity alternative which enables us to take the appropriateness of both the possible multi-hop routes and the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> into account as opposed to only the <b>attachment</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

It carried the powertrain, front suspension and floorpan, allowing greater isolation of road and engine harshness (the design was conceptually similar to the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird that would debut for 1967).|$|E
25|$|Bones serve {{a variety}} of {{mechanical}} functions. Together the bones in the body form the skeleton. They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> for skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics).|$|E
25|$|The AAIB {{also studied}} the {{crashworthiness}} {{of the aircraft}} during the accident sequence. It observed that the main <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> for the main landing gear (MLG) was the rear spar of the aircraft's wing; because this spar also formed the rear wall of the main fuel tanks, the crash landing caused the tanks to rupture. It was recommended that Boeing redesign the landing gear attachment to {{reduce the likelihood of}} fuel loss in similar circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The hindlimbs {{were large}} and robust to {{accommodate}} {{the weight of the}} body and strong enough to allow a bipedal walk. The femur was slightly longer than the tibia. This may indicate that the legs were used as pillars, and not for sprinting. Taquet concluded that Ouranosaurus was not a good runner because the fourth trochanter, the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> for the large retractor muscles connected to the tail base, was weakly developed. The foot was narrow with only three toes and relatively long.|$|E
25|$|Catherine Forster {{argued that}} there was no {{satisfactory}} evidence for sexual dimorphism in ceratopsids. She also joined the growing consensus that Triceratops should be classified among the long-frilled ceratopsids. Forster performed a cladistic analysis of the ceratopsids. She argued against the idea that ceratopsid frills served as attachment sites for large jaw muscles. She observed that the opening in the skull above the animal's temple seems to show the physical location extent of the jaw muscle <b>attachment</b> <b>point.</b> She supported the hypothesis that ceratopsids used their horns and frills in competition over mates.|$|E
