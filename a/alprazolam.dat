5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> {{is taken}} orally, and is absorbed well – 80% of <b>alprazolam</b> binds to {{proteins}} in the serum (the majority binding to albumin). The concentration of <b>alprazolam</b> peaks after {{one to two}} hours.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of <b>alprazolam</b> has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). <b>Alprazolam</b> is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of <b>alprazolam</b> being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, <b>alprazolam,</b> in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} <b>alprazolam.</b> Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of <b>alprazolam</b> is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of <b>alprazolam</b> developed reversible depression. In the US, <b>alprazolam</b> is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, <b>alprazolam</b> is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Imipramine and {{desipramine}} {{have been}} reported increase an average of 31% and 20% respectively by the concomitant administration of <b>alprazolam</b> tablets. Combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of <b>alprazolam,</b> which may lead to increased plasma levels of <b>alprazolam</b> and accumulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, <b>alprazolam</b> produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of <b>alprazolam</b> on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. <b>Alprazolam</b> and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. <b>Alprazolam</b> causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of <b>alprazolam</b> are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. <b>Alprazolam</b> is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of <b>alprazolam</b> in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of <b>alprazolam.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> {{is mostly}} {{used to treat}} anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and nausea due to chemotherapy. <b>Alprazolam</b> may also be {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder, {{as well as for the}} treatment of anxiety conditions with co-morbid depression. The FDA label advises that the physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of <b>alprazolam,</b> which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> may be {{quantified}} in blood or plasma to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma <b>alprazolam</b> concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with <b>alprazolam,</b> but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> regular {{release and}} orally {{disintegrating}} tablets are available as 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2mg tablets, while extended release tablets are available as 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 3mg. <b>Alprazolam</b> oral solutions are available as 0.5mg/5 mL and as 1mg/1 mL oral solutions. Inactive ingredients in <b>alprazolam</b> tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, povidone, sodium starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25mg tablet contains D Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5mg tablet contains FD Yellow No. 6 and D Yellow No. 10.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam,</b> {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. <b>Alprazolam,</b> like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. <b>Alprazolam</b> is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Coma {{and death}} if <b>alprazolam</b> is {{combined}} with other substances.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Romach {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} that dose escalation {{is not a}} characteristic of long-term <b>alprazolam</b> users, and {{that the majority of}} long-term <b>alprazolam</b> users change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, <b>alprazolam</b> is a Schedule 4 medicine.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>alprazolam</b> is FDA-approved for the {{treatment}} of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. <b>Alprazolam</b> is recommended by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder where there is no history of tolerance or dependence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> {{is covered}} under , which was filed on 29 October 1969, granted on 19 October 1976, and expired in September 1993.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with other medications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, <b>alprazolam</b> is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of <b>alprazolam.</b> Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. <b>Alprazolam</b> is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
5|$|Elderly {{individuals}} {{should be}} cautious {{in the use}} of <b>alprazolam</b> due to the possibility of increased susceptibility to side-effects, especially loss of coordination and drowsiness.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, <b>alprazolam</b> is a {{prescription}} drug in List IV (Schedule 4) under the Narcotics Drugs Act (1968).|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, <b>alprazolam</b> is a List 2 {{substance}} of the Opium Law and is available for prescription.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>alprazolam</b> is a {{prescription}} drug and is assigned to Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, <b>alprazolam</b> is {{included}} under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances as Schedule IV.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of <b>alprazolam</b> can be mild {{to severe}} {{depending}} on how much of it taken and other drugs that have been taken.|$|E
5|$|Some common {{symptoms}} of <b>alprazolam</b> discontinuation include malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness.|$|E
5|$|The metabolites, {{as well as}} some unmetabolized <b>alprazolam,</b> are {{filtered}} out by the kidneys and are excreted in the urine.|$|E
5|$|A 1990 study {{claimed that}} {{diazepam}} {{has a higher}} misuse potential relative to other benzodiazepines, and that some data suggests that <b>alprazolam</b> and lorazepam resemble diazepam in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Administration of <b>alprazolam,</b> as {{compared}} to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alprazolam</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that <b>alprazolam</b> is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2013, in {{anticipation}} of the rescheduling of <b>alprazolam</b> to Schedule 8 in Australia—Pfizer Australia announced they would be discontinuing the Xanax brand in Australia as it is no longer commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of <b>alprazolam</b> should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to <b>alprazolam</b> or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|In Australia, <b>alprazolam</b> was {{originally}} a Schedule 4 (Prescription Only) medication; however, as of February 2014, {{it has become}} a Schedule 8 medication, subjecting it to more rigorous prescribing requirements.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, <b>alprazolam</b> can be {{prescribed}} normally in doses up to 1mg. Higher doses are scheduled as Anlage III drugs and require a special prescription form.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{central nervous}} system depressants, <b>alprazolam</b> in larger-than-normal doses can cause {{significant}} deterioration in alertness and increase drowsiness, especially in those unaccustomed to the drug's effects.|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than <b>alprazolam</b> (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of <b>alprazolam</b> include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
