In 2000, BMC had reportedly invested {{with a firm}} called Interliant, a Purchase, New York provider. which [...] "rented software to corporations over the Internet." [...] The reporter explained: [...] "By using an A.S.P. (<b>application</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider),</b> a business {{does not have to}} buy the programs itself, store them on servers and hard drives, or maintain and upgrade them.

2500|$|Poor speech {{habits and}} other {{problems}} such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can [...] "flag" [...] such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of [...] "learned" [...] language. The result is often a [...] "word salad" [...] or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the word salad passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and [...] "edits" [...] the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word [...] "not" [...] is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a server-based program from a vendor <b>Application</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Provider</b> (ASP).|$|E
