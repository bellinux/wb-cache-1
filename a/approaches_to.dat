40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a {{distinction}} is made between Turing’s <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> computability, {{on the one}} hand, and his <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> mathematical reasoning and intelligence, on the other hand. Unlike Church’s <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> computability, which is top-down being based on the axiomatic method, Turing’s <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> computability is bottom-up, being based on {{an analysis of the}} actions of a human computer. It is argued that, for this reason, Turing’s <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> computability is convincing. On the other hand, his <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> mathematical reasoning and intelligence is not equally convincing, because {{it is based on the}} assumption that intelligent processes are basically mechanical processes, which however from time to time may require some decision by an external operator, based on intuition. This contrasts with the fact that intelligent processes can be better accounted for in rational terms, specifically, in terms of non-deductive inferences, rather than in term of inscrutable intuition...|$|R
