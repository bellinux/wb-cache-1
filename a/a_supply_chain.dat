25|$|In the 1840s, the Manchester Corporation Water Works {{recommended}} {{that to the}} city corporation that an infrastructure to increase water supplies to cope with demand must be built. The obvious choice for this supply would come from areas of high rainfall and there were three choices which were close enough to Manchester. The Lake District, Peak District and Snowdonia are traditionally rainy areas with its numerous valleys, ideal for a large reservoir. This was rejected in favour of John Frederick Bateman's proposal to build <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> of six reservoirs in the Longdendale Valley {{to the east of}} Manchester.|$|E
25|$|Corporations {{manage their}} supply chain to take {{advantage}} of cheaper costs of production. <b>A</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large orders placed by multinational corporations.|$|E

While No. 1 TAF was intended to operate as a highly mobile striking force, by mid-1945 these operations had left it operating a string of bases outside of the main combat zones. These bases required air garrisons to protect them from remnant Japanese forces, as well as administrative units to maintain <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> back to Australia.|$|E

25|$|The systems {{described}} above are ideal types: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories. Consider, for example, that {{the production of}} jeans involves initially carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving, then cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets by combining the fabric with thread, zippers and buttons, finally finishing and distressing the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores. The beginning {{can be seen as}} process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will keep all the stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of vertical integration and outsourcing arises. Most products require, from <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> perspective, both process production and part production.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the more}} {{practical}} perspective netchain {{is used instead}} of [...] "chain and network". The simplest situation is for companies to form <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> or network {{in which they are}} selling product to each other. The phrase netchain captures two main aspects of collaborations. Chain reflects the hard aspect, where products and money is flowing (chain) and network reflects the soft aspect, the network of people having informal relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Retailing {{involves}} {{the process of}} selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through <b>a</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. The term [...] "retailer" [...] is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders {{of a large number}} of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping (just looking, not buying) and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.|$|E
40|$|For many years, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> {{research}} {{focused on}} operational aspects and therefore {{mainly on the}} optimisation of parts of the production and distribution processes. Recently, {{there has been an}} increasing interest in <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management and collaboration between <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> partners. However, there is no model that takes into consideration all aspects required to adequately represent and measure the performance of <b>a</b> collaborative <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> This thesis proposes a model of <b>a</b> collaborative <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> consisting of six constituents, all of which are required in order to provide a complete picture of such <b>a</b> collaborative <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> In conjunction with that, <b>a</b> collaborative <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> performance indicator is developed.
