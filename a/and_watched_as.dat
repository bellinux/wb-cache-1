5|$|Edge {{returned}} on the September 9, 2013, {{episode of}} Raw {{in his hometown}} of Toronto where he hosted his talk show The Cutting Edge having Daniel Bryan as his special guest after Randy Orton was scheduled to be his original guest. Edge insulted Triple H in the segment, who retaliated by labeling Edge's main event push as a complete failure and sending The Shield to attack Edge's friend Christian. When Edge went to confront Triple H, he was escorted from the building. Edge hosted The Cutting Edge on the September 13 episode of SmackDown, where he mocked Randy Orton <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Orton's attack on Bryan backfired.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} World Tag Team Championship signalled {{the end of the}} team; in the {{following}} weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by The Hurricane's injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, The Hurricane did not show up in a World Tag Team title match leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, now going by his real name, Gregory Helms, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Näslund {{subsequently}} {{joined the}} Penguins for the 1993–94 season. Due to teammate Bryan Trottier already wearing his Modo jersey number, 19, he chose number 29 instead. He {{appeared in his}} first NHL game on 5 October 1993 against the Philadelphia Flyers. Five days later, he registered his first NHL point, an assist, during {{a game against the}} Quebec Nordiques. His first NHL goal came the following month on 9 November 1993 in a 3–3 tie against the St. Louis Blues. The goal came in the first period on the powerplay against goaltender Curtis Joseph, assisted by Doug Brown and Marty McSorley. Upon entering the NHL, Näslund struggled and was admittedly frustrated with himself. As a result, he was demoted to the Penguins' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks, on several occasions. He finished his rookie campaign with four goals and seven assists in 71games. Although the Penguins qualified for the 1994 playoffs, Näslund did not participate in post-season play, being made a healthy scratch (non-dressing player), <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Washington eliminated Pittsburgh in the first round.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

This time was different. Xwechtáal had noticed that his first wife, from before he left on his journey, had remarried. He also realized he was not gone four days like he expected, but 10 years had passed. Instead of reviving the entire village, he left his ex-wife and her husband dead.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Gravelle {{was cast}} as Joe Miller, DS Miller's husband. Gravelle auditioned {{along with many}} other actors for the role, but Chibnall says that the casting team early on {{considered}} Gravelle their top choice for the role. The producers knew that this was a critical casting decision. Whoever they hired to play Joe Miller would need to step up their acting game significantly in the final episode, so they researched Gravelle's past acting roles <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> many of his performances as they could find. Chibnall paid particularly close attention to the Welsh language television series Teulu, in which Gravelle had recently played a lead role.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles was by {{now well}} aware of Napoleon's {{intentions}} but remained committed to his plan not to fight the battle on the flat Marchfeld plain, where the superior French cavalry would have given Napoleon a clear edge. Thus, Charles did nothing to support his two forward units <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Nordmann gradually withdrew north, towards the Russbach line and Klenau withdrew northwest, towards Breintlee. Meanwhile, Napoleon was free to advance north, into the Marchfeld plain, where he would have enough room to deploy his forces. The French advanced in battalion columns, with their front line formed by the Corps of Masséna on the left, Oudinot in the centre and Davout on the right, and the respective Corps cavalry screening the flanks. By noon, the French had advanced into the Marchfeld, a move which so far suited both commanders.|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} of bodies was slow. Spanish law required that, {{in order to}} avoid the spread of disease, bodies be buried within 24 hours and remain buried for at least five years. Three bodies were caught in the wreckage at the surface. But no one noticed them until February 23 (a full week after the explosion), and by then vultures had devoured much of the corpses. Although only 19 corpses had been found, the city of Havana held a funeral for the dead. Thousands of people turned out for the funeral cortege <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> the Spanish military bore the 19 elaborate coffins with great ceremony through the streets to Colon Cemetery, Havana. Another 135 bodies were recovered on February 19. The New York Times reported that this included the limbs of about 10 men. Twenty-four of them were identifiable. Two of the eight wounded (including Coxswain Alfred J. Holland) died that day as well.|$|E

25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, the Bulldogs went on {{the road}} to play Portland, whom they beat 71–49. Despite two early fouls on Olynyk in the first half, Gonzaga shot 46.6% from the field. Olynyk would come back with a strong second half to finish with 21 points, eight rebounds, one steal, and two blocks. The game {{extended}} Gonzaga's best start in school history with an eight-game winning streak. Two days later, they would travel to Hinkle Fieldhouse to play a non-conference game at #13 Butler {{as a part of the}} debut game of ESPN's College GameDay for the 2013 college basketball season. Gonzaga was ahead 33–32 at halftime, but Butler scored the first five points of the second half to take the lead. Ahead 63–62 with 3.5 seconds left, Stockton threw the ball inbounds <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> it was stolen by Butler sophomore Roosevelt Jones, who took the buzzer beater shot to give Butler the 64–63 win. The team would recover and return home from their second loss of the season on January 24 by beating BYU 83–63. Olynyk scored 26 points on 9-for-9 shooting and was also 8-for-8 on free throws. The Zags won the rebound battle 37–29 and outscored BYU 42–28 in the paint while shooting 56.9% from the field.|$|E

On 8 November the unit was moved to RAF Leuchars and then on 29 November back to No. 11 Group RAF in the south at RAF Tangmere near Chichester in West Sussex. The squadron remained idle for the winter as The Blitz and the German night attacks began and lasted in to the following spring. Finucane billeted near Oving. While drinking at a nearby pub overlooking the harbour an air raid struck Southampton. Finucane heard the drone of German bombers over the Isle of Wight in the distance <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> the pathfinders marked the city. They clambered into a Wolseley Hornet two-seater car and headed into the town to seek out acquaintances of a squadron-mate.

500|$|McKinley {{was assassinated}} in September 1901, and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt. [...] Taft and Roosevelt had first become friends around 1890 while Taft was Solicitor General and Roosevelt {{a member of the}} Civil Service Commission. Taft had, after McKinley's election, urged the {{appointment}} of Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Roosevelt became a war hero, Governor of New York, and Vice President of the United States. They met again when Taft went to Washington in January 1902 to recuperate after two operations caused by an infection. There, Taft testified before the Senate Committee on the Philippines. Taft wanted Filipino farmers to have a stake in the new government through land ownership, but much of the arable land was held by Catholic religious orders of mostly Spanish priests, which were often resented by the Filipinos. Roosevelt had Taft go to Rome to negotiate with Pope Leo XIII, to purchase the lands and to arrange the withdrawal of the Spanish priests, with Americans replacing them and training locals as clergy. Taft did not succeed in resolving these issues on his visit to Rome, but an agreement on both points was made in 1903.|$|E
500|$|The 'poor Woman', Mary Toft, was twenty-four or {{twenty-five years}} old. [...] She was baptised Mary Denyer on 21February 1703, the {{daughter}} of John and Jane Denyer. [...] In 1720 she married Joshua Toft, a journeyman clothier and together the couple had three children, Mary, Anne and James. [...] As an 18th-century English peasant, circumstances dictated that when in 1726 Toft again became pregnant, she continue working in the fields. [...] She complained of painful complications early in the pregnancy and in early August [...] several pieces of flesh, one [...] "as big as my arm". [...] This {{may have been the}} result of an abnormality of the developing placenta, which would have caused the embryo to stop developing and blood clots and flesh to be ejected. [...] Toft went into labour on 27September. [...] Her neighbour was called <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> she produced several animal parts.

After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord.

[...] By 1:44a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39a.m. Neighbors took to their roofs <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> American special forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, [...] "I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto {{to turn off the}} lights and stay inside." [...] Another man said he heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed. The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field. A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army. [...] "There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured", he said. [...] "There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound." [...] Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service, went out {{around the time of the}} raid and apparently included the military academy. Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout. One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout.|$|E
