5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes.

5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili {{says that}} the Security Council manifestly lacks the {{competence}} to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition {{of the use of}} force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.|$|E
25|$|Differing {{from most}} Australian Aboriginal communities, the {{fertility}} {{of their land}} allowed the Ngarrindjeri and Merkani to live a semi sedentary life, moving between permanent summer and winter camps. In fact, {{one of the major}} problems encountered by Europeans was the determination of the Ngarrindjeri to rebuild their camps on land claimed for grazing. Unlike the rest of Australia, the South Australia Act 1834 (Foundation Act) which enabled the province of South Australia to be established, acknowledged Aboriginal ownership and stated that no actions could be undertaken that would <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of any Aboriginal natives of the said province to the actual occupation and enjoyment in their own persons or in the persons of their descendants of any land therein now actually occupied or enjoyed by such natives. Effectively this guaranteed the land rights of Aboriginals under force of law but was interpreted by the colonists as simply meaning Aborigines could not be dispossessed of sites they permanently occupied. In May 1839, the protector of Aborigines William Wyatt announced publicly, it appeared that the natives occupy no lands in the especial manner described in the instructions. Bowing to the interests of prominent colonists and the Resident Commissioner who wanted to survey and sell the land without hindrance, Wyatt in his reports on Aboriginal culture and practices, never recorded that sites were permanently occupied.|$|E

500|$|The {{conditions}} for {{leave to appeal}} are laid out in Section 1(4). No conditions attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when {{the permission of the}} High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he [...] "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, or there was [...] "some special reason why such a notice was not given". In Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH, the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed [...] "Schedule of Further Reasons" [...] ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given. The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was [...] "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".|$|E
500|$|This {{has led to}} the {{development}} of the [...] "nature test". In R. v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin plc. (1986), In this case, the issue was whether a body discharging functions that are quasi-judicial in nature and which wields considerable de facto public powers is amenable to judicial review. The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers is an unincorporated association and does not derive its power directly from a legal source such as legislation. Rather, it is an informal body which has adopted a self-regulatory code to govern its members. However, Sir John Donaldson, the Master of the Rolls, observed that the Panel possesses [...] "immense power de facto by devising, promulgating, amending and interpreting the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers" [...] and its decisions could lead to sanctions which indirectly <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of citizens. Lord Justice Timothy Lloyd acknowledged that the source test is usually decisive, but disagreed that it is the sole test to determine whether a public body is subject to judicial review. He explained that it is instead helpful to look at the nature of the power– whether the body in question exercises public law functions or if the exercise of its functions has public law consequences.|$|E

2500|$|Ed Whelan, {{president}} of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center and a former lawyer in the George W.
