40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} non-classical <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz</b> is presented, {{which focuses on}} computational grid details for accurate simulations {{of this type of}} nonlinear transonic phenomenon. The analysis points out that mesh refinement is crucial to obtain reliable results and that the choice between a smoothed and non-smoothed geometry has an influence on the system response, both quantitatively and qualitatively. As a matter of fact, grid details affect the simulation of shock dynamics, which is the driving mechanism for non-classical <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{computational}} study of nonlinear effects of unsteady aerodynamics for non-classical <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz.</b> It aims at a comprehensive investigation of the <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz</b> phenomenon under varying flow parameters using the describing function technique with multiple inputs. The limit cycle oscillatory behavior of an asymmetrical airfoil is studied initially using a CFD-based numerical model and direct time marching. Sharp increases in limit cycle amplitude for varying Mach numbers and angles of attack are investigated. An aerodynamic describing function is developed in order to estimate the variation of limit cycle amplitude and frequency with Mach number and angle of attack directly, without time marching. The describing function results are compared to the amplitudes and frequencies predicted by the CFD calculations for validation purposes. Furthermore, a limited sensitivity analysis is presented to demonstrate {{the potential of the}} approach for aeroelastic design...|$|E
40|$|Three {{examples}} of advances in computational aerodynamics; (1) three-dimensional inviscid transonic analysis, (2) design calculations for wings, and (3) the computation of viscous-induced <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz,</b> are reviewed. Attention {{is given to}} wing surface pressures, design optimization, computer memory, speed and advanced solution methods on parallel computer architecture. It is determined that many implicit approximate-factorization schemes, {{that have been developed}} for Navier-Stokes equations, can be coded to run efficiently on microprocessors...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} inviscid, transonic <b>aileron</b> and trailing-edge <b>buzz</b> instabilities is presented. A mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation {{is used to}} model the fluid-structure system and to obtain a system of space-discretized equations that is time-marched to simulate the aeroelastic behavior of the wing-aileron system. Results obtained suggest that shock-induced separation {{may not be an}} essential driving force behind all buzz phenomena. Several examples are shown where the shock motion interacts with the aileron motion to extract energy from the flow. If the trailing-edge region is sufficiently flexible and the shocks are at the trailing edge, a trailing-edge buzz instability appears possible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{computational}} study of nonlinear effects of unsteady aerodynamics for non-classical <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz.</b> It aims at a comprehensive investigation of <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz</b> phenomenon under varying flow parameters utilizing the classical approach of describing function technique with multiple input variables. Limit cycle oscillatory behavior of an asymmetrical airfoil section has been studied initially using an expensive high-fidelity model basd on a coupled CFD/CSD time marching approach. Using this high fidelity model, a multiple input aerodynamic describing function was developed that can effectively represent lumped nonlin-earities of aerodynamic subsystem. Limit cycles can be closely identified through multiple input aerodynamic describing function representation, taking into account also the bias effect due {{to the use of}} non-symmetric airfoils. Traditional LCO analysis of sensitivity with respect to hinge moment of inertia is performed. Further, outburst points of limit cycle amplitude for varying Mach number and angle of attacks are investigated. By using developed aerodynamic describing function, it has been demonstrated that limit cycle analysis methods may still be used while including the effects of aerodynamic nonlinearities. Results from both methods, direct time marching and multiple input describing function, have been broadly compared for validation...|$|E

These results and a description of the pertinent numerical techniques are included...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} numerical {{results from}} a novel scheme for {{the solution of the}} flow equations in two dimensional domains by an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation able to cope with deforming and adaptive two dimensional grids without recurring to any explicit interpolation scheme. The method is applied to the investigation of a classical transonic aeroelastic instability phenomenon: the <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz.</b> By resorting to deforming and adaptive grids, the method allows to highlight the dependency of the aeroelastic stability boundaries on the mesh spacing...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is being {{conducted to determine}} the feasibility of studying <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz</b> {{by means of the}} wing-flow method. Two semispan models which had an aspect ratio of 6 and a taper ratio of 2 with quarter-chord half-span mass-balanced ailerons have been used. One had an NACA 23012 airfoil section and the second, an NACA 65 - 212 airfoil section. The ailerons on both models were subject to buzz over a small range of Mach number near 0. 9. Data obtained by wing-flow testing agreed reasonably well with full-scale flight results...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of tests up to a Mach number of 0. 92 at altitudes around 30, 000 feet. The data obtained {{show that the}} airplane can be flown to this Mach number above 30, 000 feet. Longitudinal trim changes have been experienced but the forces involved have been small. The elevator effectiveness decreased about one-half with increase of Mach number from 0. 70 to 0. 87. Buffeting has been experienced in level flight {{but it has been}} mild and the associated tail loads have been small. No <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz</b> or other flutter phenomena have been noted...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} calculating viscous effects in two- and three-dimensional unsteady transonic flow fields. An integral boundary-layer method for turbulent viscous flow is coupled with the transonic small disturbance potential equation in a quasi-steady manner. The viscous effects are modeled with Green's lag-entrainment equations for attached flow and an inverse boundary-layer method for flows that involve mild separation. The boundary-layer method is used stripwise to approximate three-dimensional effects. Applications are given for two-dimensional airfoils, <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz,</b> and a wing planform. Comparisons with inviscid calculations, other viscous calculation methods, and experimental data are presented. The results demonstrate that the present technique can economically and accurately calculate unsteady transonic flow fields that have viscous-inviscid interactions with mild flow separation...|$|E
40|$|A fully {{implicit}} multiblock aeroelastic solver, coupled thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations with structural equations of motion, {{has been}} developed for the flutter simulation on complex aerodynamic configurations. Navier-Stokes equations are solved with LU-SGS subiteration algorithm and a modified Harten-Lax-van Leer Einfeldt-Wada (HLLEW) scheme. Structural equations of motion are discretized by a direct second-order differential method with subiteration in generalized coordinates. The transfinite interpolation (TFI) {{is used for the}} grid deformation of the blocks neighboring the flexible surface. For the purpose of validation, the boundaries of the flutter speed and frequency of the AGARD 445. 6 standard aeroelastic wing are first calculated. Then, the method is used for the prediction of the flutter boundaries of the NAL supersonic transport (SST) fuselage-wing configuration.

40|$|Some illustrative results {{obtained}} from work accomplished under the aerothermoelasticity {{work breakdown structure}} (WBS) element of the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) Technology Maturation Program (TMP) are presented and discussed. The objectives of the aerothermoelasticity element were to develop analytical methods applicable to aerospace plane type configurations, to conduct analytical studies to identify potential problems, to evaluate potential solutions to problems, and to provide an experimental data base to verify codes and analytical trends.

40|$|Following {{an initial}} {{discussion}} of the NASP flight environment, the results of recent aeroelastic testing of NASP-type highly swept delta-wing models in Langley's Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) are summarized. Subsonic and transonic flutter characteristics {{of a variety of}} these models are described, and several analytical codes used to predict flutter of these models are evaluated. These codes generally provide good, but conservative predictions of subsonic and transonic flutter. Also, test results are presented on a nonlinear transonic phenomena known as <b>aileron</b> <b>buzz</b> which occurred in the wind tunnel on highly swept delta wings with full-span ailerons. An analytical procedure which assesses the effects of hypersonic heating on aeroelastic instabilities (aerothermoelasticity) is also described. This procedure accurately predicted flutter of a heated aluminum wing on which experimental data exists. Results are presented on the application of this method to calculate the flutter characteristics of a fine-element model of a generic NASP configuration. Finally, it is demonstrated analytically that active controls can be employed to improve the aeroelastic stability and ride quality of a generic NASP vehicle flying at hypersonic speeds...|$|E
