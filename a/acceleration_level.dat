40|$|Noise and {{building}} vibrations were measured {{for a series}} of helicopter and propeller-driven aircraft flyovers at WFF during May 1978. The building response data are compared with similar data acquired earlier at sites near Dulles and Kennedy Airports for operation of commercial jet transports, including the Concorde supersonic transport. Results show that noise-induced vibration levels in windows and walls are directly proportional to sound pressure level and that for a given noise <b>level,</b> the <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> induced by a helicopter or a propeller-driven aircraft flyover cannot be distinguished from the <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> induced by a commercial jet transport flyover. Noise-induced building <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> were found to be lower than those levels which might be expected to cause structural damage and were also lower than some <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> induced by such common domestic events as closing windows and doors...|$|R

50|$|The OFO {{experiment}} was originally designed for flight within the Apollo Applications Program, {{which was established}} to make optimum use of hardware used in Apollo lunar missions. However, because the low <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> needed for the experiment could not easily be maintained in a manned Apollo spacecraft, an unmanned satellite was later chosen as a more suitable vehicle. The satellite's design eliminated exposures to <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> above 10−3g (10 mm/s²). This meant that the experimental specimens could experience an almost weightless state.|$|R

40|$|Buildings {{are getting}} taller due to {{increased}} urbanisation and densification of cities. More advanced construction methods {{and the desire to}} construct impressive buildings is also supporting the trend. Due to their inherent slenderness resulting in low eigenfrequencies, these buildings are susceptible to wind-induced vibrations which can be highly disturbing for occupants. Already barely perceivable <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> within the low-frequency range relevant to whole-body vibrations can cause nausea and discomfort, while high <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> can cause alarm and fear amongst the occupants. The paper summarises acceptable <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> in high-rise buildings (here referred to as buildings over 200 m in height) stated in different building codes and previous work on the subject. Accelerations of a high-rise building subjected to wind-loads are evaluated using a full numerical model and one reduced with Ritz-vectors and the results are compared.

A measurement {{campaign has been}} carried out to individuate vibration <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> for different typologies of vehicles. Each vehicle passage has been considered as a single event. Vibration levels due to each single event have been measured by means of a data acquisition system. Measurement results allowed to individuate the relations among vibration levels, typology of vehicle, vehicle velocity and soil characteristics.

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} had {{a diameter}} of approximately 30 in (760 mm) and a length of 47 in (1,190 mm) The octagonal lower section of the spacecraft housed the electronic apparatus. The upper section, which contained the experiment package, was shaped like a truncated cone. A heat shield covering this upper section protected the experiment during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. A yo-yo de-spin assembly was located around the girth of the spacecraft. Four booms, folded {{against the side of}} the spacecraft, were located radially around the satellite. After the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle, the yo-yo despin subsystem slowed spacecraft rotation. The four booms were then released to extend from the side of the spacecraft. The extension of the booms increased the moment of inertia of the spacecraft, permitting the <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> to remain below 10−3g.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study using a passenger ride quality apparatus (PRQA) {{was conducted to}} determine the subjective reactions of passengers to roll vibrations. The data obtained illustrate the effect upon human comfort of several roll-vibration parameters: namely, roll <b>acceleration</b> <b>level,</b> roll frequency, and seat location (i. e., distance from axis of rotation). Results of {{an analysis of variance}} indicated that seat location had no effect on discomfort ratings of roll vibrations. The effect of roll <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> was significant, and discomfort ratings increased markedly with increasing roll <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> at all roll frequencies investigated. Of particular interest, {{is the fact that the}} relationship between discomfort ratings and roll <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> was linear in nature. The effect of roll frequency also was significant as was the interaction between roll <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> and roll frequency...|$|E

The purpose of the Beta-vane system is to reduce <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> at the dutch roll frequency whereas the function of the MSAS system is to reduce accelerations due to flexible body motions caused by turbulence.

The vibration was generated through an omni-loudspeaker and an impact hammer, measuring the <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> at the two-pipe crossed {{position on the}} reflectors. Results indicate that FG board shows higher vibration level than FG plus CRC board. In addition, impact hammer and onmi-loudspeaker show similar results in vibration responses: From the vibration <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> at midpoint of the reflectors, the frequency band of the first mode for FG plus CRC board is lower than FG board.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{necessary}} to control the noise and vibration with a high frequency caused by various trains, not only nearby the railway, {{but also in the}} station area. An innovative rail-damper was fabricated and evaluated for its effectiveness in vibration control and noise suppressing. From a long-term monitoring, rail-damper can reduce effectively the vibration and noise <b>acceleration</b> <b>level,</b> both along tracks and in platform. The results indicated that as the track was masked by the rail-damper, the train noise equivalent sound level can be reduced more than 3. 6 dB, and the vibration <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> could be reduced by an average of 6. 7 dB. For the vibration of the platform, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> was reduced by an average of 9. 3 dB. The rail- dampers can preferentially reduce the high-frequency part of the site vibration. The study herein would be useful to understand the feasibility of rail-damper for the noise and vibration control for the railway engineering...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for an experimental study directed to derive equal vibration discomfort curves, {{to determine the}} influence of vibration masking in order to account for the total discomfort of any random vibration, and to develop a scale of total vibration discomfort in the case of human response to whole-body vertical vibration. Discomfort is referred to as a subjective discomfort associated with the <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> of a particular frequency band. It is shown that passenger discomfort to whole-body vibration increases linearly with <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> for each frequency. Empirical data provide a mechanism for determining the degree of masking (or summation) of the discomfort of multiple frequency vibration.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for the vibration response of a spacecraft shroud {{to a range}} of in-flight fluctuation pressures. An Atlas-Agena 15 degree cone-cylinder shroud was analyzed during the present study, and three critical flight Mach numbers were considered. At transonic Mach numbers, the aerodynamic flow over the shroud is complex, involving zones of regular attached flow, separated flow, shock wave oscillation, and modified attached flows induced by local thickening of the boundary layer. The overall shroud vibration levels for a particular Mach number were determined by initially calculating the mean square <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> induced by the fluctuating pressures distributed over an individual zone, and then summing mean square <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> in one-third octave bands over all zones...|$|R

40|$|Presently {{manufacturers}} of surface mount assembly machines used predefined solutions for vacuum nozzle selection and <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> {{according to the}} package size. Usually this results lower production efficiency than maximum possible. The focus {{of this research is}} to make pick-and-place machines more intelligent in a way to determine operational parameters based on the input values of vacuum level and package size. Based on experimental data, mathematical model was developed which from the input values of vacuum level and package size, determines operational parameters, such as nozzle selection and <b>acceleration</b> <b>level,</b> hence minimizing operators influence. MYDATA MY 9 pick-and-place machine used in this work is equipped with two placement units; single and multi nozzle unit. Different nozzle materials are used at the nozzle tip such as plastic, rubber, ceramic and steel. The model is based on experimental data regarding Area of Contact, friction coefficient, acceleration, and off centred pick-up, after which compensation factors are included into the basic Newtonian law.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare three methods of estimating the audibility of aided speech using the Baha. Subjects: 23 Adult Baha users with primarily bilateral conductive hearing loss were recruited from the Bone Conduction Amplification Program at the Institute for Reconstructive Sciences in Medicine in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Methods: A test Baha was set to each subject's preferred listening level. The same Baha was used to assess the audibility of the long-term average speech spectrum (LTASS) for each of the following three approaches: 1) Aided soundfield thresholds, 2) Real Ear SPL, and 3) Real Head <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Level.</b> Results: Significant differences were discovered between the three approaches. Aided soundfield thresholds consistently over-estimated the sensation level of aided speech. The Real Ear SPL approach provided reasonable estimates in the mid-frequencies. However, low- and high-frequency estimates for the Real Ear approach have significant limitations. Conclusions: The Real Head <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Level</b> appears to be the most accurate method of determining aided audibility with the Baha...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the human ability to detect road surface type based on the associated steering wheel vibration feedback. Tangential direction acceleration time histories measured during road testing of a single mid-sized European automobile were {{used as the basis}} for the study. Scaled and frequency filtered copies of two base stimuli were presented to test subjects in a laboratory setting during two experiments which each involved 25 participants. Theory of signal detection (TSD) was adopted as the analytical framework and the results were summarised by means of the detectability index d’ and as receiver operating curve (ROC) points. The results of the experiment to investigate the effect of scaling suggested monotonic relationships between stimulus level and detection for both road surfaces. Detection of the tarmac surface improved with reductions in <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> while the opposite was true of the cobblestone surface.

40|$|Gas {{fluidization}} of a 0. 300 kg bed of {{silica powder}} {{and of a}} 0. 225 kg bed of potato starch powder has been studied in an 85 mm ID mechanically vibrated column. The effect of frequencies between 15 and 150 Hz has been explored at a relative <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> of a/g= 2. Fixing the frequency at 120 Hz for silica and 70 Hz for potato starch, the effect of <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> has been studied between a/g= 2 and a/g= 10. The aggregative behavior of the powders has been highlighted, and a model procedure is proposed to predict the aggregate size from the measurement of powder flow properties with conventional shear testers. It has been assumed that the aggregate size adjusts to the value that is sufficient to detach the aggregate under {{the effect of the}} inertia introduced by the acceleration due to mechanical vibrations.
