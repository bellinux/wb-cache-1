My house is neutral ground, and I {{did not think that}} anyone who used it would have had the treachery {{to turn it into a}} trap; still less did I imagine you would do so. These gentlemen would be perfectly within their right did they take you out and hang you from the nearest tree; but, for my sake, I trust that they will not do so; but should the American cavalry ever again visit this house under circumstances which may lead it to be supposed that they have been brought here to capture my guests, I shall let them punish you as you deserve. No word of mine will be raised in your favor. Now, sir, go, and never again enter this house, where the loathing and contempt that I feel for you will, I know, be shared by the ladies of my family." ...|$|E

"In America {{the same}} {{political}} labels (Democratic and Republican) cover virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized {{in the name of}} these two parties," [...] says Nelson W.

[...] "Yet Democrats <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> not everywhere the same. Variations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote, Democratic or Republican. These differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking something more like a hundred-party system." ...|$|E

The district had been in Republican hands for all but 14 years since 1947. Kratovil got a significant boost when Gilchrest endorsed Kratovil over Harris. In June, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) decided to back Kratovil's campaign financially through their Red to Blue program. [...] Kratovil, who is considered a moderate, has received endorsements not only from Democrats, but from local Eastern Shore Republicans.

The indictment charged that DeLay, Colyandro and Ellis conspired to pass corporate contributions to candidates for the Texas legislature in violation of Texas campaign finance law. Several corporations (such as Diversified Collection Services and Sears Roebuck) allegedly made contributions to TRMPAC. The indictment charged that TRMPAC then sent a check for $190,000 to the Republican National Committee, made payable to [...] "RNSEC" [...] (the Republican National State Elections Committee), along with a list of state-level Republican candidates who should receive the money.

5000|$|Suspected {{associations}} between GAA members <b>and</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>are</b> also {{said to have}} deepened mistrust. Two incidents of hunger strike commemorations on GAA grounds drew criticism from unionists, even though these incidents violated the GAA's rules. In response to one such incident, the Northern Ireland Assembly passed a motion calling on the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure {{to ensure that no}} sports club, which facilitates a commemoration or glorification of terrorism, receives financial support through his Department, either directly or indirectly. Other critics point out that the [...] "parish rule" [...] can appear to align the GAA with the Roman Catholic Church and others point to protectionist rules such as Rule 42 which prohibits competing, chiefly British, sports (referred to by some as [...] "garrison games" [...] or foreign sports) from GAA grounds. As a result, the GAA became a target for loyalist paramilitaries during the Troubles when a number of GAA supporters were killed and clubhouses damaged. As the profile of Gaelic football has been raised in Ulster so too has there been {{an increase in the number}} of sectarian attacks on Gaelic clubs in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|During his {{political}} campaign, Alexander's positions challenged the establishment, {{thinking of the}} mainstream political parties and pundits in the mainstream media. This included calling the Affordable Care Act a [...] "corporate giveaway" [...] that he called the “corporate restructuring of the healthcare system in America" [...] {{for the benefit of}} private healthcare companies, supporting private Chelsea Manning saying that [...] "whistleblowers should be protected not prosecuted," [...] criticizingthe impeachment of Paraguay's president (calling it a coup), that President Barack Obama represents the one percent not the 99 percent and that Bush-era policies of a surveillance state and permanent war have expanded under Obama's watch. Alexander has additionally demanded term limits for those in the Supreme Court and called for Justice Clarence Thomas to be impeached for not noting that he received $700,000 dollars on a government disclosure form and for attending [...] "secret meetings with conservative business leaders at an event sponsored and hosted by the Koch Brothers" [...] before the Citizens United vs. FEC decision. However, Alexander also took a jab at other third parties as well, like the Illinois Green Party noting that [...] "the big surprise of this election season is that another Third Party, the Illinois Green Party, not the Democrats <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> the ones resorting to dirty tricks...Rob Sherman the Chair of the Cook County Green Party...filed the challenge to get us thrown off the ballot...the innocent victim {{in all of this is}} Jill Stein...However, blocking the Socialist Party and other parties in Illinois will be a black eye for her campaign.

40|$|Objective. This article {{examines}} {{public opinion on}} the effectiveness and consequences of voter identification laws, focusing on the core issue in the Supreme Court's reasoning in the 2008 case that upheld an Indiana photo-ID law, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Method. We use a unique survey from New Mexico, where voter identification policies have recently undergone important changes. Questions in the survey examine whether voters think that ID laws protect against fraud and prevent legitimate participation, which point of view voters find more compelling, and whether attitudes toward voter identification are related to voter confidence. Results. Most voters think that voter ID laws prevent fraud, but many voters think that ensuring access to the polls {{is more important than}} preventing fraud. Among other variables that explain differences among individuals, partisanship plays an important role. Conclusion. The framing of voter identification policies {{plays an important role in}} how such laws are interpreted by the public <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> especially concerned about fraud in elections...|$|E
40|$|As the Supreme Court {{prepares to}} decide a key case {{involving}} states' requirements to recognize same-sex marriage, {{public support for}} allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally continues its rapid rise: A 57 %-majority of Americans now favor allowing same-sex marriage and 39 % oppose. As recently as five years ago, more opposed (48 %) same-sex marriage than supported it (42 %). This is {{the highest level of}} support measured for same-sex marriage in nearly 20 years of Pew Research Center polling of the issue. Yet even as support for same-sex marriage has increased among nearly all segments in the public, some groups remain broadly opposed to gay marriage. The Pew Research Center survey, conducted May 12 - 18 among 2, 002 adults, finds that partisans are as divided on this issue as ever: Today, 65 % of Democrats and an identical percentage of independents favor gay marriage; only about one third (34 %) of Republicans do so. Growing shares of all three groups support same-sex-marriage, yet the differences between Democrats <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> as wide today as they were a decade ago...|$|E
40|$|This {{month the}} Supreme Court {{is due to}} {{announce}} its decision in the King v. Burwell case, which will determine whether federally-run health care exchanges may provide subsidies to individuals under the Affordable Care Act. Many Republicans hope the Court rules that such subsidies may not be provided under {{the text of the}} statute, while some Democrats, including President Obama, argue that the case should never have been heard. But is the public’s opinion of the Supreme Court shaped by such partisan messages? In new research, Tom Clark and John Kastellec find that the public’s opinion of the court is shaped by messages from their co-partisans: among members of the public, Democrats <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> much more likely to support limitations to the independence of the Supreme Court when they are told that such limitations have been proposed by members of their own party. They write that while evaluations of the Supreme Court may be easily shaped by partisan attacks, so long as one party supports its decisions the Court may be insulated from this criticism to some degree...|$|E

Wall Street Journal, January 22, 2011 And if all others accepted the lie which the Party [...] . imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. “Who controls the past, ” ran the Party slogan, “controls the future: who controls the present controls the past. ” And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple {{model in which}} voters care about both {{economic}} and “cultural ” policy (noneconomic issues such as abortion). Democrats <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> ideologically differentiated and choose economic policy positions to maximize their respective probability of winning. Voters who are culturally and economically conservative or liberal strongly prefer one of the parties, while {{the boundary between the}} set of Democratic and Republican supporters is along a economically-conservative-sociallyliberal to economically-liberal-socially-conservative line. The change of the slope of this line over time tells us about changes in the relative importance of cultural and economic issues for vote choice. Using data from the American National Election Survey, we structurally estimate the model and show that the distribution of voter preferences in the American electorate remained relatively constant over the last 35 years. However, the importance of cultural factors relative to economic issues for the vote choice has increased significantly over the last generation. Also, policy preference intensity has increased substantially over the same time frame. These results are consistent with a view that parties have become much more internally homogeneous on cultural issues over the last generation, and that this is the factor that is driving polarization...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the fourth}} paper in a series {{examining}} aspects of voting in Iowa. This paper examines Iowa’s turnout in presidential and midterm elections since 2000 {{with a focus on}} party and age group. Iowa’s election statistics are reported for five age groups: 18 - 24, 25 - 34, 35 - 49, 50 - 64, and 65 and over. The different age ranges covered by the groups makes direct comparisons difficult, but changes during the period examined are evident as those registered to vote move from one age group to the next. The mix of registered Democrats and Republicans remains relatively stable across age groups during the period. Most striking in terms of voter registration is how No Party registrants go from more than 50 % of those in the youngest age group to only about 20 % of those in the oldest group. Looking at election turnout, the data show that there is a clear progression in improved turnout as voters age. In addition, older voters are more reliable, meaning differences in turnout between midterm and presidential elections are less pronounced for older age groups. Turnout differences between Democrats <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> generally small across all age groups, with Republicans nearly always having a slight advantage. Although the turnout percentage of No Party registrants also improves with age, they are always well below Democrats and Republicans...|$|E
