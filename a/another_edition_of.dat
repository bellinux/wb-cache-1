25|$|The 1980s of Peruvian {{football}} {{began to}} see notable changes in the competition format. The 1982 season saw the tournament played in group stages. Universitario advanced from its Metropolitan Group to Group B of the second stage and finally to the four-team group final, known as the Liguilla. Universitario successfully defeated all of its opponents in the Liguilla and reached its sixteenth first division title. The decisive victory was against Deportivo Municipal after a lone goal by Hugo Gastulo. In 1985, José Luis Carranza, to become an important icon of the club, debuted on the first team. Universitario won the Torneo Regional, or Regional Tournament, of the early season successfully remained {{at the top of}} the league by advancing to the Liguilla by placing second in the Torneo Descentrlizado and conquering the Liguilla by winning all five matches played, the last of which was a 4–0 win over Los Espartanos de Pacasmayo with goals by Miguel Seminario, Fidel Suárez, Eduardo Rey Muñoz and Jaime Drago. As Universitario won both tournaments of the season, they were automatically declared 1985 champions. Universitario de Deportes returned to the top of Peruvian football in 1987. As in 1985, Universitario began the season by winning the Regional Tournament, which put them in the season final to face off the winner of the Descentralizado for the national title. The Descentralizado went to their classic rival, Alianza Lima which meant the season final would be contested as <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Clásico. In addition, both Universitario and Alianza Lima reached the final with seventeen first division titles under their belts. The defining derby was won by Universitario with a single goal by Fidel Suárez, overcoming the tie they had in the most Peruvian titles.

500|$|Part of Whitman's {{role at the}} Attorney General's {{office was}} {{interviewing}} former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons. [...] "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, [...] "and you know I have a fancy for {{anything out of the}} ordinary."

500|$|In June 1840, Mary Shelley, Percy Florence (her one {{surviving}} child), {{and a few}} of his friends—George Defell, Julian Robinson, and Robert Leslie Ellis—began their European tour. They travelled to Paris {{and then}} to Metz. From there, they went down the Moselle by boat to Coblenz and then up the Rhine to Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Freiburg, Schaffhausen, Zürich, the Splügen, and Chiavenna. Feeling ill, Shelley rested at a spa in Baden-Baden; she had wracking pains in her head and [...] "convulsive shudders", symptoms of the meningioma that would eventually kill her. This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends, as it provided no entertainment for them; moreover, since none of them spoke German, the group was forced to remain together. After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway, the group spent two months at Lake Como, where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with Lord Byron at the lake one summer. The group then travelled on to Milan, and from there, Percy Florence and his friends soon left for Cambridge to take their university finals. Mary Shelley remained, waiting for funds to complete her journey. In September, she returned to England via Geneva and Paris. Upon her return, she became depressed and could not write: [...] " [...] I might live – as once I lived—hoping—loving—aspiring enjoying... I am placid now, & the days go by – I am happy in Percy [...] society & health – but no adjuncts... gild the quiet hours & dulness [...] creeps over my intellect". Despite this lethargy she managed to publish a second edition of Percy Shelley's prose and began working on <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> his poetry.|$|E
