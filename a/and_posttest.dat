50|$|Λp is the {{absolute}} difference between pre- <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> probability of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. A major factor for such an absolute difference {{is the power of}} the test itself, such as can be described in terms of, for example, sensitivity and specificity or likelihood ratio. Another factor is the pre-test probability, with a lower pre-test probability resulting in a lower absolute difference, with the consequence that even very powerful tests achieve a low absolute difference for very unlikely conditions in an individual (such as rare diseases in the absenceower can make a great difference for highly suspected conditions. The probabilities in this sense may also need to be considered in context of conditions that are not primary targets of the test, such as profile-relative probabilities in a differential diagnostic procedure.|$|E

50|$|ANOVA on ranks {{means that}} a {{standard}} analysis of variance is calculated on the rank-transformed data. Conducting factorial ANOVA on the ranks of original scores has also been suggested. However, Monte Carlo studies, and subsequent asymptotic studies found that the rank transformation is inappropriate for testing interaction effects in a 4x3 and a 2x2x2 factorial design. As the number of effects (i.e., main, interaction) become non-null, and as {{the magnitude of the}} non-null effects increase, there is an increase in Type I error, resulting in a complete failure of the statistic with as high as a 100% probability of making a false positive decision. Similarly, {{it was found that the}} rank transformation increasingly fails in the two dependent samples layout as the correlation between pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> scores increase. It was also discovered that the Type I error rate problem was exacerbated in the context of Analysis of Covariance, particularly as the correlation between the covariate and the dependent variable increased.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} fifth graders 2 ̆ 7 written responses to literature in dialogue journals. ^ Sixteen picture books from four different genres (fantasy, traditional literature, contemporary realistic fiction, and historical fiction) were read to twenty-three fifth graders. Students were asked to respond to the books in dialogue journals. ^ Pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> writing instruments, adapted from Diederich 2 ̆ 7 s (1974) analytical scale, were used to determine changes in writing after the dialogue journal process. Four raters scored the pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> writings, and analysis of variance was utilized to determine differences in the writings by sex and time. A significant interaction was found. Girls scored significantly higher on the pretest than the posttest. T-tests were conducted to determine significant differences between boys and girls both in the pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest.</b> The girls scored significantly higher than the boys on the pretest. ^ Both the pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> writings, as well as the dialogue journal entries, were examined in terms of the percentage of T-units (Hunt, 1965) of the Purves - Rippere (1968) categories of response (engagement, perception, interpretation, evaluation, and miscellaneous comments). A T-test was utilized to compare the frequency of occurrence of the categories in the pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> writings. A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine any significant frequency of occurrence of the Purves - Rippere (1968) categories in the dialogue journal entries within the four different genres of books read to the children. Frequencies of occurrence were significantly different for all categories, as determined by a Tukey (1977) test. In order of frequency of occurrence, these categories were engagement, evaluation, perception, interpretation, and miscellaneous statements. This was the order for all genres except fantasy, where miscellaneous comments were fourth in order of occurrence and interpretation was last. ^ It was concluded that the dialogue journals had been effective in eliciting more engagement responses, but students had not shown significant gains in their overall writing, as measured by the pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the effect of 8 -week Yogic practices on hematological variables and lipid profile of university level sports persons. Methods: Pretest <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> design was used. Experimental group (N = 10) allowed to undergo yogic practices for 8 weeks (six days a week), while control group (N = 10) maintained their daily routine activities. The selected Hematological variables that is White Blood Cells and Red Blood Cells and Lipid profile that is High Density Lipoprotein and Low Density Lipoprotein were examined by laboratory tests. For the analysis of data paired ‘t’ test was applied. Findings: There was insignificant reduction of white blood cells in experimental group [pretest value (8. 69 x 109 /L) <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> value (8. 66 x 109 /L) ], but the numbers of red blood cells has significantly improved in experimental group [pretest value (4. 46 x 1012 /L) <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> value (4. 59 x 1012 /L) ] after 8 week yogic training (P< 0. 05). With the yogic practices high density lipoprotein has also significantly improved in experimental group [pretest value (37 mg/dl) <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> value (55. 40 mg/dl) ] at (P< 0. 05). The low density lipoprotein has shown significant decrease in experimental group [pretest value (98. 50 mg/dl) <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> value (89. 30 mg/dl) ] after 8 week yogic training (P< 0. 05.) From the results, it can be predicted that, yoga practice is a cost-effective method which can be helpful to improve performance in sportsperson, especially in endurance sports. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that yogic practices enhance the Red blood cells and high density lipoprotein level and help to decrease the low density lipoprotein level among the sportsmen. *Author for correspondenc...|$|E
