In order to decrease the power of these noise sources, we should try to decrease the intensity of wakes after the trailing edge, i. e. the aerodynamic fields from pressure and suction sides would have to be almost the same near trailing edge.

40|$|International audienceThe {{acoustic}} response {{associated with}} squeal noise radiations {{is a hard}} issue due {{to the need to}} consider non-linearities of contact and friction, to solve the associated nonlinear dynamic problem and to calculate the noise emissions due to self-excited vibrations. In this work, {{the focus is on the}} calculation of the sound pressure in free space generated during squeal events. The calculation of the sound pressure can be performed by the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The inputs of this method are a boundary element model, a field of normal velocity characterized by a unique frequency. However, the field of velocity associated with friction-induced vibrations is composed of several harmonic components. So, the BEM equation has to be solved for each frequencies and in most cases, the number of harmonic component is significant. Therefore, the computation time can be prohibitive. The reduction of the number of harmonic component is a key point for the quick estimation of the squeal noise. The proposed approach is based on the detection and the selection of the predominant harmonic components in the mean square velocity. It is applied on two cases of squeal and allows us to consider only few frequencies. In this study, a new method will be proposed in order to quickly well estimate the noise emission in free space. This approach will be based on an approximated <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> of brake system which is assumed to be a punctual source, an interpolated directivity and the decrease of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels.</b> This method is applied on two classical cases of squeal with one and two unstable modes.

Ultrasound-induced nerve conduction block has been investigated in vitro and in vivo [1 - 4]. Foley et al.

The objective of this work is to investigate qualitative flow visualization of airflow behaviour around vehicle A-pillar and its potential to generate windnoise in this region. By means of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) under laboratory operating conditions, a series of three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations for the vortical flow around two simplified basic car models with different A-pillar/windshield geometry were carried out at different cruising speed. Both models were made with 60 ° flat inclination angles but with deferent A-pillar/windshield curvature, a small semi-ellipsoidal shape, a slanted sharp-edged shape. Investigations were carried out at velocities 60, 100 and 140 for 0 and 15 degrees yaw angles.

Particle acceleration during array formation is shown by experiment to be directly proportional to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>level,</b> indicating both fast and slow regimes of operation for this technique. Additionally, the time taken for particle arrays to form is shown to follow an inverse square relationship with particle size, allowing the possibility of sorting particles according to their size.

This was partly attributed to “nuisance ” loads that were deemed significant for “large” temperature lifts in the gas. Several measurements were performed to determine the cause of the discrepancies in pressures, temperatures, and cooling power between measured and predicted values. The possible influences of steady streaming flows, nuisance heat loads, gas mixture in-homogeneity and stack and heat exchanger performance were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{radiation}} force impulse imaging is an elastography method {{developed for}} ultrasound imaging that maps displacements produced by focused ultrasound pulses systematically applied to different locations. The resulting images are “stiffness weighted” and yield information about local mechanical tissue properties. Here, {{the feasibility of}} magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) was tested. Quasistatic MR elastography {{was used to measure}} focal displacements using a one-dimensional MRI pulse sequence. A 1. 63 or 1. 5 MHz transducer supplied ultrasound pulses which were triggered by the magnetic resonance imaging hardware to occur before a displacement-encoding gradient. Displacements in and around the focus were mapped in a tissue-mimicking phantom and in an ex vivo bovine kidney. They were readily observed and increased linearly with <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> in the phantom (R 2 = 0. 99). At higher <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels,</b> the displacement substantially increased and was associated with irreversible changes in the phantom. At these levels, transverse displacement components could also be detected. Displacements in the kidney were also observed and increased after thermal ablation. While the measurements need validation, the authors have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting small displacements induced by low-power ultrasound pulses using an efficient magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequence that is compatible with tracking of a dynamically steered ultrasound focal spot, and that the displacement increases with <b>acoustic</b> <b>power.</b> MR-ARFI has potential for elastography or to guide ultrasound therapies that use low-power pulsed ultrasound exposures, such as drug delivery...|$|R
40|$|Annual Summary Report: October 1992 - September 1993 Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedResearch on improving the efficiency, cooling power, and cooling power density of thermoacoustic refrigerators is described. A heuristic analysis of short thermoacoustic heat exchangers {{in a high}} amplitude sound field is given. A heat exchanger experiment, utilizing a very high amplitude thermoacoustic prime-mover, shows some agreement with the heuristic analysis. This indicates that acoustic losses in the heat exchanger can be drastically reduced in high amplitude engines, while maintaining good thermal effectiveness. Other related, but more applied, research is briefly discussed. This includes the design and construction of a compact, portable, air-cooled, thermoacoustic refrigerator {{for the purpose of}} producing frost at a lecture demonstration. This design has roughly the same temperature span (40 deg C) as required by shipboard applications. Also, two new electrodynamic acoustic drivers have been designed and one design has been constructed. These designs offer high efficiency, good power density, and low cost and are probably scalable up to significantly higher <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels.</b> Office of Naval Researc...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasound to casting processes {{is a subject}} of great interest: the resulting degassing, sonocrystallization, wetting, fragmentation, de-agglomeration and dispersion yield an improved cast material sonocrystallization,wetting, fragmentation, de-agglomeration and dispersion yield an improved cast material with fine grain structure. However, {{due to the lack}} of understanding of certain fundamentals involved in the process, the transfer and scale-up of this promising technology to industry has been hindered by difficulties in treating large volumes of liquid metal. Experimental results of ultrasonic processing of liquid aluminium with a 5 -kW magnetostrictive transducer and a 20 -mmniobiumsonotrode producing 17 -kHz ultrasonic waves are reported in this study. A high-temperature cavitometer sensor that is placed at different locations in the liquid melt, measured cavitation activity at various <b>acoustic</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> and in different temperature ranges. The highest cavitation intensity in the liquid bulk is achieved below the surface of the sonotrode, at the lowest temperature, and when the applied power was 3. 5 kW. Understanding these ultrasonication mechanisms in liquid metals will result in a major breakthrough for the optimization of ultrasound applications in metal industries...|$|R
