5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made <b>a</b> <b>Gentleman</b> of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E

5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.

In this ethos, <b>a</b> <b>gentleman</b> was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating.
