5|$|Amy is a playable {{character}} in Sonic <b>Advance</b> 1, 2 and 3, platformers for the Game Boy <b>Advance.</b> With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from building an empire. Although in Sonic <b>Advance</b> Amy's attacking power was restricted by her inability to spin while jumping (unlike those of the other characters), this was changed in the latter two games.|$|E
5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the <b>advance,</b> the scorer may rule that the <b>advance</b> was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an <b>advance</b> but then elects not to throw, the <b>advance</b> is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E

5|$|Sonic <b>Advance</b> 3 was {{published}} by Sega in Japan and by THQ in North America and Europe. Like <b>Advance</b> 1 and 2, its development was shared by Dimps and Sega subsidiary Sonic Team since the latter was understaffed on employees familiar with the Game Boy <b>Advance</b> hardware. Yuji Naka, then President of Sonic Team, had limited involvement {{in the development of}} Sonic <b>Advance</b> 3, and he conceived of the team-up dynamic. While the game is fundamentally 2D, it features some Mode 7 3D rotation effects. THQ announced the game in a press release on September 11, 2003. The game was later exhibited at E3 2003.|$|E

5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} the <b>advance</b> of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to {{leapfrog}} existing units occupying the Red line and <b>advance</b> to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the <b>advance</b> of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, the <b>advance</b> halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the <b>advance</b> recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported <b>advance</b> via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.|$|E

5|$|When a baserunner {{is able to}} <b>advance</b> after a {{pitch is}} not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the <b>advance</b> was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can <b>advance,</b> the <b>advance</b> is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an <b>advance</b> with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the <b>advance.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} <b>advance</b> because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines.

5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest while Sattelberg was {{captured}} by the 26th Brigade, in late November the 2/15th joined the <b>advance</b> to Wareo, capturing Nongora village, crossing the Song River, and then undertaking patrols through the Christmas Hills until relieved by elements of the 4th Brigade, which pushed the Australian <b>advance</b> along the coast, forcing the Japanese north towards Sio as the Australians sought to secure the Huon Peninsula. In late December, the 20th Brigade rotated back into the lead, and the 2/15th took over from the 22nd Battalion around the Tunom River, where the battalion headquarters came under aerial attack. After a brief pause near the flood swollen Tunom, the <b>advance</b> continued throughout December and into January 1944 with minor skirmishes punctuating the battalion's <b>advance.</b> Finally, on 21 January, {{at the edge of the}} Sazomu River, the order arrived for the 2/15th to be withdrawn to Finschhafen for rest prior to repatriation to Australia. The fighting in New Guinea cost the battalion 30 killed in action, six dead from wounds, four dead from accidents and 119 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, both sides had large numbers of troops available for redeployment, and the British decided to move their Suez Canal defences from positions on the canal eastwards into the Sinai desert. Murray aimed to extend the railway and water pipeline to Katia, so that a permanent forward Imperial base of 50,000 men could be established. In February 1916, he requested permission from the War Office in London to extend this infrastructure further across the Sinai to El Arish. He considered that such an <b>advance</b> along the northern route, combined with the destruction of the central route's water sources and regular patrols from a base at El Arish, would permanently secure the Suez Canal. An <b>advance</b> to Katia was agreed by the War Office, but no decision was made regarding an <b>advance</b> to El Arish.|$|E

5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to <b>advance</b> on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to <b>advance</b> if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to <b>advance</b> only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to <b>advance</b> to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
