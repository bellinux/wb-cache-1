Because {{there are no}} retail sales taxes in tropical Africa, a comparison is made with the retail sales taxes of two relatively small non-African countries — Barbados and Iceland.

Finally, a number of merits and criticisms of these taxes are pointed out. A number of general conclusions are suggested from the inspection of these six sales taxes. It is found that in a developing country a sales tax can be a very significant revenue source and sales taxes at the manufacturing level can function extremely well. A general problem has been the failure to develop adequate <b>audit</b> <b>programmes,</b> and also the need for simplicity in tax structure and operation has often been overlooked. There are serious dangers in placing sales tax administration under the jurisdiction of customs and excise departments because the personnel in these departments generally lack the accounting knowledge necessary to effectively administer a sales tax.

40|$|The {{audit risk}} model {{has become an}} {{extremely}} important element in audit practice. The basic intuition behind the model is that changes in risk should affect {{the work of the}} auditor. However, little systematic empirical evidence has been published on the assessment of audit risk and its effect on audit work. This study, using documentation from actual audits and follow-up interviews, provides such evidence. Assessments of audit risk and <b>audit</b> <b>programme</b> details have been obtained from eight clients of four Dutch audit firms. Audit risk assessments are obtained for two risk categories: (1) audit risk factors, such as the degree of client management turnover or the quality of the client's internal audit department; and (2) audit risk model variables (inherent or control risk), related to the account or assertion being audited. The results indicate that there is substantial variation in audit risk factors between clients and among the audit risk factors per client. To a lesser extent these findings hold for the risk model variables. The study also indicates that to some degree there is risk variation over time. Variability of risk factor assess-ments over time is higher than variability of risk model variable assessments over time. Audit programmes differ substantially between clients and, to a lesser extent, over time. Interestingly, the only two engagements with a change in the <b>audit</b> <b>programme</b> were the clients with most risk factor changes. The study also identifies factors other than risk, such as a change in the audit team, that influence <b>audit</b> <b>programme</b> planning. The observation in Dutch audit practice of variation in both risk assessments and audit programmes highlights the opportunity to design risk-adjusted audits, which are both efficient and effective. In addition, this observation encourages the carrying out of further research to fine-tune our models concerning which factors are most important within the audit risk model and to the audit planning process. ...|$|E

40|$|Judging by only {{economic}} incentives, Malaysian {{financial institutions}} (particularly banks) should completely ignore the Competition Act. The {{data show that}} Malaysian banks probably benefit from anti-competitive behaviour. Political and family connections likely facilitate such behaviour. Given that the Malaysian Competition Commission will likely lack the resources to investigate and sanction anti-competitive behaviour in Malaysia’s banking industry – the banks’ best response to the Act probably consists of ignoring it. Maximum fines of 10 million ringgit and revenue-tied penalties of only 10 % of worldwide revenue mean that banks still have strong incentives to engage in anti-competitive behaviour and to pay any low fine that might be levied. The best compliance programme for banks in Malaysia likely consists of actions that avoid detection rather than detecting and preventing anti-competitive behaviour.
