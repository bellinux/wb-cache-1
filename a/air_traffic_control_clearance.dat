50|$|To {{practice}} {{take off}} and landing, a pilot would often fly many patterns, one after another, from the same runway. Upon each landing, depending on the runway distance remaining, aircraft and pilot capabilities, noise abatement procedures in effect, and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearance,</b> the pilot will perform either a full stop landing (taxi to the runway beginning for subsequent take-off), a touch-and-go (stabilize in the landing roll, reconfigure the aircraft for take-off, and take-off without ever stopping the aircraft), or a stop-and-go (decelerate to a stop, then take-off from the remaining runway). In the U.S., when operating in a controlled airport a pilot can be cleared for the option, allowing any of the landing options above, or a rejected landing, at pilot's discretion.|$|E

5000|$|Next Generation Data Communications (Data Comm). Current {{communications}} between aircrew and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control,</b> and between <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers, are largely by voice. Initially, {{the introduction of}} data communications will provide an additional means of two-way communication for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearances,</b> instructions, advisories, flight crew requests and reports. With the majority of aircraft data link equipped, the exchange of routine controller-pilot messages and clearances via data link will enable controllers to handle more traffic. This will improve <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller productivity, enhancing capacity and safety.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} pilots {{are required to}} get an <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) <b>clearance,</b> or in absence of a controller, advise the nearest flight service station or center.|$|R
50|$|Voice {{communications}} {{contribute to}} operational errors due to miscommunication, stolen clearances (an <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearance</b> for one aircraft is heard and erroneously accepted by another aircraft) and delayed message transfers due to radio frequency congestion. Data communications will enable {{air traffic controller}} productivity improvements and will permit capacity growth without requisite growth in costs associated with infrastructure equipment, maintenance, labor and training. As a result, the resources required to provide air traffic management service per aircraft operation will decrease. The use of real-time aircraft data by ground systems to plot 4-dimensional trajectories (lateral and vertical navigation, ground speed and longitudinal navigation), and perform conformance management, will shift air traffic operations from minute-by-minute tactical control, to more predictable and planned strategic traffic management.|$|E
50|$|The FAA issues Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) in {{the form}} of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) which are {{effective}} for the duration of an event, typically a few days or weeks. TFRs are issued for VIP movement such as the President's travels outside Washington, D.C., surface-based hazards to flight such as toxic gas spills or volcanic eruptions, air-shows, military security, and special events including political ones like national party conventions. TFRs have also been issued to ensure a safe environment for firefighting operations in the case of wildfires and for other reasons as necessary. A TFR was quickly issued around the crash site of Cory Lidle's airplane in New York City. Later, a broader TFR was issued to require pilots traveling over the East River to obtain <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 583: The Tenerife airport disaster, which {{occurred}} on March 27, 1977, remains the accident {{with the highest}} number of airliner passenger fatalities. 583 people died when a KLM Boeing 747 attempted to take off without clearance, and collided with a taxiing Pan Am 747 at Los Rodeos Airport on the Canary Island of Tenerife, Spain. There were no survivors from the KLM aircraft; 61 of the 396 passengers and crew on the Pan Am aircraft survived. Pilot error was the primary cause, as the KLM captain began his takeoff run without obtaining <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearance.</b> A contributing factor was the dense fog. The KLM flight crew could not see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision. The accident had a lasting influence on the industry, particularly in the area of communication. An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control (ATC) communication by both controllers and pilots alike. [...] "Cockpit Resource Management" [...] has also been incorporated into flight crew training. The captain is no longer considered infallible, and combined crew input is encouraged during aircraft operations.|$|E
50|$|The Future Air Navigation System (FANS) is an {{avionics}} system which provides direct data link {{communication between the}} pilot and the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller. The communications include <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearances,</b> pilot requests and position reporting. In the FANS-B equipped Airbus A320 family aircraft, an <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Services Unit (ATSU) and a VHF Data Link radio (VDR3) in the avionics rack and two data link control and display units (DCDUs) in the cockpit enable the flight crew to read and answer the controller-pilot data link communications (CPDLC) messages received from the ground.|$|R

5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearances.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) officially {{defines the}} word [...] "roger" [...] to mean [...] "I have {{received}} {{all of your}} transmission."

However, in modern times, pilots must read back (repeat) <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>clearances</b> to verify they heard them correctly, but most instructions may be [...] "rogered."

40|$|SESAR) {{concepts}} {{require an}} {{increased use of}} trajectory-based operations, including extensive strategic <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>clearances.</b> The clearances can be lengthy and complex, which necessitates data link communications to allow for message permanence and integration into the autoflight systems (i. e., “autoload ” capability). This paper examines the use of flight deck data link communications for strategic and tactical clearance usage in the terminal area. A human-in-the-loop simulation was conducted using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, with ten commercial flight crews as participants. Data were collected from six flight scenarios in the San Francisco terminal airspace. The variables of interest were ATC message modality (voice v. data link), temporal aspect of the message (tactical v. strategic) and message length. Dependent variables were message response times, communication clarifications, communication-related errors, and pilot workload. Response time results were longer in data link compared to voice, a finding that has been consistently revealed {{in a number of}} other simulations [1]. In addition, strategic clearances and longer messages resulted in a greater number of clarifications and errors, suggesting an increase in uncertainty of message interpretation for the flight crews when compared to tactical clearances. The implications for strategic and compound clearance usage in NextGen and SESAR are discussed...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{to study how}} automation, when {{used in conjunction with}} datalink for the delivery of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) <b>clearance</b> amendments, affects the situational awareness of aircrews was conducted. The study was focused on the relationship of situational awareness to automated Flight Management System (FMS) programming and the readback of ATC clearances. Situational awareness was tested by issuing nominally unacceptable ATC clearances and measuring whether the error was detected by the subject pilots. The experiment also varied the mode of clearance delivery: Verbal, Textual, and Graphical. The error detection performance and pilot preference results indicate that the automated programming of the FMS may be superior to manual programming. It is believed that automated FMS programming may relieve some of the cognitive load, allowing pilots to concentrate on the strategic implications of a clearance amendment. Also, readback appears to have value, but the small sample size precludes a definite conclusion. Furthermore, because textual and graphical modes of delivery offer different but complementary advantages for cognitive processing, a combination of these modes of delivery may be advantageous in a datalink presentation...|$|R
