5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Mick Foley faced Ric Flair in a 2-Out-of-3 Falls Match. Foley gained the {{advantage}} after he executed a Double Underhook DDT. Foley {{then began to}} taunt Flair <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> Mr. Socko, a dirty sock puppet, dressed like Flair. Foley controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the Figure-Four Leglock, but Flair countered with an inside cradle over Foley to win the first fall. Frustrated, Foley grabbed a trash can from under the ring {{and brought it to}} the ring to hit Flair with it. But, Flair avoided the attacked, as he tripped Foley to apply the Figure-Four Leglock. At the end, Foley got disqualified when he hit Flair with the trash can. The referee awarded Flair the win. After the match, Foley attacked Flair with a barb-wired bat, leaving Flair busted open.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah's {{longtime}} {{composer and}} collaborator Jerry Fielding {{was hired to}} do the film score for The Getaway. He had worked previously with the director on Noon Wine (1966), The Wild Bunch (1969), Straw Dogs (1970), and Junior Bonner. After the film's second preview screening, McQueen was unhappy with the music and used his clout to hire Quincy Jones to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured harmonica solos by Toots Thielemans and vocals by Don Elliott, both {{of whom had been}} his associates. Peckinpah was unhappy with this action <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> a full-page ad in Daily Variety on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) and The Killer Elite (1975). Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe award for his original score.|$|E

5|$|Just after Cole's C-130 left Khâm Đức, a C-123 {{flown by}} Major Ray D. Shelton landed <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> 44 U.S. {{engineers}} and 21 South Vietnamese civilians. Shortly after Shelton had landed his aircraft, {{he reported that}} enemy fire was coming in from all quadrants, but {{he was able to}} take off safely after just three minutes on the ground. By 11:10, just 145 people had been evacuated by Shelton's aircraft, and a handful of helicopters. After that, another three C-130s also arrived in the vicinity of Khâm Đức, but the pilots were told not to try landings. In the afternoon, the C-130 Hercules resumed their operations; at 15:25, Major Bernard L. Bucher's C-130 approached Khâm Đức's airfield from the south and landed despite taking numerous hits. Some 150 Vietnamese women and children rushed onto the aircraft; as soon as the aircraft was full, Bucher made his takeoff in the north direction, unaware that opposing forces were concentrated in that area. At 15:30 Bucher took off, and his aircraft was quickly riddled by ground fire; it crashed {{less than a mile from}} the end of the runway. All the South Vietnamese civilians and the U.S. aircrew died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Two {{companies}} of the 1st Hampshires landed {{very close to}} the strong point at Le Hamel, and had to fight inland through enemy garrisons to get off the beach. Attempts to flank Le Hamel were made difficult by the surrounding machine gun placements, mines, and barbed wire. Elements of the 1st Hampshires captured the German strongpoint WN-36 at {{the eastern edge of the}} village of Asnelles. When they turned west to move along the beach towards their primary objective at Le Hamel, they came under heavy fire and had to break off the attack. Major Warren, in charge after the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Smith was wounded, decided that the troops would have to circle around and attack the emplacement from the rear, a process that took several hours. The troops began to have some success around 15:00 with the arrival of an AVRE tank of 82nd Assault Squadron. The tank fired two petards into the sanatorium, where most of the defenders were located. The German soldiers fled into fortified houses in Le Hamel and Asnelles, and were taken out in house-to-house combat. Few surrendered. The 75mm gun was finally silenced at 16:00, when the AVRE tank fired a large petard charge into the rear entrance of the casemate. C/A Company, 1st Hampshires and the AVRE tank proceeded west along the beach <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> strongpoint WN-38 at La Fontaine St Côme, taking 20 prisoners. Still further west, D Company captured strong point WN-39 at the Arromanches radar station, capturing 30 more defenders.|$|E

Newly formed groups created websites <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> advertisements in The New York Times and elsewhere meant to influence the Board's decision.|$|E
25|$|Bullen {{continued}} {{to support the}} Spanish in operations along the Catalan coast. On 14 April boats from Cambrian cut out a settee carrying grain from Port Vendee to Barcelona that had sheltered {{under the protection of}} batteries on the Medes Islands. More importantly, on 12 and 14 April, Cambrian and Volontaire took possession of St. Philion and Palamós. There they destroyed the batteries <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> their guns. This, together with the Spanish capture of Figueras, gave the Spanish control of almost all Catalonia, save Barcelona.|$|E

25|$|In 1519, Holbein {{moved back}} to Basel. His brother fades from the record at about this time, and it is usually presumed that he died. Holbein re-established himself rapidly in the city, running a busy workshop. He joined the painters' guild <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> Basel citizenship. He married Elsbeth Schmid, a widow {{a few years older}} than he was, who had an infant son, Franz, and was running her late husband's tanning business. She bore Holbein a son of his own, Philipp, in their first year of marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> a couple of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld {{decided not}} to wear his glasses {{in the first round}} of the 2015 World Championship <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> {{finishes}} of 167 and 170 in beating Rowby-John Rodriguez 3–0. He was then involved in three successive matches in which there was never a set between Van Barneveld and his opponent as he edged past Jamie Caven 4–3, Adrian Lewis 4–3 (Lewis missed one match dart) and Stephen Bunting 5–4. In the Bunting match he returned from a break after the fourth set with his glasses on explaining afterwards that the board was looking blurry. Van Barneveld looked to have got himself back into his semi-final meeting with Phil Taylor when he recovered from 2–0 down to draw level, but his lengthy previous matches seemed to take effect as he could not win another set to be defeated 6–2. At the Masters he knocked out newly crowned world champion Gary Anderson 11–6 in the semi-finals, but was beaten by a reversal of this scoreline against Michael van Gerwen in the final.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} the post-WrestleMania episode of Raw, Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H had masterminded the attack on The Shield on the previous month's SmackDown and as a result, when Triple H faced the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan in a title match after Bryan had already been attacked by Kane, Orton and Batista, The Shield interrupted the match to turn on Triple H, chasing the other wrestlers away to protect Bryan. The Shield finally defeated The Wyatt Family in a six-man tag match on the April 8 episode of Main Event. On the April 14 episode of Raw, Triple H forced The Shield to wrestle an 11-on-3 handicap match, which ended in a no contest and left The Shield outnumbered and beaten down before being further attacked by Triple H, Orton and Batista, who reformed the group Evolution. Booked to wrestle another 11-on-3 handicap match on the April 25 episode of SmackDown, The Shield attacked <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> six of their opponents throughout SmackDown and defeated the remaining five in the handicap match. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, Ambrose retained the United States Championship in a fatal four-way match against Alberto Del Rio, Curtis Axel and Ryback.|$|E
25|$|Glacier then {{entered a}} feud with Perry Saturn, {{starting}} with an angle {{in which he}} cut a promo on the May 11 Nitro declaring that his Cryonic Kick finisher was his own move and threatened to take out anyone who used it. This prompted a response from Saturn on Thunder later in the week, in which he lambasted Glacier for his in-ring appearance and his claiming ownership of the superkick. Starting with a pin of Sick Boy on May 18 after Saturn's outside interference was unsuccessful, Glacier then fought a series of matches against several other members of Raven's Flock. He and Saturn then alternated wins on WCW Thunder, but the most notable aspect of the angle was that Kanyon, who had recently shed the Mortis gimmick, was regularly conducting sneak attacks on Raven and the Flock in various disguises. On the June 4 edition of Thunder, Kanyon (disguised as referee Nick Patrick) entered the ring <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> Saturn with a Russian legsweep, allowing Glacier to get the win, and flashed the Mortis mask to Glacier before leaving the ring. The feud died down shortly thereafter when Saturn was {{moved to a new}} angle involving Raven and the breakup of the Flock. A Glacier-Saturn matchup (won by Saturn) that aired on WCW Worldwide on September 26 was the last match broadcast on the program before its format was changed to a recap show.|$|E
