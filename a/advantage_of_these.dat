5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers have taken <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, {{with the approval of}} the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The later 860s saw a {{reduction}} of activity by the Foreigners—although the Annals indignantly report that they plundered the ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth in 863—with the Dublin forces active in Pictland and in the six months' siege of Dumbarton Rock. Áed Findliath took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> absences to destroy the Viking fortresses {{in the north of}} Ireland. Amlaíb left Ireland for good in 871 and Ímar died in 873. With their disappearance, there were frequent changes of leadership among the Foreigners {{and a great deal of}} internecine conflict is reported for the following decades.|$|E

5|$|With the {{popularity}} of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if Brütal Legend would take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less skilled players, bonus coins and 1-ups are more abundant in earlier worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for more experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play time. The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures {{as a means of}} providing him with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a centaur but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail that allows limited flying ability. Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were designed to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> abilities. New enemies were included to add diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as Goombas, Hammer Bros., and Koopa Troopas.|$|E
25|$|Some CPU designs {{can perform}} some {{optimizations}} at runtime. Some examples include Out-of-order execution, Speculative execution, Instruction pipelines, and Branch predictors.

25|$|Interstellar {{space is}} not {{completely}} empty; it contains trillions of icy bodies ranging from small asteroids (Oort cloud) to possible rogue planets.

25|$|CRA {{regulations}} give {{community groups}} {{the right to}} comment on or protest banks' purported non-compliance with CRA. Such comments could help or hinder banks' planned expansions.

25|$|During the 1909–1910 period, Curtiss {{employed}} {{a number of}} demonstration pilots, including Eugene Ely, Charles K. Hamilton, Augustus Post and Hugh Robinson.

25|$|She sailed the North Atlantic run between Le Havre and New York for {{thirteen}} years. By {{the beginning}} of the 1970s jet travel was by far more popular than ship travel, and the cost of fuel was ever increasing. The France, which had always relied on subsidies from the French government, was forced to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> subsidies more and more.|$|E
25|$|The Arabs {{crossed over}} to the other side of the Indus River, abandoning all their lands to the victorious Hindus. The local chieftains took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{conditions}} to re-establish their independence. Subsequently, the Arabs constructed the city of Mansurah on the other side of the wide and deep Indus, which was safe from attack. This became their new capital in Sindh. Thus began the reign of the imperial Gurjara-Pratiharas.|$|E

25|$|Borane adducts with phosphines and amines {{are also}} available. Borane makes a strong adduct with triethylamine; using this adduct {{requires}} harsher conditions in hydroboration. This can be advantageous for {{cases such as}} hydroborating trienes to avoid polymerization. More sterically hindered tertiary and silyl amines can deliver borane to alkenes at room temperature. A few examples are shown below. Another <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> borane complexes {{is that it is}} possible to recover the amine carriers.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} reactivity, another {{distinct}} <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two variants is that kinetically {{they provide a}} difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction is very well established, and enantioselective variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol. Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Sun formed Suncor by merging its Canadian {{refining}} and retailing {{interests with}} Great Canadian Oil Sands and its conventional {{oil and gas}} interests. In 1981, the Government of Ontario purchased a 25% {{stake in the company}} but divested it in 1993. In 1995 Sun Oil also divested its interest in the company, although Suncor maintained the Sunoco retail brand in Canada. Suncor took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two divestitures to become an independent, widely held public company.|$|E

25|$|Scary was {{a village}} in the {{northern}} part of the Eastfarthing at the southern feet of the Hills of Scary. A road ran south from Scary to cross the Water at Budgeford and join the Great East Road at Whitfurrows. During the War of the Ring, provisions were stored in the quarry east of Scary by the Chief's Men, and after the Scouring of the Shire the Hobbits took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> stores for the Yule holiday.|$|E
25|$|During the winter, belugas {{commonly}} become {{trapped in}} the ice {{without being able to}} escape to open water, which may be several kilometres away. Polar bears take particular <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> situations and are able to locate the belugas using their sense of smell. The bears swipe at the belugas and drag them onto the ice to eat them. They are able to capture large individuals in this way; in one documented incident, a bear weighing between 150 and 180kg was able to capture an animal that weighed 935kg.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{responses}} to escape predation include burrowing into substrate and being active {{only through a}} restricted period of the day. Furthermore, insects may feign death, a response termed thanatosis. Beetles, particularly weevils, are especially fond {{of this sort of}} acting. Bright colors may also be flashed underneath cryptic ones. A startle display occurs when prey takes <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> markings after being discovered by a predator. The striking color pattern, which often includes eyespots, is intended to evoke prompt enemy retreat. Better formed eyespots seem to result in better deterrence.|$|E
