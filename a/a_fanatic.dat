5|$|The most {{influential}} retelling, {{which according to}} many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten, was {{a story in the}} January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, entitled J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship Marie Celeste, the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white race, has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the rest of the ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously, but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{prospect}} of a conflict with the house of Austria offended a great part of the Catholics of France, notably the court. Marie de Médicis and the duke D' Épernon were notable members of this party. It was in this context that Henry was assassinated by <b>a</b> <b>fanatic,</b> Ravaillac, which put a stop to his project.|$|E
25|$|The {{coming of}} the Crusades (starting with the {{massacre}} of Barbastro) and similarly entrenched positions on the northern African Almoravids, who took over al-Andalus as of 1086, added to the difficult coexistence between communities, including Muslims in Christian ruled territory, or the Mozarabic rite Christians (quite {{different from those of}} the northern kingdoms), and further minority groups. The Almohads, <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> north African sect, pushed the boundaries of religious intolerance during their occupation of al-Andalus, affecting also the Jews.|$|E

Despite Miri working at the local shopping mall and Zack working at a coffee shop, they have not paid their utility bills in months, with Zack devoting much of his free time to <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> following of the Pittsburgh Penguins and his status in the community amateur hockey team, the Monroeville Zombies.

25|$|Although Oswald Garrison Villard's 1910 {{biography}} of Brown {{was thought to}} be friendly (Villard being the grandson of abolitionist Garrison), he also added fuel to the anti-Brown fire by criticizing him as a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling, and homicidal madman. Villard himself was a pacifist and admired Brown in many respects, but his interpretation of the facts provided a paradigm for later anti-Brown writers. By the mid-20th century, some scholars were fairly convinced that John Brown was <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> and killer, while some African Americans sustained a positive view of the man.|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{of slaves}} found freedom by fleeing from their masters, forming {{communities}} of maroons and raiding isolated plantations. The most famous was Mackandal, a one-armed slave, originally from Guinea, who escaped in 1751. A Vodou Houngan (priest), he united {{many of the}} different maroon bands. He spent {{the next six years}} staging successful raids and evading capture by the French, reputedly killing over 6,000 people, while preaching <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> vision of the destruction of white civilization in St. Domingue. In 1758, after a failed plot to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners, he was captured and burned alive at the public square in Cap-Français.|$|E

25|$|Among the European settlers, hoop-rolling was a {{seasonal}} sport, seeing the greatest {{activity in the}} winter. Children, besides rolling the hoops, also tossed them back and forth, catching them on their sticks. In the 1830s, hoop trundling {{was seen as an}} activity so characteristic of the young that it was adopted by <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> sect in Kentucky whose members mimicked children's activities in order to gain access to heaven. Hoop driving was also seen as a remedy for the sedentary and overprotected lives led by many American girls of the mid-19th century. The game was popular with both girls and boys: in an 1898 survey of 1000 boys and 1000 girls in Massachusetts, both the girls and the boys named hoop and stick their favorite toy. In Ohio, the wood of the American elm (Ulmus americana) was particularly valued for making hoop-poles.|$|E
25|$|Moving to London in 1545, Bourne {{became a}} prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1549 Archdeacon of Bedford with the {{benefice}} of rector of High Ongar in Essex. At the time, {{the holding of}} such preferments involved acceptance of the Church of England as brought into being under King Henry VIII and his son Edward VI. Soon after Queen Mary's accession, while preaching at St Paul's Cross, Bourne narrowly escaped a dagger which <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> hurled at him on hearing him allude to Bishop Edmund Bonner's recent sufferings under the previous reign. On being appointed to the Bishopric of Bath and Wells, Bourne received absolution from Cardinal Reginald Pole, the papal legate, by letters dated 17 March 1554, from all censures incurred {{in the time of}} schism, and on 1 April was consecrated with five others by Bishop Bonner, assisted by Bishop Stephen Gardiner and Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a Squad Leader, serving with Company C, First Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Shima in the Ryukyu Islands, 7 May 1945. When his squad was suddenly assailed by extremely heavy small-arms fire from the front during a determined advance against strongly fortified, fiercely defended Japanese positions, Corporal Fardy temporarily deployed his men along a near-by drainage ditch. Shortly thereafter, an enemy grenade fell among the Marines in the ditch. Instantly throwing himself upon the deadly missile, Corporal Fardy absorbed the exploding blast in his own body, thereby protecting his comrades from certain and perhaps fatal injuries. Concerned solely for the welfare of his men, he willingly relinquished his own hope of survival that his fellow Marines might live to carry on the fight against <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> enemy. A stouthearted leader and indomitable fighter, Corporal Fardy, by his prompt decision and resolute spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death, had rendered valiant service, and his conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with the Weapons Company, Twentyseventh Marines, Fifth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 8 March 1945. Filling a gap in the front lines during a critical phase of the battle, Private First Class LaBelle had dug into a foxhole with two other Marines and grimly aware of the enemy's persistent attempts to blast a way through our lines with hand grenades, applied himself with steady concentration to maintaining a sharply vigilant watch during the hazardous night hours. Suddenly a hostile grenade landed beyond reach in his foxhole. Quickly estimating the situation, he determined to save the others if possible, shouted a warning and instantly dived on the missile, absorbing the exploding charge in his own body and thereby protecting his comrades from serious injury. Stouthearted and indomitable, he had unhesitatingly relinquished his own chance of survival that his fellow Marines might carry on the relentless fight against <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> enemy and, his dauntless courage, cool decision and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflect the highest credit upon Private First Class LaBelle and the United States Naval Service.

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a Rifleman with Company I, Third Battalion, Twenty-sixth Marines, Fifth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 3 March 1945. Consistently aggressive, Private First Class Caddy boldly defied shattering Japanese machine-gun and small-arms fire to move forward with his platoon leader and another Marine during a determined advance of his company through an isolated sector and, gaining the comparative safety of a shell hole, took temporary cover with his comrades. Immediately pinned down by deadly sniper fire from a well-concealed position, he made several unsuccessful attempts to again move forward and then, joined by his platoon leader, engaged the enemy in a fierce exchange of hand grenades until a Japanese grenade fell in the shell hole. Fearlessly disregarding all personal danger, Private First Class Caddy instantly threw himself upon the deadly missile, absorbing the exploding charge in his own body and protecting the others from serious injury. Stouthearted and indomitable, he unhesitatingly yielded his own life that his fellow Marines might carry on the relentless battle against <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> enemy. His dauntless courage and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflects the highest credit upon Private First Class Caddy and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
25|$|The Scions {{learn of}} the Griffin's plan to capture Baelsar's Wall, the Garlean base {{dividing}} the Black Shroud and occupied Ala Mhigo. Disguised {{as members of the}} Eorzean Alliance, the Griffin's Resistance faction aims to provoke a Garlean counterattack which would force the Alliance into their war. However, under the Griffin's orders, they are killed by Garlean magitek machina. The Griffin, <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> ex-comrade of Raubahn's, employs the prayers and aether of his fallen comrades to summon a massive primal, and augments it with the power of Nidhogg's eyes, which had been carelessly disposed of {{at the end of the}} Dragonsong War. His mad ritual is complete when he sacrifices himself to power the primal's vengeful will—to utterly destroy the Empire. Papalymo, in turn, calls on the same sealing ritual Louisoix used on Bahamut, knowing it would cost his life. His gambit buys time for the Alliance to mount a response to the uncontrollable Calamity-level threat. Nero tol Scaeva, the dishonored Garlean scientist, crashes a strategic meeting with his solution: activating an ancient Allagan primal-hunting weapon known as Omega. Cid reluctantly agrees to assist his former classmate. As they complete the ignition process, the seal bursts open and the dragon-like Shinryu emerges. Wyrm and robot are evenly matched and they seemingly eliminate each other with their final attacks. Cid orders Omega back into stasis, in case it is ever found again. With the seal gone, Papalymo's last remaining spell also fades—an enchanted tattoo used to disguise the one known as Yda. The girl removes her mask and explains that she is actually Yda's sister Lyse. Her ruse was to preserve the memory of her sister who had died fighting in the Resistance. Lyse renews her resolve to fight for Ala Mhigan independence, now under her true name. With Baelsar's Wall captured, the Alliance and the Scions prepare for the Empire's inevitable response.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of measurement reform in France {{was placed in}} the hands of the French Academy of Sciences who appointed a commission chaired by Jean-Charles de Borda. Borda could be said to have been <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> for decimalization: he had designed the repeating circle, a surveying instrument which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in [...] "grades" [...] ( [...] of a quarter-circle) rather than degrees, with 100minutes to a grade and 100seconds to a minute. The instrument was manufactured by Étienne Lenoir. For Borda, the seconds pendulum was a poor choice for a standard because the second (as a unit of time) was insufficiently decimal: he preferred the new system of 10hours to the day, 100minutes to the hour and 100seconds to the minute.|$|E
500|$|Revisionist {{histories}} of the late 20th century have argued {{in favor of a}} more nuanced image of Las Casas, suggesting that he was neither a saint nor <b>a</b> <b>fanatic,</b> but a person with exceptional willpower and a sense of justice, which sometimes led him into arrogance, stubbornness and hypocrisy. Some historians such as [...] argue that he was more of a politician than a humanitarian, and that his liberation policies were always combined with schemes to make colonial extraction of resources from the natives more efficient. He also argues that Las Casas failed to realize that by seeking to replace indigenous spirituality with Christianity, he was undertaking a religious colonialism that was more intrusive than the physical one. This critique has been rejected by other historians as facile and anachronistic.|$|E

500|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} was denounced by many establishment Democrats. [...] President Cleveland, {{stunned by the}} convention's repudiation {{of him and his}} policies, decided against open support for a bolt from the party, either by endorsing McKinley or by publicly backing a rival Democratic ticket. [...] Nevertheless, Gold Democrats began plans to hold their own convention, which took place in September. [...] Many Cleveland supporters decried Bryan as no true Democrat, but <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> and socialist, his nomination procured through demagoguery. [...] Some of the Democratic political machines, such as New York's Tammany Hall, decided to ignore the national ticket and concentrate on electing local and congressional candidates. Large numbers of traditionally Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan, including the New York World, whose circulation of 800,000 was the nation's largest, and major dailies in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit, and Brooklyn. [...] Southern newspapers stayed with Bryan; they were unwilling to endorse McKinley, the choice of most African Americans, though few of them could vote in the South. [...] Newspapers that supported other parties in western silver states, such as the Populist Rocky Mountain News of Denver, Colorado, and Utah's Republican The Salt Lake Tribune, quickly endorsed Bryan.|$|E
500|$|The song {{returned}} to the band's live set for the Joshua Tree Tour 2017, on which the band is performing the album in its entirety. For the tour, prior to performances of [...] "Exit", a clip from the 1950s Western TV series Trackdown is shown; in the clip, a con man named Trump visits a town and promises {{to build a wall}} around them to ensure their safety. The band were pleased when Bono discovered it, as they wanted to make a reference to US President Donald Trump during the show without belabouring their point. The clip is followed by an image of Robert Mitchum's hands tattooed [...] "LOVE" [...] and [...] "HATE" [...] from his acting role as <b>a</b> <b>fanatic</b> preacher and killer in the film The Night of the Hunter. During the performance of [...] "Exit", Bono wears a black suit and preacher hat and adopts the persona of the [...] "Shadow Man".

In 2007, U2's manager Paul McGuinness said that the song had been [...] "slightly tainted" [...] after the trial of Robert John Bardo, speculating that it had fallen out of favour with the band following the incident.|$|E
