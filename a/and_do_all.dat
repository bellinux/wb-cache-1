She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing...

Obeying these commands, says the second portion, will lead to rewards, and disobeying them will lead to punishment. To ensure fulfillment of these key commands, God also commands in the third portion a practical reminder, wearing the tzitzit, [...] "that ye may remember <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> my commandments, and be holy unto your God." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Shabbat, {{according}} to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, [...] "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to {{be a sign}} between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them." [...] The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use. [...] The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, [...] "six days shall you labor <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".|$|E
2500|$|Creation is {{followed}} by rest. In ancient Near Eastern literature the divine rest is achieved in a temple {{as a result of}} having brought order to chaos.

Compare with (...) : [...] "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

2500|$|Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, {{a native}} Ghanaian of Harvard University, says that [...] "tro" [...] means a [...] "god" [...] and [...] "kosi" [...] is used at {{different}} times to mean either [...] "slave", [...] "virgin", or [...] "wife". Anita Ababio, a Ghanaian lawyer who has extensively researched the issue, explains that the Adangbe and Ga word, [...] "woryokwe" [...] comes from [...] "won" [...] meaning cult, and [...] "yokwe", meaning [...] "slave". [...] Thus, she claims, a [...] "woryokwe" [...] is a [...] "slave of a cult". Robert Kwame Amen in Ghana Studies also refers to trokosi as an institution of slavery. [...] Likewise, Stephen Awudi Gadri, President of the Trokosi Abolition Fellowship of Ghana, and also himself from a shrine family, claims that trokosi are [...] "slaves of the deities of the shrines". [...] "Though euphemistically, they are called the 'deity's wives', yet they serve the priests and elders of the shrine <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the hard chores, as well as becoming sexual partners of the priest," [...] Gadri says.

[...] "We lived in a fairly quiet street and we lived right next to the beach [...] so they used to play a fair bit of beach cricket. We used to have a cricket pitch in our backyard which was the driveway and the next-door neighbours had a turf wicket which the boys used to roll and mow <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> that sort of stuff. So he had to learn from an early age I suppose to be a bit stronger and a bit more competitive." [...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club. Paine's uncle, Robert Shaw, was an AFL player and coach.|$|E
2500|$|The Bible {{does not}} command wearing {{of a unique}} prayer shawl or tallit. Instead, it presumes that people wore a garment of some type to cover {{themselves}} and instructs the Children of Israel to attach fringes ( [...] tzitzit) to the corners of these (Numbers 15:38), repeating the commandment in terms that they should [...] "make thee twisted cords upon {{the four corners of}} thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself" [...] (Deuteronomy 22:12). These passages do not specify tying particular types or numbers of knots in the fringes. The exact customs regarding the tying of the tzitzit and the format of the tallit are of post-biblical, rabbinic origin and, though the Talmud discusses these matters, slightly different traditions have developed in different communities. However the Bible is specific as to the purpose of these tzitzit, stating that [...] "it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray; that ye may remember <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> My commandments, and be holy unto your God" [...] (...)
