40|$|Fred Schepisi's The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), a {{story of}} horrific {{violence}} caused by racial oppression, has a controversial place in the Australian social imaginary. As a raw narrative of a part-Aboriginal man's axe-murders of white women, the manhunt which followed, his eventual capture and death by hanging just after Australia achieved federation in 1900, the film was apparently constrained by the limited framework of representation of race relations available in the late 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Audiences</b> were <b>left</b> numbed by {{the image of a}} segregated society, the overpowering murder scenes and the disempowerment and downward spiral of Jimmie and his half brother Mort. Yet it has also been valued as a major film in the Australian new wave cinema and judged as ‘underestimated and overlooked’. This article approaches the film's mixed reception by re-examining it as a screen adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1972), arguing that Schepisi used an expressionist cinematography to convert Keneally's ‘ironic epic’ (Hodge and Mishra 1990 : 59) into a fatalistic tragedy. In reconsidering the film in terms of its era, the article shows how the Australian landscape becomes a site of problematic race relations, overturning the myth of ‘innocent settlement’ that is associated with films of the Australian Film Commission (AFC) genre, heralding post-Mabo films like Rabbit Proof Fence (Noyce, 2002), Ten Canoes (de Heer and Djigirr, 2006) and Jindabyne (Lawrence, 2007) whose stories and mise-en-scène acknowledge earlier traumas, inducing in viewers a belated shock of recognition (Collins and Davis 2004 : 92) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An AG-groupoid is a non-associative groupoid {{in general}} {{in which the}} {{identity}} (ab) c = (cb) a holds. In this paper we study some struc-tural properties of AG-groupoids {{with respect to the}} cancellativity. We prove that cancellative and non-cancellative elements of an AG-groupoid S parti-tion S and the two classes are AG-subgroupoids of S if <b>S</b> has <b>left</b> identity e. Cancellativity and invertibility coincide in a finite AG-groupoid <b>S</b> with <b>left</b> identity e. For a finite AG-groupoid <b>S</b> with <b>left</b> identity e having at least one non-cancellative element, the set of non-cancellative elements form a maximal ideal. We also prove that for an AG-groupoid S, the conditions (i) <b>S</b> is <b>left</b> cancellative (ii) <b>S</b> is right cancellative (iii) S is cancellative, are equivalent...|$|R

40|$|The brain {{activation}} {{of a group}} of high-functioning autistic participants was measured using functional MRI during sentence comprehension and the results compared with those of a Verbal IQ-matched control group. The groups differed in the distribution of activation in two of the key language areas. The autism group produced reliably more activation than the control group in Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> (<b>left</b> laterosuperior temporal) area and reliably less activation than the control group in Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> (<b>left</b> inferior frontal gyrus) area. Furthermore, the functional connectivity, i. e. the degree of synchronization or correlation of the time series of the activation, between the various participating cortical areas was consistently lower for the autistic than the control participants. These findings suggest that the neural basis of disordered language in autism entails a lower degree of information integration and synchronization across the large-scale cortical network for language processing. The article presents a theoretical account of the findings, related to neurobiological foundations of underconnectivity in autism...|$|R
