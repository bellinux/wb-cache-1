Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock and tear down the big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when he should not have been.|$|E

25|$|Abid Rogers Bhatti in {{his book}} A Textbook of Soteriology writes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> metanoia/μετάνοια. In the Urdu Bible, the word for “repentance” is “toba.” Toba means regret, grief, and sorrow over sinful deeds that lead to a change of mind and life. Abid agrees with Tertullian in preferring “conversion” rather than “repentance” to {{translate}} metanoia/μετάνοια in Mark 1:4. In summary, Abid believes that “conversion” (rather than “repentance”) is the best English word to express {{the meaning of the}} Greek metanoia/μετάνοια.|$|E
25|$|Research {{shows that}} religiosity moderates the {{relationship}} between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive. Religiosity has also been found to moderate {{the relationship between}} negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.|$|E

50|$|Archaeologists {{have tried}} {{in recent years}} to {{interpret}} <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ritual artifacts and artistic imagery found at Spiro and other Mississippian sites. While reaching firm conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> works of art made centuries ago by people of an extinct culture is difficult, archaeologists have made some compelling interpretations by comparing Mississippian artistic imagery with the myths, religious rituals, art, and iconography of historic Native American groups.|$|R
25|$|In the film, the {{evolution}} of the human race is traced from prehistory (mankind as blob forms), through today (mankind as teeming crowds of selfish, fighting, or lost individuals), to hundreds of millions of years into the future as our species evolves into countless new forms; all of them still behaving the same way. The film concludes in the extreme future, with two creatures (apparently an adult and child subspecies of future human), having a conversation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> life on a colorful shore.|$|E
25|$|However, Lee recounts that he {{was still}} plagued by {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> human life and the universe, even while on the surface living an ideal life. Thus, in his early thirties he set out to engage in rigorous solo training in the wilderness of Korea's Moak Mountain. to engage in 21 days of ascetic practice and meditation without food, sleep or lying down. He writes that through this training he gained enlightenment and insights that would provide the philosophical underpinnings of his methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{confusion}} in the primary sources <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> Rus has led to arguments between scholars about whether Russia was named after a Scandinavian people or a Slavic people. These are grouped into Normanist and anti-Normanist views (with the broader meaning of Norman, i.e. 'Norse-men'). Current scholarship supports the Normanist argument – that the Rus were a primarily Scandinavian people – {{but there have been}} heated debates in the last century between certain scholars fueled by nationalism. It is now generally accepted that the Rus' were of Scandinavian origin but adopted Slavic cultural characteristics fairly quickly.|$|E

25|$|Changing Times (Les temps qui changent) (2004) is a warmhearted {{exploration}} of cultural collision in contemporary Morocco, oscillating {{between two worlds}} and two ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> experience and the enduring power of love. A middle age construction supervisor comes to Tangier {{to search for the}} love of his youth, lost many years ago. She is now married and with a grown up son. They eventually cross paths in a supermarket. Téchiné weaves together a half dozen subplots, creating a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness.|$|E
25|$|Kryptos is a {{sculpture}} by the American artist Jim Sanborn {{located on the}} grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the four encrypted messages it bears. Of the four messages, the first three have been solved, while the fourth message remains as one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. The sculpture continues to be of interest to cryptanalysts, both amateur and professional, who are attempting to decipher the fourth passage. The artist has so far given two clues to this passage.|$|E
25|$|Opinions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> dreams {{have varied}} and shifted through time and culture. Many endorse the Freudian theory of dreams – that dreams reveal insight into hidden desires and emotions. Other {{prominent}} theories include those suggesting that dreams assist in memory formation, problem solving, or simply are {{a product of}} random brain activation. The earliest recorded dreams were acquired from materials dating back approximately 5000 years, in Mesopotamia, where they were documented on clay tablets. In the Greek and Roman periods, the people believed that dreams were direct messages from deities or deceased persons, and that they predicted the future. Some cultures practiced dream incubation {{with the intention of}} cultivating dreams that are of prophecy.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{broke the}} magazine's longstanding taboo against {{treating}} photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon {{to be its}} first staff photographer.

A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} (and in {{particular}} the right hemisphere) is also involved {{in the formation of}} new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal recognition of an object they had seen in the past, but fail to recollect when or where it had been viewed. Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps organize information for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in executive function. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies semantic strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the study material or rehearsing it in working memory.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 100 years later, ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> {{the battle}} {{have become more}} inclusive. The United States {{government}} acknowledged that Native American sacrifices also deserved recognition at the site. The 1991 bill changing {{the name of the}} national monument also authorized an Indian Memorial to be built near Last Stand Hill in honor of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. The commissioned work by native artist Colleen Cutschall is shown in the photograph at right. On Memorial Day 1999, in consultation with tribal representatives, the U.S. added two red granite markers to the battlefield to note where Native American warriors fell. As of December 2006, a total of ten warrior markers have been added (three at the Reno–Benteen Defense Site and seven on the Little Bighorn Battlefield).|$|E
