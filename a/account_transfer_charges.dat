40|$|Measurements on half-cells {{consisting}} of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte pellets and slurry-coated cathodes of different thickness were performed {{in order to}} determine the active area for oxygen reduction in composite cathodes of lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) and YSZ. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate the main electrochemical parameters of the cathodic process. The temperature range was between 500 and 900 degrees C. The experimental results show a remarkable effect of the electrode thickness on the overall reaction rate in all the temperature range. At 750 degrees C a change in the controlling regime of the oxygen reduction is detectable and has been ascribed to the transition of the rate-determining step from a <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> to a mass transfer of the ionic species.

This study further investigates the impact of surface-functionalization with specifically tailored self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). For the example of three chemically-similar SAMs, that all bond to the ZnO surface via pyridine docking groups, it is shown that the SAMs introduce shallow or deep donor levels that pin the band bending at the position of the SAM's highest occupied molecular orbital. In this way, the magnitude of the induced band bending can be controlled by the type of SAM, to a point where the doping-concentration dependence is completely eliminated...|$|R

The CM 4 M partial atomic charges in neutral and ionic solutes {{and in the}} corresponding clustered solutes (supersolutes), which included one solute molecule {{and one or two}} solvent molecules, were modeled in three solvents (benzene, methylene chloride, and water) and compared to those in the gas phase. The use of the supersolute approach (microsolvation) allows one to <b>account</b> for <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> from the solute to the solvent, and we find <b>charge</b> <b>transfers</b> as large as 0. 06 atomic units for neutral solutes (pyridine in water) and 0. 32 atomic units for ions (methoxide anion in water). Relaxation of the electronic structure of the solute in the presence of solvent increases the polarization free energy of the neutral solutes studied here, on average, by 16 % in benzene, 30 % in methylene chloride, and 43 % in water.

40|$|A new {{formalism}} {{has been}} developed in order to evaluate intermolecular interaction energies for inorganic and organometallic complexes {{in the framework of}} the extended Hückel method. In order to provide the shortest possible response time on an interactive computer graphics facility, this model should require the minimum amount of computer time, which explains why approximate procedures are used to evaluate electrostatic, <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> and exchange repulsion components. When applying this model to typical examples of electrophilic addition reactions to organometallic complexes, it is found that it is essential to take <b>account</b> of <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> interactions, the electrostatic component alone being not sufficient, even qualitatively, for a proper description of the reaction mechanism.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{confined}} systems, such as substrate-supported incommensurate layers, are {{of interest}} because their structural and electronic properties may {{differ from those of}} bulk materials. While advances in experimental techniques have resulted in the growth of many such interesting systems, progress can often be hampered by the lack of an atomistic-scale understanding of the structure, especially for incommensurate systems. In this work, we develop an atomic-scale model for an ordered incommensurate gold-sulfide (AuS) adlayer that has been previously demonstrated to exist on the Au(111) surface, following sulfur deposition and annealing to 450 K. We introduce theoretical techniques within density functional theory to take into <b>account</b> <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> in an incommensurate system and model scanning tunneling microscopy images, which are in good agreement with experiment. Our simulations indicate that this model is remarkably robust. We analyze the nature of bonding in this structure using state-of-the-art Wannier-function based techniques. Our analysis provides a natural explanation for the extraordinary robustness and unusual stoichiometry of this layer.

40|$|Tribolectric {{charging}} {{results from}} contact between surfaces, but precisely {{what is meant}} by each is not defined or understood, as they relate to charging. The recent microscopic evidence that contact charging can result from material transfer provides incentive to examine how contact charging is affected by these two factors. It is suggested that vigorous rubbing or pressing of two polymers results in transfer of deeper layers than would result from light contacts. Different layers can have substantially different compositions because polymers are typically not homogeneous as a function of depth, so contact and surface are related in this way. This could <b>account</b> for <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> between identical polymers, especially in asymmetric contacts in which the frictional force on one polymer differs from that on the other, so that material from different depths is transferred. This review outlines the roles of physics, chemistry and surface analysis in sufficient detail to focus on these subjects.

The experimental results show that the oxygen reaction is not under activation control at low temperatures, and other phenomena, such as the transfer of oxygen ions to and through the solid electrolyte in the composite cathode, occur and retard the overall rate of oxygen reduction. This working hypothesis was assessed using a simplified theoretical model of the cathode that <b>accounts</b> for <b>charge</b> <b>transfer</b> mass transfer and conduction. The model simulations compared satisfactorily with the experimental data, and they show that, at low temperatures, the reaction zone in the cathode is confined to the electrolyte interface.
