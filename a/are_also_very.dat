5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or they die. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Levels of {{unemployment}} in Felling are high. Only 52.4% {{of the total}} working age population are in employment, as compared to 61.7% in the borough overall. Around 10% of residents claim Jobseeker's Allowance; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough. Youth unemployment levels <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> high at 14%, which compares to a borough average of 9% and is also the highest figure in Gateshead. The average income of residents is only £18,000 per annum; this compares to a Gateshead average of £27,000 and is the lowest figure in the borough.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} popular forms of meal in Ahmedabad is a typical Gujarati thali which was first served commercially by Chandvilas Hotel in 1900. It {{consists}} of roti (Chapati), dal, rice and shaak (cooked vegetables, sometimes with curry), with accompaniments of pickles and roasted papads. Sweet dishes include laddoo, mango, and vedhmi. Dhoklas, theplas and dhebras <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> popular dishes in Ahmedabad. Beverages include buttermilk and tea. Drinking alcohol is forbidden in Ahmedabad.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} rock is dacite, rich in potassium. The rocks have a porphyric {{appearance and}} contain few vesicles. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> rich in crystals, {{with the dominant}} phenocryst-forming minerals being biotite, hornblende and plagioclase. Less important are allanite, apatite, clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene, quartz, sphene and zircon. The groundmass contains plagioclase, pyroxene, silicon dioxide and oxides of iron and titanium. The composition of Ciomadul's rocks has been fairly constant throughout its evolution, and this diversity of its components indicate that the genesis of Ciomadul magmas involved mixing between felsic and mafic magma.|$|E
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. The diets of wild slow lorises are poorly understood. Signs of an inappropriate diet in captivity include tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are often sleeping when the nocturnal pet is normally awake.|$|E
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E

5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>very</b> small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
