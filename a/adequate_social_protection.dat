Following, the rights of seasonal workers will be embedded in an international human rights framework, explaining which international binding legal obligations in relation to social security and work-related rights exist.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of an economy}} to the global market, even when it leads {{to a higher standard}} of living, usually results in economic uncertainties, as well as eroding social values and traditions of the society. Some people may gain, while some others may lose out from it, which may couse distributive conflicts to emerge. The economic uncertainties and insecurity, as well as the distributive conflicts that arise from globalisation, could disrupt the economy from securing the bebefits of globalisation, and consequently could pose an impediment to economic growth. Hence, some scholars has argued that globalisation also increases the demand for greater role of government to stabilise the economy in terms of providing <b>adequate</b> <b>social</b> <b>protection,</b> if the benefits from globalisation are to be realised. This paper attempts to examine the impact of globalisation on the welfare of the Malaysian society, particularly on unemployment and poverty, and discusses the issues and challenges with regards to the provision of social protection in Malaysia.

30|$|Little {{is known}} about the lives of older {{dependent}} people in LMICs and the effects of the older person’s health and social care needs upon the households in which they live. Evidence from our recent cross-sectional survey in Nigeria suggested that although the only recourse for older dependent people was to live with or to be directly provided for by their family, families were not always in a position be able to ensure <b>adequate</b> <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> (Acosta et al. 2010). Findings from this and other 10 / 66 sites suggested that caregiving may be associated with adverse economic impacts upon the household, including increased healthcare expenditure and the caregiver (usually female) cutting back on paid work in order to care (Acosta et al. 2008, 2010; Liu et al. 2009; Uwakwe et al. 2009). The increased global health focus on chronic disease is mainly concerned with preventing cardiovascular and cancer mortality (Yach et al. 2004; Beaglehole et al. 2008), rather than addressing the long-term consequences of other disorders more associated with disability and dependence(Prince et al. 2008; Sousa et al. 2009, 2010).

Mostly, they have been {{regarded}} as positive developments, specifically from the viewpoint of their potential for enhancing the employment of the Dutch labour force and for promoting the emancipation and economic self-sufficiency of women. Dutch governments haverecognized, however, that for taking full profit of such benefits flexibilisation has tobe regulated. Which means, not in the least, that flexible workers have to have an <b>adequate</b> <b>social</b> <b>protection.</b> In line with this thinking, policies have been guided by the aspiration of combining flexibility and security. Or to achieve adequate flexicurity as the combination of goals has come to be known. In this chapter the editor will present and discuss critically Dutch flexicurity policies ofrecent years, which have mainly been taken in the fields of part-time work, socialsecurity, labour law, and work-care combination. To put matters into perspective he will start with presenting figures about developmentsin the extent and distribution of flexible work and of part-time work. In main lines it will show that in the Netherlands the degree of flexible work is rathermodest, while the degree of part-time work is very high. Thirdly, he will discuss the development in Dutch government’s flexicurity policies, and describe the aims and content of recent measures. Since collective labour agreements between social partnersare an important part of workers' flexicurity he should also discuss developmentsin this field separately, but space restrictions do not allow this.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ability of public works {{programmes}} (PWPs) to promote employment and reduce poverty. Public works are {{a key component of}} the current social protection framework in South Africa, constituting the only significant form of social support for the able-bodied working age unemployed, and are ascribed considerable potential in terms of addressing the central challenges of unemployment and poverty. Despite this policy prominence, the targeting of public works programmes and their micro-economic and labour market impacts have not been studied systematically in South Africa, rendering evidence-based policy development in this area problematic. This paper attempts to provide some initial responses to these questions in order to establish an evidence base for future policy development, and to identify some of the key policy lessons arising, drawing evidence from two case studies, the Gundo Lashu programme in Limpopo, and the Zibambele programme in KwaZulu Natal. The paper also reviews the policy context, and the characterisation of the unemployment problem in the policy discourse. The paper concludes that while PWPs can offer a partial response to the problems of poverty and unemployment if appropriately designed, the gap between policy expectation and programme reality is significant, and that PWPs cannot offer an <b>adequate</b> <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> response to the growing problem of the working age poor. The paper asserts {{that there is a need}} to recognise that PWPs can have only a limited role in the context of entrenched and structural unemployment, and that supply-side interventions are of limited value in response to poverty and unemployment among the low-skilled, given ongoing structural shifts in the South African economy and the delinking of economic growth and employment. ...|$|E
40|$|With rapid aging, many of {{the elderly}} suffer from poverty and high {{healthcare}} needs.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to show older population 2 ̆ 7 s condition of disability and poverty, to evaluate the impact of NBLSS on health services utilization, and to examine the differential effect of the NBLSS by disability status among the elderly. This study used the Korea Welfare Panel Study data 2005 – 2014 with the final sample of 40, 365, who were 65 years and older. The participants were divided into people with mild disability, severe disability, and without disability according to the Korean disability registration system. The income-level was defined to the low-income with NBLSS, the low-income without NBLSS, and the middle and high income, using the relative poverty line as a proxy of the low-income. The dependent variables were the number of outpatient visits and inpatient days, experience of home care services, total healthcare expenditure, and financial burden of healthcare expenditure. We performed Generalized Estimating Equations population-averaged model using the ten years of panel data. The result showed that within the same disability status, the low-income without NBLSS group used the least amount of inpatient care, but their financial burden of health expenditure was the highest among the three income groups. The regression model showed that if the elderly with severe disability were in the low-income without NBLSS, they reduced the outpatient and inpatient days; but their financial burden of healthcare became intensified. This study shows that the low-income elderly with disability but without <b>adequate</b> <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> are the most disadvantaged group.

30|$|Still, {{there are}} {{considerable}} challenges regarding the politico-economic feasibility of such reforms. First, political preferences matter. If segmentation is addressed though reducing the social rights of ‘insiders’, {{it can be}} difficult to organize democratic majorities for such proposals. EPL is a case in point, whereby it is unsurprising that deregulation only took place under severe reform pressure. Moreover, expanding social protection for vulnerable workers could be met with resistance from the majority with a low unemployment risk (the net payers) owing to the considerable costs of such reforms. However, it also should be noted that the political economy literature greatly exaggerates the extent to which public opinion is divided between insiders and outsiders. There is considerable solidarity across the insider–outsider divide (Marx 2015), to which policy-makers can appeal, in particular in hard times. Second, the macro economy and budget constraints play a crucial role. In some countries there simply seems to be insufficient labor demand to offer secure jobs to the entire workforce. In a context of high unemployment and economic uncertainty, it is understandable if workers and policy-makers view temporary employment as the lesser of two evils. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that that (political and economic) room for stimulating the economy is very limited in the context of the European debt crisis. Apart from EPL and industrial relation reforms, substantially improving the situation of the unemployed and temporary workers costs money: in the form of training for those with insufficient skills, wage subsidies, decent jobs in the public sector and <b>adequate</b> <b>social</b> <b>protection</b> (against unemployment and in old age). Needless to say, funding such reforms is particularly challenging in times of austerity. Policy-makers will have to look for ways to make employers contribute to the social costs of their hiring practices, without making temporary contracts so expensive that hiring is discouraged. This could also be an issue for EU level policies.|$|E
