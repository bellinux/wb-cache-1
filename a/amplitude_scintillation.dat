Out {{of a total of}} 480 scintillation events recorded during 2010, 84. 4 % were weak (0. 2 ≤ S 4 < 0. 3), 14. 6 % moderate (0. 3 ≤ S 4 < 0. 45) and only 1 % strong (0. 45 ≤ S 4). The <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillations</b> were most pronounced in the local daytime with January registering the highest occurrence. Seasonal analysis revealed maximum scintillation occurrence during summer as compared to winter and equinox seasons. The daytime scintillation with a maximum in the summer is consistent with localized blanketing sporadic E observations and could also be possibly due to lightning activity around the observing station. Annual percentage occurrence shows that scintillations occurred mostly in the daytime with peak occurrence at around 05 : 00 – 09 : 00 LT. The daytime strong scintillation events were not associated with vTEC depletions and phase scintillations, but the signal to noise ratio during the scintillation events decreased with increase in scintillation index (S 4). However, the post-midnight strong <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillations</b> were associated with vTEC depletions and phase scintillations indicative of large scale irregularities (spread-F).

During the prestorm quiet nights, scintillations are occurring postsunset, as expected; however, during the storm time period, their spatial-temporal characteristics and intensity modify significantly owing to the {{dramatic changes in the}} ionospheric plasma density distribution and in the temporal evolution of TEC. The two-dimensional maps showing both TEC and <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillations</b> revealed strong evidence of turbulences at the Fresnel length (causing scintillations) concurrent with those regions of steepest TEC gradients adjacent to the crests of the EIA. The largest density gradients have been found to occur in an environment of increased background electron density, and their spatial distribution and location during the disturbed period may differ significantly from the magnetic quiet night pattern. However, in terms of magnitude the gradients at equatorial and low latitudes appear to not change during both magnetic quiet and disturbed conditions.

The level of <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillation</b> as indexed by S 4 was very low at less than 0.1 throughout most of the interval, even after the onset of the expansion phase. This is in good agreement with an earlier finding of Spogli et al.

Post-midnight scintillation occurred during the June solstice, although the intensity was weak. The intensity of the scintillation observed at the station near the magnetic equator was especially weaker than that observed in the crest region of the equatorial anomaly. This latitudinal variation is also interpreted from the perspective that {{the intensity of the}} <b>amplitude</b> <b>scintillation</b> is proportional to the amplitude of the plasma density perturbations. The difference between the scintillation occurrences in Asian and African regions may be related to a longitudinal dependence, as shown by satellite observations (Dao et al. 2011; Yizengaw et al. 2013). As Yizengaw et al. (2013) have shown, the post-midnight plasma irregularities in the American and African sectors extend to higher altitudes compared with those in the other longitudinal sectors. Such longitudinal differences may be responsible for why post-midnight GPS scintillation was observed in Africa but not in Asia.|$|E
