5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the <b>array</b> with the target value.

5|$|If {{the target}} value {{is greater than}} the {{greatest}} value in the <b>array,</b> and the last index of the <b>array</b> is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow.

If the <b>array</b> must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the <b>array</b> also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E

30|$|Silicon {{nanowire}} (SiNW) <b>arrays</b> demonstrate considerable {{promise as}} an absorber layer for solar cells {{because of their}} advantages such as quantum size effect [1] and strong optical confinement [2 – 6]. Many researchers have investigated the optical properties of SiNW <b>arrays</b> fabricated by {{several methods such as}} metal-assisted chemical etching (MAE) [7 – 9], vapor–liquid-solid method [10], laser ablation [11], thermal evaporation [12], and reactive ion etching [13]. Some researchers have reported the control of diameter and density of SiNW <b>arrays</b> using self-assembled close-packed 2 -D <b>arrays</b> of nano/microparticle <b>arrays</b> or nanopatterns, and so on. Recently, SiNW solar cells have been extensively investigated for the utilization of their optical confinement [14 – 16] properties. Vertically aligned SiNW <b>arrays</b> exhibit low reflection and strong absorption [5] and can be used in antireflection coatings or as the active layer in solar cells [17, 18]. The optical properties of such <b>arrays</b> investigated thus far have included the influence of silicon substrates. The optical properties of vertically aligned SiNW <b>arrays</b> have been theoretically evaluated by several researchers [3, 4, 19]. On the other hand, Bao et al. reported that SiNW <b>arrays</b> with random diameter show significant absorption enhancement [19]. According to this paper, we focused on SiNW <b>arrays</b> fabricated by the MAE method to enhance absorption in SiNW <b>arrays</b> with random diameter. To apply these <b>arrays</b> to large-area solar cells, many researchers have adopted SiNW <b>arrays</b> by MAE method, and SiNW <b>arrays</b> prepared by the MAE method tend to have nanowires with a broad range of diameters and may contain bundles of nanowires that adhere to each other due to the wet etching process [7]. Although the optical properties of SiNW <b>arrays</b> have been reported, their light-scattering properties have been scarcely investigated. It is essential to investigate the light-scattering properties of SiNW <b>arrays</b> in order to understand their high optical confinement. In this study, we have investigated the optical properties of SiNW <b>arrays</b> prepared by MAE. Since the SiNW <b>arrays</b> prepared by this method are deposited on silicon substrates, it is difficult to measure the optical properties of SiNW <b>arrays</b> in isolation from the substrate. To remove the effect of the substrate, the SiNW <b>arrays</b> were peeled from the substrate. We present experimentally determined angular distribution functions (ADFs) [20] of the transmittance of SiNW <b>arrays</b> composed of SiNWs of different lengths. The effects of light scattering were also investigated.|$|R
