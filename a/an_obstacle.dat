5|$|The robot {{has several}} {{possible}} responses to any obstacles. These {{will depend on}} its environment (navigation corridor, tarmac area without many obstacles, cluttered indoor environment etc.) {{at the time of}} the encounter with <b>an</b> <b>obstacle.</b> It can stop and wait for a gap in traffic, or avoid <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> by using a technique based on a spiral, or perform path planning trajectories.|$|E
5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to a Soviet {{takeover}} of Poland. Consequently, {{over the course of}} the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|In addition, without , a {{wheeled vehicle}} can become stuck {{on top of}} <b>an</b> <b>{{obstacle}},</b> with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground. Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are {{equipped to deal with}} uneven terrain.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{reactive}} local navigation system is presented, for an autonomous non-holonomic mobile robot navigating in dynamic environments. The reactive navigation system integrates <b>a</b> <b>obstacle</b> detection method [3] {{and a new}} reactive collision avoidance method. The sensory perception is based in a laser range finder (LRF) system. Simulation results are presented to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed local navigation system in unknown environments with multiple moving objects. The comparison of results are shown, between two different approaches, <b>a</b> Velocity <b>Obstacle</b> (VO) approach and our own, based in the Dynamic Window (DW) concept...|$|R
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the Greeks and Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting barrier between the Latin world {{and both the}} Islamic and Orthodox religions. It was <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to the reunification of the Christian church and created a perception of Westerners as defeated aggressors.|$|E
5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley to run <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> course. Results {{were not}} satisfactory, as such objects would catch and stretch out the fur {{due to the}} extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur would go through the objects.|$|E
5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act as <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
40|$|We {{simulate}} quasistatic {{flows of}} an ideal two-dimensional monodisperse foam around different obstacles, both symmetric and asymmetric, in a channel. We record both pressure and network contributions to the drag and lift forces, and study them as <b>a</b> function of <b>obstacle</b> geometry. We show that the drag force increases linearly with the cross section of <b>an</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The lift on an asymmetric aerofoil-like shape is negative and increases with its arc length, mainly due to the pressure contribution...|$|R

5|$|During the War of 1812, Presque Isle {{played a}} part in the victory over the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry, {{commander}} of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay as a place to construct six of the nine ships in his fleet. Using this location protected the men by creating <b>an</b> <b>obstacle,</b> forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.|$|E
5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to Grant's ambitions.|$|E

5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to surgery.|$|E
5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E
5|$|European Union law (EU law) has {{prescribed}} {{the structure}} of and relationships between all European cattle herd books since 1977. However, {{it was not until}} 2007 that the French Limousin Herd Book began a process of restructuring to comply with relevant EU regulations, directives and decisions. EU law affecting stud cattle breeding in Europe derives principally from an EU objective to achieve free movement of goods between member countries, and to address farmer and consumer protectionist and interventionist actions that oppose the principles of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E

5|$|In 1427, Stefan's {{successor}} Đurađ Branković had {{to return}} Belgrade to the Hungarian king, and Smederevo became the new capital. Although the Ottomans captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as Nándorfehérvár in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, Rupert {{appears to}} have been {{involved}} in a plot to assassinate Oliver Cromwell, an event that would then have been followed by a coup, the landing of a small army in Sussex, and the restoration of Charles II. Charles himself is understood to have rejected the assassination proposal, but three conspirators—who implicated Rupert in the plan—were arrested and confessed in London. Rupert's presence at the royal court continued to be problematic; as in 1643, he was regarded by Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and others as a bellicose figure and <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> to peace negotiations; in 1655 Rupert left for Germany.|$|E
