Prominences are usually not found in active regions until they are about 4 days old. After this time, the number of prominences appears to be a function of the large-scale complexities in the magnetic field pattern whether these are a result of emerging flux, the merging of adjacent <b>active</b> <b>centers,</b> or the coalescing of remnant fields of <b>active</b> <b>centers.</b> Prominences may disappear by the slow or rapid flow of mass into the chromosphere or by the more violent eruptives.

25|$|Transcription {{fidelity}} {{is achieved}} through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding {{base in the}} DNA is admitted to the <b>active</b> <b>center.</b> RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing. The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation. Note that all reactions (phosphodiester bond synthesis, pyrophosphorolysis, phosphodiester bond hydrolysis) are performed by RNA polymerase by using a single <b>active</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

It was an <b>active</b> <b>center</b> for Buddhist religious activities, and was also inhabited at the time. The age of the site was determined by the carbon dating of artifacts discovered during excavation. The sculptural panels in the site are of the Amaravati school which also suggests that the site was built between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE. The Chandavaram Buddhist site was used as a resting place by Buddhist monks traveling from Kashi to Kanchi. Discovered in 1964, the site was constructed during the Satavahana dynasty. Ayaka pillars are absent from the site, indicating that the Hinayana form of Buddhism was prevalent in Chandavaram. The site houses a double terraced MahaStupa on a hilltop which is next in importance only to Sanchi Stupa. The hill on which the MahaStupa is located is called Singarakonda.|$|E

2500|$|As noted above, RNA {{polymerase}} makes {{contacts with}} the promoter region. [...] However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. [...] Once the open complex is stabilized, RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA strand to establish a DNA-RNA heteroduplex (~8-9 bp) at the <b>active</b> <b>center,</b> which stabilizes the elongation complex. [...] In order to accomplish RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [...] "scrunching" [...] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex. During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a [...] "stressed intermediate." [...] Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. [...] Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough, RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. However, promoter escape {{is not the only}} outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription. [...] The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [...] Scientists have coined the term [...] "abortive initiation" [...] to explain the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition. [...] The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.|$|E
