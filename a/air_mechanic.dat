5|$|On 9 July 1918 McCudden {{was killed}} in a flying {{accident}} when his aircraft crashed following an engine fault. His rank {{at the time of his}} death was major, a significant achievement for a man who had begun his career in the RFC as an <b>air</b> <b>mechanic.</b> McCudden is buried at the British war cemetery at Beauvoir-Wavans.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1913 he {{was posted}} to No. 3 Squadron RFC. He managed a flight in a Blériot {{aircraft}} while there and gradually won {{a reputation as}} a first-rate mechanic. By Christmas his frequent requests for trips in the aircraft had met with so much success that McCudden had logged nearly 30 hours, mostly in the Blériot monoplanes. On 1 April 1914 he was promoted to <b>Air</b> <b>Mechanic</b> First Class.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{wanted to}} join the war effort in August 1914 as a {{despatch}} rider, but his critically ill mother managed {{to persuade him to}} stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an <b>Air</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.|$|E

5|$|King {{transferred}} to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 13January 1917, and was posted to Britain to join No.4 Squadron AFC (also referred to as No.71 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, by the British) as an <b>air</b> <b>mechanic</b> on 18April. He was assigned to a training squadron for flying instruction in August. On 15October, he gained his wings and officer's commission. Allocated to No.4 Squadron in November 1917, King was posted to France for active duty on 21March 1918. The same day, the Germans launched Operation Michael, the opening phase of the Spring Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Around mid-September 1943, the two-man Bf 110 {{crew was}} {{augmented}} {{by a third}} member, {{sometimes referred to as}} Bordmechaniker (<b>air</b> <b>mechanic)</b> or Bordschütze (air gunner). The reason for this was that the decline of the Himmelbett procedure, the introduction of the broadcast procedure Zahme Sau, and the growing threat of RAF intruder night fighter operations, had necessitated the need for another pair of watchful eyes to the rear. Unteroffizier Wilhelm Gänsler, who had already contributed to 17 claims made by Hauptmann Ludwig Becker, was Schnaufer's new lookout. With Handtke and Gänsler as his crew, Schnaufer claimed his 26th aerial victory on 23 September 1943 over a No. 218 Squadron Stirling during a Wilde Sau intercept mission.|$|E
5|$|Born on 24 March 1895 at Leongatha, Victoria, Mackinolty {{was the son}} of {{labourer}} James Mickleburg Mackinolty and {{his wife}} Mary. He went to public schools, obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in Melbourne. Commencing his working life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World WarI. His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an <b>air</b> <b>mechanic</b> with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook. He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to sergeant and given command of the school's woodworking team.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an <b>air</b> <b>mechanic</b> and after {{training}} was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, Allingham, by then an <b>Air</b> <b>Mechanic</b> First Class, {{was posted}} to the Western Front to join No. 12 Squadron RNAS. This unit {{acted as a}} {{training}} squadron for other RNAS squadrons based on the Western Front. There is also some evidence that the squadron was involved in combat operations. When Allingham arrived at Petite-Synthe, both the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the RNAS {{were involved in the}} Ypres offensive. Allingham also instrumented the very first reconnaissance aircraft camera during the First World War. On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France where he remained {{for the rest of the}} war, on aircraft repair and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, Baker {{followed}} his ambition {{of joining the}} Australian Flying Corps and applied for a transfer to become an <b>air</b> <b>mechanic</b> when the opportunity arose. His application proved successful, though he was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training. Embarking for the United Kingdom the following month, he was posted to No. 5 Training Squadron as a cadet pilot for his initial aviation instruction. On 27 March, Baker graduated as a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant; he had completed his first solo flight earlier that month. In May, he was posted for a course at No. 2 School of Aerial Fighting and Gunnery.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{was born}} 17November 1891 in Kew, {{a suburb of}} Melbourne, to joiner and {{engineer}} Charles Hubert Murphy and his wife Mary. Educated at Melbourne High School and Footscray Technical School, he spent five years with Austral Otis Engineering as an apprentice. Having been employed at various engineering firms, Murphy joined the Australian Army's Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School Point Cook in 1914 to train as an <b>air</b> <b>mechanic.</b> By February 1916, he had risen {{to the rank of}} sergeant and volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force to serve overseas. Transferring to the Australian Flying Corps, Murphy was allocated to No.1 Squadron—also known until 1918 as No.67 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC)—as a warrant officer. He departed Melbourne aboard HMAT A67 Orsova on 16March, bound for Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately {{his desire}} to be a pilot was postponed. The family {{required}} further income after his father retired. Unable to wait for that opportunity to arise he joined the Royal Engineers on 26 April 1910, as No. 20083. On 24 February 1911 he set sail for Gibraltar on the southern tip of Spain. McCudden spent eighteen months in Gibraltar before returning to England in September 1912. While in Gibraltar he read Flight manual magazine habitually, which explained the theory of flight, aircraft construction and aero engines. He excelled in his service and by 26 April 1913 he had become a qualified Sapper. He also held the grade <b>Air</b> <b>Mechanic</b> 2nd Class, No. 892, which was awarded to him on 28 April 1913. Soon afterwards he {{became a member of the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 9 May he was posted to Farnborough depot as a mechanic.|$|E

In 1918 the RNAS was merged with the Royal Flying Corps and Hardinge transferred again to the newly formed Royal Air Force with the rank of Sergeant Major, first with the Cadet Brigade headquarters at Hastings {{and then at the}} Armament School. He transferred to the RAF Reserve in January 1919 and was discharged in 1920.|$|E

500|$|Frank was {{assigned}} Junkers Ju 88 (Werknummer 751 095—factory number) on 17 April 1944. He never flew this aircraft operationally.

500|$|McCudden {{brought his}} {{substantial}} technical knowledge to 56 Squadron. He frequently inspected his flight's aircraft, expecting {{a high standard}} of mechanical refinement. He believed the finer the aircraft could be tuned the less likelihood there would be of losing pilots to structural or mechanical failures, which at that time were the cause of many fatalities among aircrew. Force-landings were rarely fatal owing to the low-landing speeds but the prospect of coming down behind enemy lines—especially since the RFC was adopting an offensive stance—was an undesirable prospect.
