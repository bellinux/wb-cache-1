She {{is a friend of}} the couple's 25-year-old daughter Yazareth Liz Abarca Pineda, who was taken into custody along with her parents. However, Yazareth was only considered an eye-witness and does not face criminal charges.

25|$|As a result, Interpol, the {{international}} law enforcement agency, issued a light blue notice against Modi {{to be arrested}} on Indian soil. However, in June 2015, and despite the Interpol notice, Modi took <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> ex-Interpol Chief Ronald Noble and uploaded it to his Instagram account while attending the El Clasico match in Barcelona. In the post, he referred to Noble as his “brother”. The incident caused significant media backlash within India as many began to {{raise questions about the}} connection between men with criminal reputations like Modi and international law enforcement. Yet Noble, who served as the head of Interpol from 2000 to 2014, denied any knowledge of Modi's criminal activities despite evidence that Modi was on an Interpol watch list for some time.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie and Jack {{decide to}} move to Ongar, Essex, to Roxy's displeasure as Amy would be moving with them, though Ronnie then {{suggests}} that Roxy move to a nearby house in the same town. Roxy suspects that Jack and Honey are having an affair and tells Ronnie, who confronts Jack. He denies this and later, Roxy decides Amy should move without her and then asks Ronnie to adopt Amy. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees but later the sisters secretly plan for Roxy to join the couple in Essex. However, on her wedding day, Roxy packs her things as she reveals she is moving away to live with Glenda and Danny, feeling as if she will ruin Ronnie's happiness. After an argument, Ronnie convinces Roxy to give her away, and she agrees. While {{on the way to}} the wedding, Ronnie and Roxy visit Phil for a final time and take <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> him, unbeknownst to him that it'll be the last time he'll see them. At the wedding, Roxy begins to break down and says she cannot give Ronnie away and runs out. Ronnie is unable to face Jack and runs off in tears, later revealing she wishes Roxy to move with them and will not accept any other outcome. Jack eventually accepts and they marry after Roxy gives her away. Later, the two sisters get drunk after a happy day and wander outside the hotel; precariously perched on the hotel roof, still drinking champagne, they discuss their time in the square and the start of a new era. Ronnie and Roxy find the hotel swimming pool, and Roxy jumps in. Ronnie is unable to remove her wedding dress and sees Roxy motionless at the bottom of the pool. Ronnie jumps in to rescue her, but is weighed down by her wedding dress and drowns alongside her sister. The following morning, police find their bodies in the pool and inform Jack's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood), who then breaks the news to a devastated Jack. A few days later, Jack receives their wedding video and watches Ronnie saying how much she loves him, and is emotional watching it. Jack later visits her body in the chapel of rest a day before her and Roxy's funerals and says an emotional farewell to her. At the inquest into Ronnie and Roxy's deaths, their deaths are ruled as misadventure.|$|E

500|$|Photographer Annie Leibovitz {{went to the}} Lennons' {{apartment}} to do a photo shoot for Rolling Stone magazine. Leibovitz promised Lennon that a photo with Ono would make the front cover of the magazine, even though she initially tried to get <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> Lennon by himself. Leibovitz said, [...] "Nobody wanted [...] on the cover". Lennon insisted that both {{he and his wife}} be on the cover, and after taking the pictures, Leibovitz left their apartment at 3:30p.m. After the photo shoot, Lennon gave what would be his last interview, to San Francisco DJ Dave Sholin, for a music show to be broadcast on the RKO Radio Network. At 5:40p.m., Lennon and Ono, delayed by a late limousine, left their {{apartment to}} mix the song [...] "Walking on Thin Ice" [...] (an Ono song featuring Lennon on lead guitar) at the Record Plant Studio.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Materia Generation System" [...] allows {{players to}} acquire Materia, objects {{tied to the}} game's magic system, by taking <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> their camera phone. The game synthesizes the picture down to its base color. Depending upon the {{dominant}} color, lighting, and other factors, the game produces a Materia of a certain type. For example, a dark green picture results in a Bio Materia, while a blue picture results in a Cure Materia. Once acquired, Materia can be leveled up as in Final Fantasy VII. Under certain circumstances, assistance {{in the form of}} summoned monsters, recurring figures in the Final Fantasy series, can be called in via the Materia system to deal damage to multiple enemies. Rank Points are awarded during the completion of objectives in all three modes of play. After a certain amount of Rank Points have been acquired, special bonuses are unlocked, such as stronger armor and weapons, and extra Materia slots. The player is also given a rank, based upon how long they have been playing the game. The higher their rank, the better the bonuses the player gets.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2002, Hoffman starred {{opposite}} Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson's {{critically acclaimed}} fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama Punch-Drunk Love (2002), {{where he played}} an illegal phone-sex [...] "supervisor". Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader saw the performance as {{a fine example of}} Hoffman's [...] "knack for turning small roles into seminal performances", and praised the actor's comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with Anthony Hopkins in the high-budget thriller Red Dragon, a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee's drama 25th Hour, playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film's lead Edward Norton were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> the actor, but had waited until he found the right role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, {{to be one of the}} most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced [...] "corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy." [...] Roger Ebert promoted 25th Hour to one of his [...] "Great Movies" [...] in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s.|$|E

500|$|Honey pays {{homage to}} some of Nagai's other creations, such as the Mazinger and Devilman series; the first two episodes alone include many cameos. [...] The first shows Mayor Light and Chokkei in <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>with</b> {{characters}} from Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen, Iyahaya Nantomo, and Oira Sukeban, while Devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle. In the second, a scene in a downtown market in Cosplay City has cameos from Hige Godzilla from Harenchi Gakuen and Naojiro Abashiri from The Abashiri Family; a scene in Honey's bedroom shows a bust of Mazinger Z and a framed picture of her father, Dr. Kisaragi; and several scenes show Mazinger Z Sayaka Yumi, The Abashiri Family Kikunosuke, and an unnamed character from Kekkō Kamen as they get turned into plastic-coated statues. Cutie Honey's skin-tight, full-body costume uses the same design and tricolor (blue, black, and red) scheme as that of Nagai's original manga, but its chest opening—with rounded side edges—resembles the one in her 1973 anime attire. The opening sequence used {{in the first four}} episodes shows versions of Honey's original seven forms in the TV series: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's techniques parody those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later episodes feature appearances by Akira Fudo of Devilman and Professor Kabuto of Mazinger Z. In episode 7, Honey transforms herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title sequence of episodes 5 through 8 features Sirene, Devilman's nemesis, and Akira Fudo of Devilman along with Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto. Devilman can be briefly seen as one of the back-up guitarists for the one-time antagonist Saline in episode 3.|$|E
