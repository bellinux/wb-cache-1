5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was most likely a simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used {{at a number of}} public ceremonies—including at the proclamation of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E
5|$|During the Visigoths {{period the}} burials, as noted from the archeological finds, were near the Picuriña, Pardaleras, and Cerro de Reyes sites.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hunt for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Radicals such as Sir Francis Burdett {{believed}} that Magna Carta {{could not be}} repealed, but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4 c. 31 s. 1), {{was the first time}} a clause of Magna Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was repealed, leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, and in modern Northern Ireland <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Yunnan hare {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it has been reported by residents to be commonly found. Although the current state of its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to be secure as it occurs in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions may pose a threat to the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. It occurs in protected areas <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.|$|E

5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} Fiji, {{where it is}} found on the four largest islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Kadavu) <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smaller western islands of the Mamanuca and the Yasawa groups. It is {{uncommon}} but widespread, found in both forested and open habitats, from sea level to at least 1,200m (3,900ft) on Viti Levu. It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands. It has adapted well to man-made habitats, and is seen in grasslands, pasture, rice paddies, parks and gardens. Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds, but American ornithologist Jared Diamond has suggested that in the central Pacific, {{where there are no}} seed-eating munias occupying the open habitats, species such as Vanuatu's blue-faced parrotfinch and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds.|$|E
