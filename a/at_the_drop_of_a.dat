25|$|As a {{young man}} Flanders seemed to be heading for a {{successful}} acting career. He contracted polio in 1943 while serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve {{and for the rest}} of his life was reliant on a wheelchair. He made a career as a prolific broadcaster on radio and later television, and together with his old schoolfriend, the composer Donald Swann, he wrote successful songs in the late 1940s and early and mid-1950s for revues in the West End of London. In 1956 they themselves performed some of these songs, along with new songs, in a two-man revue, <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hat. This show, and its successor, At the Drop of Another Hat, ran with occasional short breaks from 1956 to 1967 and played in theatres throughout the British Isles, the US, Australia and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|As a producer, Martin {{recorded}} the two-man show featuring Michael Flanders and Donald Swann, <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hat, which sold steadily for twenty-five years, although Martin's breakthrough {{as a producer}} came with the Beyond the Fringe show cast album, which starred Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller, and he would also produce the accompanying soundtrack album for David Frost's satirical BBC TV show That Was the Week That Was in 1963. Martin's work transformed the profile of Parlophone from a [...] "sad little company" [...] to a very profitable business.|$|E
500|$|Robben is {{regarded}} as one of the best wingers in the world, with ESPN stating he is [...] "able to take on and beat defenders <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat, Robben's ability to get to the byline and deliver in accurate crosses instils fear into any defence". Usually deployed on the right wing, Robben often cuts inside on his left foot to move to a more central attacking position, and uses his speed and dribbling skills to take on defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
500|$|We met land crabs, too, {{and were}} sadly disappointed. They were small, {{no larger than}} an {{ordinary}} edible crab, with bloated shells and moderately long pincers. Some were of beetroot purple, others yellow or orange, apparently two colour-phases of the same species. They were shy, freezing with pincers erect when alarmed, usually to be found within a short distance of their burrows and ready to scuttle down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat. In rainy weather they promenaded more freely, sometimes appearing {{at the side of}} road with arms waving like diminutive but aggressive hitch-hikers. Fringed mandibles [...] suggest a permanently turned-down mouth, giving them a disgruntled, unhappy expression; they were disagreeable rather than sinister and fell far short of their reputation. The first land crab I met was sitting in a prickly pear bush, sadly munching one of the brilliant red fruits and dribbling juice. I could never take them seriously after that.|$|E
500|$|IndieWire's Ben Travers praised Legion as [...] "the most intricate, {{intimate}} superhero {{story to}} date", highlighting {{its focus on}} [...] "an emotional journey for our leading lad", the central love story that turns the show [...] "from a 12 Monkeys mind-fuck to a Romeo & Juliet romance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat", and its cast. At Variety, Maureen Ryan stated that Stevens' performance [...] "is the glue that keeps Legion from flying apart", {{and the relationship between}} Haller and Barrett provides [...] "moments of solace in a viewing experience that can otherwise be exceptionally intense." [...] After the first three episodes, Ryan said that [...] "the challenge of Legion will be to make David’s quest for wholeness {{more than the sum of}} its flashy and often captivating parts. But the humane core of the drama offers a reason to hope for the best." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It might seem weird to have a Marvel show on FX, or to have it star that upper-crust Brit from Downton Abbey, filtered through the creator of Fargo, but somehow it all works." [...] He praised Stevens performance, and Hawley's [...] "optical hijinks" [...] even after the first episode, where the story starts to become more clear.|$|E

500|$|Referring to Columbia, Carey {{said in an}} {{interview}} [...] "That company, made a billion dollars from the raggedy girl he met at that party." [...] Throughout the marriage, Mottola, both Carey's husband and boss, carefully manipulated and controlled her career, crafting her into the adult contemporary/pop singer he sought her to be. With each album, Carey's genre influences and production styles evolved, leading her farther into R and hip-hop territory. By 1994, Carey was already the best-selling artist of the 1990s, and the labels best-selling act. Due to her continued success, Carey was able to take more creative control over subsequent projects. During the recording sessions for her fifth album Daydream (1995), the couple had already begun [...] "fighting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feather", due to his controlling nature over their personal life and her career. They separated in 1997, and divorced the following year. Carey described her sixth album Butterfly (1997) as her magnum opus, and her greatest and most personal work, due to its personal and emotional background. On the album's title track– written by Carey for Mottola– Carey reached out to him, asking to allow her to be free like a 'butterfly', and if the two were 'meant to be', then the butterfly 'would return'. In {{an interview}} with Interview magazine, Carey described the importance the song held for her, as well as its meaning: ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Keamy was {{described}} as a military type in his late-twenties who does not question orders. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty, Keamy is the polar opposite and his Marine mentality definitely sets him apart. [...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat. [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's bad, he knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy that does the job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{narrative}} introduction to their song Have Some Madeira M%27Dear, Michael Flanders of Flanders & Swann mentions a decanter he owns, - [...] "cut glass, from the Portobello Road" [...] - {{in which he}} keeps Madeira.

2500|$|Andrew Riemer, the Sydney Morning Herald's chief book reviewer, {{wrote in}} his {{obituary}} for her, [...] "Jolley could assume any one of several personas – the little old lady, the Central European intellectual, the nurse, the orchardist, the humble wife, the university teacher, the door-to-door salesperson – <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat, usually choosing one that would disconcert her listeners, but hold them in fascination as well".|$|E
2500|$|François Couture at AllMusic called Trondheim the [...] "crown jewel" [...] {{of the box}} set, {{saying it}} was [...] "some of [...] darkest and most thrilling music". John Kelman at All About Jazz {{described}} Trondheim as [...] "about as unapproachable as Henry Cow ever got, and yet amongst the densities and at times harsh realms are moments of profound beauty. The 80-minute improvisation ... demonstrates the kind of intuitive push-and-pull that could only come from musicians not just spending {{a great deal of}} time playing together, but also living together, with a potent ability to sometimes shift ambience and color <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dime." ...|$|E
2500|$|The opera also {{includes}} and parodies elements of melodrama, popular at the Adelphi Theatre. [...] There is a priggishly good-mannered poor-but-virtuous heroine, a villain who carries off the maiden, {{a hero in}} disguise and his faithful old retainer who dreams of their former glory days, the snake-in-the-grass sailor who claims to be following his heart, the wild, mad girl, the swagger of fire-eating patriotism, ghosts coming to life to enforce a curse, and so forth. [...] But Gilbert, in his customary topsy-turvy fashion, turns the moral absolutes of melodrama upside down: The hero becomes evil, the villain becomes good, and the virtuous maiden changes fiancés <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat. [...] The ghosts come back to life, foiling the curse, and all ends happily.|$|E

2500|$|Jake Vyper from Epic Stream chose Hunter x Hunter 2011 {{to be one}} of {{the best}} anime in 2010s. Digital Fox Media's Michael Basile of Fox Sports Digital Media praised the {{animation}} quality of the new adaptation, [...] "the animation actually appears to get better and better as the series progresses. The color palette can shift from vibrant and inviting to grim and menacing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat, the character designs are unique and appealing, the CG is very minimal, and the action sequences are some of the best that the shounen genre has ever produced, on-par with the best works of Studio Bones.

2500|$|In 1921, Ty Cobb {{took over}} from Hughie Jennings {{as manager of}} the Tigers. Bush became {{involved}} in repeated arguments with Cobb's [...] "first lieutenant", Dan Howley. The Detroit Free Press wrote that Howley [...] "never is quite so contented" [...] as he is when arguing with Bush and added: [...] "Bush would fight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat for Dan, yet the midget never gets nearly so mad at anyone as he does when Howley, with deliberate intent, corners Donie somewhere and starts a debate[...] [...] [...] Often Donie becomes so enraged that he pulls his cap off his head and throwing it off {{the door of the}} hotel lobby or in the turf of the ball field, stamps on it in his hysteria." [...] For {{the first half of the}} season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the tour itself got {{underway}} on 16 May in Brighton, the original eleven date itinerary had been expanded to fifteen dates. In defiance of sceptics, Ant successfully completed the entire schedule of tour dates which were overwhelmingly enthusiastically received – Dave Simpson of The Guardian rated 24 May 2011 Sheffield Academy concert four stars out of five, lauding [...] "Ant still has the moves. However, this near two-hour voyage through his back catalogue delves beyond the hits. From his edgy, left field punk days, Zerox, Car Trouble and the rest sound icy, sensual and dangerous. This entertaining, fun show has everything: sex (he playfully removes a backing singer's top and hands it back, quipping, [...] "Phew, I don't need that at my age"), surreal banter ("Hello, I'm Bryan Ferry") and controversy (Bob Geldof is [...] "a twat")." [...] and concluding [...] " [...] If an apparently finished album is anything like as good, Prince Charming's {{could be one of}} the great pop comebacks." [...] The Daily Mail reviewed the showcase concert of 26 May 2011 at London's IndigO2 venue before an audience of 2,500 (at which Ant fell offstage but recovered to complete the concert) and reported [...] "it sounds like the man who dominated the charts in the Eighties hasn't lost his touch", [...] and quoted an online review as stating [...] "Antmusic has lost none of its taste judging by a triumphant gig from Prince Charming himself and suggested he could lead his own Ant Army again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hat", adding that [...] "fans said it was good to see him back on form.".|$|E
