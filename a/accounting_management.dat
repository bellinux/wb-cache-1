40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{integrative}} definition of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> (KAM) at the organizational level through a content analysis of the existing definitions of KAM available in the business literatures. A representative pool of definitions of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> was generated through literature review from twenty three journals that covers the divergence of name variety like global <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> strategic <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> national <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> international key <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> key client <b>management,</b> major <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> key customers <b>management</b> and key <b>account</b> <b>management.</b> Relating to the definition of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> various attributes are identified through content analysis and according to the relevance, profile for each attributes are developed.

40|$|<b>Account</b> <b>management</b> has a rich {{tradition}} {{starting in}} the early 1960 ’s. At the same time, the concept is still ill-defined and under-researched. Consequently, some basic research questions remain unanswered. Is <b>account</b> <b>management</b> sales driven, marketing-driven or a strategy-driven process? Should the primary focus be on the management of sales activities towards important customers or should <b>account</b> <b>management</b> focus on relationship building and value creation {{in order to create}} a competitive advantage? The authors take a new perspective and examine <b>account</b> <b>management</b> from a (strategic) competence-based point of view. They study the relationship between <b>account</b> <b>management</b> and competence leverage. The central thesis is that <b>account</b> <b>management</b> is more strategically oriented than sales-oriented or relationship-oriented. Finally, they introduce the concept of strategic account and strategic <b>account</b> <b>management</b> and propose an agenda for further research in this domain...|$|R
40|$|Professionals take centre {{stage in}} the {{delivery}} of professional services and the role of <b>account</b> <b>management</b> has received little research attention. This thesis concerns the value of <b>account</b> <b>management</b> in professional service relationships in the audit, tax and management consultancy industry, contextualising the nature and value of <b>account</b> <b>management</b> through client and professional perspectives. It addresses the challenges of embedding the <b>account</b> <b>management</b> role in the firm as a role of the professional or a separate function. The aim of this thesis is to conceptualise a value framework for <b>account</b> <b>management.</b> Based on the principles of grounded theory, the method comprises 29 interviews with professionals, account managers and clients. Embracing an emergent, iterative process, the lenses used to reflect on these interviews include service dominant logic, relationships, the nature of professions and professionals along with client value and notions of organisational change. The emergent perceived value framework comprises five themes. Apart from the theme ¿perceived value of account management¿, the other themes can be conceptualised at three levels: ¿ external environment; ¿ firm¿s organisation and the professional-client relationships; ¿ and <b>account</b> <b>management.</b> Furthermore, the results indicate that professional service firms have difficulty in structuring and formalising <b>account</b> <b>management</b> implying a considerable organisational culture change management agenda. The role for <b>account</b> <b>management</b> varies between an integrated <b>account</b> <b>management</b> role performed by the professional in strategic services and by full-time dedicated account managers in more commoditised services and competitive environments. Well-embedded <b>account</b> <b>management</b> provides competitive advantage and differentiates the professional service firm...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a shift in recent decades in the {{business-to-business}} field in terms of advancements in technology and increased competition, thus leading to organisations become more attentive on embedding with customers. This concept {{is referred to as}} relationship management and a further concept to embed with strategically important customers is referred to as key <b>account</b> <b>management.</b> The use of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> has been described as highly individual and it is implemented in various ways and has different approaches. However, it was found that {{there is a lack of}} research regarding important aspects of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> and how they are conducted in practices in mid-sized organisations with and without a formal key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> programmes. The identified aspects were relationship <b>management,</b> key <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> key <b>account</b> manager, key accounts, key account teams and involvement from top management. By aiming to bridge this gap in research, the authors conducted in-depth interviews in two mid- sized organisations in Sweden, one with an implemented key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> programme and one without any formal key <b>account</b> <b>management.</b> The authors found by analysing the data gathered that there were findings suggesting that the aspects of KAM were performed by both organisations. Although the tasks in both organisations was performed by other individuals as suggested by the key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> literature.

40|$|Abstract. This paper uses two {{theoretical}} perspectives, {{information processing}} and resource dependency, to examine global <b>account</b> <b>management</b> (the co-ordination of activities involved in serving a single customer in multiple countries). It is hypothesized that global <b>account</b> <b>management</b> structures allow the multinational corporation (MNC) {{to increase its}} information processing capacity {{as well as its}} bargaining power vis-á-vis the global customer. Using data on 106 global accounts in 16 MNCs, we find support for both perspectives individually. Furthermore, evidence is presented for an interaction effect in which the effectiveness of structures for increasing information processing is conditional upon the presence of high customer dependence. 2 GLOBAL <b>ACCOUNT</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> IN MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS: THEORY AND EVIDENCE The coordination of customer management across national boundaries, commonly referred to as global <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> has {{emerged as one of the}} most prevalent corporate responses to the globalization of markets.
