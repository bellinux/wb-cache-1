Total entry under the family reunion plus skills category is subject to an <b>annual</b> <b>quota.</b> <b>Immigration</b> has often been a contentious issue in Australia. The main issues raised about migration to Australia, especially economic issues, are reviewed and discussed. These include impacts of immigrants on unemployment, wages, and available skills, their labour force participation, effect on unemployment, dependence on public funds, their settlement in urban areas, and immigration in relation to direct investment, tourism and provision of educational services. Aspects of Australian immigration are given special attention: the different economic experiences of English and non-English-speaking immigrants from Asia, the labour force participation rates of different groups of Asian immigrants, their employment by industry-types, their occupations and their income levels compared to the Australian born. This paper should dispel some of the misconceptions about the economic position and role of Australian immigrants...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{the effects}} of <b>immigration</b> <b>quotas</b> on growth and {{discounted}} welfare in a North-South version of the quality ladders growth model. <b>Immigration</b> <b>quotas</b> in the North increase {{the growth rate of}} utility for all consumers. However, they lower the static utility level and discounted welfare of Northern workers. Also the discounted welfare of asset owners drops. Hence, unlike in the static migration model where the representative agent in the host country benefits from immigration, in our dynamic migration model, the representative agent loses despite a positive growth effect of immigration. In general, the winners of a liberal immigration policy in the North are the immigrants and the remaining workers in the south. migration; growth; welfare...|$|R
40|$|By {{assuming}} a small open economy with dual labor markets and efficiency wages, we investigate {{the effects of}} changes in the <b>immigration</b> <b>quota</b> on the welfare of native workers, legal immigrants, and illegal immigrants under the different levels of employer sanctions, i. e., fines imposed by the authorities on the firms that employ illegal immigrants. For this purpose, we assume that the small open economy, which is faced with a large inflow of skilled and unskilled immigrants, is endeavoring to accept {{only a limited number of}} skilled immigrants by enforcing the <b>immigration</b> <b>quota</b> and employer sanctions. In this paper, we demonstrate that if fines are large, increases in the quota are likely to increase the legal worker welfare. However, if fines are small, increases in the quota are likely to decrease it. We also show that the wages and expected lifetime utilities of illegal immigrants do not depend on the quota and fines. These results suggest that increasing the quota for skilled immigrants does not necessarily have positive impacts on native workers and that the policy authority is required to manipulate the <b>immigration</b> <b>quota</b> and employer sanctions simultaneously in order to increase the native worker welfare...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a model with two industrialized countries that face {{a flow of}} immigration from the "rest of the world.

We consider a non-cooperative game between two countries' when their strategic instrument is the choice of an <b>immigration</b> <b>quota</b> and the world immigrant wages introduce the spill-over effect between two countries. We first show that the quota game admits unique pure strategies Nash equilibrium. We then compare the equilibrium choices of two countries and show that even though the larger country attracts more immigrants, it chooses lower quota than its smaller counterpart. It also turns out that higher degree of labor complementarity between natives and immigrants and a lower degree of cultural friction between two groups yield higher <b>immigration</b> <b>quota.</b> We also examine the welfare implications of countries choices' and argue that coordinated and harmonized immigration policies may improve the welfare of both countries.
