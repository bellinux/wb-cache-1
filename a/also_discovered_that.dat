5|$|Early in Dudley's career, he and John Holland {{developed}} {{a method for}} refining iridium that {{paved the way for}} commercial applications of the metal. Dudley <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> carbon monoxide was a major injurious component of tobacco smoke; {{and was one of the}} first to publish the physiological effects of X-rays with fellow Vanderbilt professor John Daniel.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> {{dissolved}} oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Libby {{accepted}} professorship at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, {{where he}} developed the technique for dating organic compounds using carbon-14. He <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> tritium similarly {{could be used for}} dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he {{became a member of the}} General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5000|$|Thandie Newton as Maeve Millay, a host; {{she is a}} madam. Like Dolores, she <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> {{her life}} is an {{elaborate}} lie.|$|R
5000|$|Davis <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> Tru's {{mother was}} {{supposed}} to be her mentor like Richard is to Jack but, with her dead, he now takes the role.|$|R
50|$|He <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> Eden had vast latent powers, {{including}} a mystical armor activated by a specific invocation including the word 'mantra', {{leading to the}} media dubbing her as such.|$|R
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> tropical cyclones {{have very little}} supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|The first (and only) {{production}} model (serial number S5, named Graywolf) was loaned to NCAR {{as a demonstration}} system in May 1993. NCAR's version was configured with 4 processors and a 128MWord (64-bit words, 1GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM proved to be problematic. It was <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the square root code contained a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong. Additionally, {{one of the four}} CPUs was not running reliably.|$|E
5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations {{played a key role in}} the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.|$|E

50|$|Both {{are fired}} after persuading the boss's son, Don Bates, to elope with Sally Conway, his sweetheart. But after Hubert uncovers a crime, he <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> he owns {{property}} worth $100,000.|$|R
5000|$|September 1 2006 - It {{turns out}} that between November and March there were 78 log-ins from the Liberal People's Party. Sentor <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> several known party members have logged in using their own names.|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Adelaide, South Australia, Oliphant {{graduated}} from the University of Adelaide in 1922. He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 {{on the strength of}} the research he had done on mercury, and went to England, where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. There, he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. He discovered the nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons). He <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> when they reacted with each other, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
50|$|Janie <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> the {{birthday}}, May 10, {{given to}} her by the Johnsons, is not her real birthday — Janie is actually six months younger than she had previously thought, with her real birthday being November 8.|$|R
5000|$|Buffy learns of Principal Wood's {{past and}} {{that his mother was}} a Slayer, though she doesn't know which one. She <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> Wood knows she is a Slayer, and that is why he hired her as a counselor.|$|R
50|$|Rowena (Ruth Connell) is {{gathering}} witches {{to join her}} new coven dubbed Mega Coven. She <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) is alive after the witches reveal a recent event. When they try to leave, Rowena kills them.|$|R
5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|The first {{unit of the}} 6th Airborne Division to land in Normandy, was Howard's coup-de-main force. The coup-de-main force {{landed in}} five gliders, over a five minute period (00:15–00:20); three landing near the Caen canal bridge and the {{remaining}} two near the Orne River bridge. Once on the ground, the troops emerged and assaulted the German positions. At the Caen canal bridge, troops assaulted German trench positions, attacked sentries, and threw grenades into a concrete bunker believed to hold the triggering equipment for the bridge demolition charges. At the Orne River bridge, a machine-gun nest was suppressed with mortar fire but no other defenders were found, and the two platoons captured the bridge before radioing Howard and informing him of their success. Both bridges had been secured within fifteen minutes, {{at the cost of}} {{only a small number of}} casualties. It was <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the bridges had not been rigged with explosives as believed.|$|E
5|$|The statue has {{required}} repair work {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems.|$|E

50|$|During the {{exploration}} of the Anfract during Transcendence, the explorers do, in fact, find the planet Genizee nested within the center along with a large orbital artifact. They <b>also</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> the interior of the planet of Genizee is itself an artifact.|$|R
5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was {{surprised to hear that}} his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E
50|$|The reader {{learns that}} Khaled lives as a prosperous and renowned French {{archeologist}} under {{the identity of}} Paul Martineau. He organizes terror attacks through an Arab associate in Marseilles. The reader <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> the arrangements for Khaled’s next attack are underway.|$|R
50|$|As Moist {{attempts}} {{to revitalize the}} service, he <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> {{a few months before}} taking the job, a number of his predecessors have predeceased in the building within weeks of each other in unusual circumstances. He <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> the mail inside the building has taken {{on a life of its}} own, and is nearly suffocated as a result.|$|R
50|$|Hemming <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> the Martians {{have been}} using genetic {{techniques}} to mimic humanity to an indistinguishable degree - but the government is already aware of this, and has been preventing any substantial return of veterans to Earth, in case {{they are in fact}} disguised Martians.|$|R
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|While {{purchasing}} {{a plot of}} land for her dowry, Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade stamp duty. Ambi, who accompanies her as she registered the property, refuses to help her. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As {{he is about to}} kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to NIMHANS where he is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Through recovered-memory therapy, the chief psychiatrist of the hospital uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that, when Ambi was fourteen years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which is the reason for his lofty ideals. It is <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. The psychiatrist declares that Remo will cease to exist if Nandini accepts Ambi's love, but Anniyan will cease to exist only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Rome, Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, the Abbot of Abingdon and the king's goldsmith, as his {{successor to the}} bishopric of London, claiming that Pope Leo IX had forbidden the consecration. Almost certainly the grounds were simony, the purchase of ecclesiastical office, as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice. In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc, Robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin, as {{he had his own}} candidate, a Norman, in mind. In the end Robert's favoured candidate, William the Norman, was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc. Robert <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin's hands, but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful. Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige's tenure as archbishop, which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim. These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin, which had begun with Robert's election. Robert's election had disrupted Godwin's patronage powers in Canterbury, and now Robert's efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl's economic rights. Events came to a head at a council held at Gloucester in September 1051, when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward. Godwin and his family were exiled; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of Kent, probably on the strength of Eadsige, his predecessor as Archbishop, having held the office.|$|E
50|$|The five <b>also</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> {{the patrons}} of the school along with their guardians and {{teachers}} are just as human as they themselves, which is not at all. The story largely concerns the main characters' investigations and discoveries about an otherworldly power struggle, and their place within it.|$|R
50|$|Bun {{comes out}} of {{retirement}} and <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> rather than being one man, Chi-Wai is a seven-spirit collective, with each perhaps representing {{an aspect of the}} seven deadly sins with the head, or brain, being a business-like woman. He <b>also</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> Chi-Wai had his gun stolen by an Indian, named Naresh Sherma, so he killed Wong to steal his gun.|$|R
50|$|They {{would later}} come across MERGE again in San Francisco while {{tracking}} {{the perpetrators of}} an attack on officers of the U.S. Coast Guard off the California coast. This time, however, they <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> MERGE had locked horns with its Oriental counterpart, a syndicate called TRIO. They would <b>also</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> TRIO {{was responsible for the}} attack on the Coast Guard officers.|$|R
