5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares at the man, before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Sargent and the Liverpool Philharmonic {{accompanied}} Albert Sammons, the dedicatee, in his 1944 {{recording of}} the Delius Violin Concerto. Later, in 1965, with Jacqueline du Pré, in her début recording, Sargent recorded Delius's Cello Concerto, coupled with the Songs of Farewell (1965). At {{the end of the}} war, Sargent turned to recording Elgar. A recording regularly chosen over all others in comparative surveys is the first of Sargent's two versions of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius with Heddle Nash as tenor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> Sargent pairing of the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded in 1945. Sargent was also the conductor for Heifetz's 1949 recording of Elgar's Violin Concerto and Paul Tortelier's first {{recording of the}} Cello Concerto in 1954. He also recorded Elgar's Wand of Youth Suite No. 2, with the BBC; the Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1 and 4 with the LSO; and the Enigma Variations with the Philharmonia. Sargent made two recordings of Holst's The Planets: a monaural version with the LSO for Decca (1950) and a stereo version with the BBC for EMI (1960). He also recorded shorter Holst pieces: The Perfect Fool ballet music and the Beni Mora suite.|$|E
5|$|From 13 December 1909 to 27 March 1910, Yorktown {{operated}} off Corinto, Nicaragua, {{with the}} Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron. She then pursued {{a schedule of}} exercises and maneuvers, operating between California and British Columbia through June and July. She returned to a posture of readiness off Corinto and San Juan del Sur between 13 August and 7 September. She then operated off Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Peruvian ports, with the United States Consul General at Large embarked, between 19 September and 16 October before putting into Panama for coal and stores. She subsequently patrolled at Amapala, Honduras, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> Corinto for most of November and December. She spent Christmas at Corinto before shifting to Amapala, en route to San Francisco and Mare Island. From March to July 1911, Yorktown cruised off the west coasts of Mexico, Nicaragua, and Honduras. On 29 May, she rescued the survivors from the foundered Panamanian steamer , which had sunk {{with the loss of}} 60 of its 100 passengers and crew. Another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 proceeded the ship's duties off the Pacific coasts of South and Central America. She returned to Mare Island in May 1912, and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 July.|$|E
25|$|Harlem Duet is {{considered}} to be a precursor to Shakespeare's Othello. The location is set on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X Boulevards. Sears choose this location because she wanted the audience to grasp the concept of race in the country, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> streets were more tangible to the North American Audience. The story follows main characters Othello and Billie and there withering marriage as Othello begins to lean towards a white identity mostly because of his affair with a character named Mona, who is a white woman. The story paints a picture of the white dominated North America.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated and {{controversial}} Tristan films was 1943's L'Éternel Retour (The Eternal Return), directed by Jean Delannoy (screenplay by Jean Cocteau). It is a contemporary retelling of the story with a man named Patrice in the Tristan role fetching a wife for his friend Marke. However, an evil dwarf tricks them into drinking a love potion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> plot ensues. The film was made in France during the Vichy regime, and elements in the movie reflect Nazi ideology, with the beautiful, blonde hero and heroine off-set by the Untermensch dwarf. The dwarf is given a larger role than in most interpretations of the legend; its conniving rains havoc on the lovers, much like the Jews of Nazi stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|The Baroque period, the 17th and 18th centuries, {{began to}} feature the {{major and minor}} scale based tonal system and harmony, {{including}} chord progressions and circle progressions. It was in the Baroque period that the accompaniment of melodies with chords was developed, as in figured bass, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> cadences (perfect authentic, etc.). In the Renaissance, certain dissonant sonorities that suggest the dominant seventh occurred with frequency. In the Baroque period the dominant seventh proper was introduced, and was in constant use in the Classical and Romantic periods. The leading-tone seventh appeared in the Baroque period and remains in use. Composers began to use nondominant seventh chords in the Baroque period. They became frequent in the Classical period, gave way to altered dominants in the Romantic period, and underwent a resurgence in the Post-Romantic and Impressionistic period.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{championship}} season, Elliott {{broke his}} wrist {{in a crash}} during testing at Daytona and required relief by Jody Ridley during several races {{in the first part}} of the 1989 season. Elliott won two poles and three races and finished sixth in the championship standings. In 1990, Elliott won one race and two poles and finished fourth in the championship standings. In the 1990 race at Atlanta, Elliott's rear tire changer Mike Rich was killed when Ricky Rudd lost control of his car, spun, and slammed the crew member between his car and Elliott's. This forced NASCAR to restrict the cars' speed on pit road. The 1991 season saw Elliott's sponsorship change to Coors Light <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> red on the car was replaced with blue. Elliott won once in the Pepsi 400 and won two poles and finished eleventh in the championship standings during his last season with Mellings.|$|E

25|$|Narcosis may be {{completely}} reversed {{in a few}} minutes by ascending to a shallower depth, with no long-term effects. Thus narcosis while diving in open water rarely develops into a serious problem as long as the divers are aware of its symptoms, and are able to ascend to manage it.

At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide.

500|$|J.Valmy-Baysse, in a 1910 {{overview}} of the artist, attributes Chabas's style to the painter's time at the family summer home along the Erdre; he identifies the [...] "grace of adolescence, its undefinable charm, [...] its chaste nudity" [...] of the models with Chabas's reminiscences of his youth. The art historian Bram Dijkstra has argued otherwise, stating that [...] "no artist was more assiduous in exploiting the prurient possibilities of the woman-child" [...] than Chabas, whom he considers to have [...] "emphasized analogies of nude little girls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> poses of vanity or physical arousal given to adult women".|$|E
500|$|Rilke {{depicted}} this infinite, transcendental beauty {{with the}} symbol of angels. However, he {{did not use the}} traditional Christian interpretation of angels. [...] He sought to utilize a symbol of the angel that was secular, divorced from religious doctrine and embodied a tremendous transcendental beauty. [...] In this, however, Rilke commented that he was greatly influenced by the depiction of angels found in Islam. For Rilke, {{the symbol of}} the angel represents a perfection that is [...] "beyond human contradictions and limitations" [...] in a [...] "higher level of reality in the invisible." [...] Where there is incongruity that adds to mankind's despair and anxiety is due to [...] human nature keeping us clinging to the visible <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar.</b> As mankind encounters the invisible and unknown higher levels represented by these angels, the experience of the invisible will be [...] "terrifying" [...] (in German, schrecklich).|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending circularity and a rich, child-like quality. It has a timelessness to it, {{not in the sense}} that you think their music will always be valid, but in the sense that it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Daryl H. Miller of Los Angeles Times wrote positively of the episode, claiming it is [...] "craftily written, solidly acted and moodily photographed". Michael R. Farkash of The Hollywood Reporter gave {{the first part}} of the episode a largely positive review. Farkash called it [...] "entertaining and appealing" [...] and noted its [...] "suspenseful plot twists and fascinating visuals". An unnamed staff writer of Airlock Alpha was mostly positive about the episode, with the exception of Cary Elwes as Brad Follmer, calling Elwes' acting [...] "forced". Rob Lowman from the Los Angeles Daily News said that Carter had been able to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the series mythology arc, and had a positive view of Lucy Lawless' performance. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. Starpulse named the changed credits the [...] "Most Shocking Moment" [...] in the series run, writing that the most drastic moment [...] "came with the opening credits for season nine, a complete re-design that saw Annabeth Gish and Mitch Pileggi added to the opening sequence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> graphics totally scrapped.

500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far better off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them." [...] According to Sarah Larson of The New Yorker, [...] "Sansa watches calmly, then smiles. You've come a long way, baby. Or she's become a monster, and so have I. The women of Westeros are on the warpath." ...|$|E
