A basic overview and evaluation {{of the performance of}} existing current-detection algorithms for active power filters are presented. According to different complicated power quality issues and various compensation purposes, a novel current-detection algorithm is then proposed. Comparing with existing algorithms, this algorithm has shorter response time delay and clearer physical meaning. Different compensating current references can, thus, be accurately and easily obtained by adopting the proposed algorithm. It ensures that the shunt APF can very well achieve different compensation purposes. Moreover, it is very easy to implement this algorithm in a digital signal processor (DSP).

40|$|Abstract—Repetitive control (RC), {{which can}} achieve zero {{steady-state}} error tracking of any periodic signal with known integer period, offers active power <b>filters</b> (<b>APFs)</b> a promising accurate current control scheme to compen-sate the harmonic distortion caused by nonlinear loads. However, classical RC cannot exactly compensate periodic signals of variable frequency and {{would lead to}} significant performance degradation of APFs. In this paper, a frac-tional-order RC (FORC) strategy at a fixed sampling rate is proposed to deal with any periodic signal of variable frequency, where a Lagrange-interpolation-based fractional delay (FD) filter is used to approximate the factional delay items. The synthesis and analysis of FORC systems are also presented. The proposed FORC offers fast online tun-ing of the FD and the fast update of the coefficients, and then provides APFs with a simple but very accurate real-time frequency-adaptive control solution to the elimination of harmonic distortions under grid frequency variations. A case study on a single-phase shunt APF is conducted. Ex-perimental results are provided {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed FORC.

Series APF is used to mitigate problems caused due to voltage distortion and unbalance present in source voltage and make load voltage perfectly balanced and regulated. The control scheme used is Hysteresis voltage controller by using a-b-c to d-q transformations.
