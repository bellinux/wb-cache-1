The P 40 was {{designated as a}} heavy tank in Italy, not because of its weight, but because of its intended role {{in support of the}} widely used medium ("M") tanks on the battlefields. In weight, armour and armament it was similar to the medium tanks of the Wehrmacht or other contemporary armies, its armament and protection being roughly the same as the early production American M4 Sherman tank. It was the final evolution of Italian tank designs, that began with the Vickers-based tankettes (such as the CV29 and L3/35) and developed into models such as the M11/39 medium tank, a much heavier construction whose internal design shared many characteristics of the earlier tankettes.|$|E

During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: George Segal, Claes Oldenburg, Arman, Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Manuel Neri and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were Robert Graham in a classic articulated style and Fernando Botero bringing his painting's [...] "oversized figures" [...] into monumental sculptures. Ceramic sculpture as practiced by Pablo Picasso, Peter Voulkos, Stephen De Staebler, Kenneth Price, and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{main and}} {{longitudinal}} girders {{have been designed}} <b>as</b> <b>welded</b> lattice steel members of sufficient depth to incorporate the access walkways. In addition to transferring the roof load to the columns these girders also have the 'V' strain insulators attached to them. The side framing of the building as well as carrying the wall cladding also supports the wall bushings and provides anchorage for the strainer connections between the turbine house and the switch house. The switch house was designed so as to fit in the architectural treatment of the Power Station as a whole. The plastic-coated aluminium cladding is therefore coloured black on {{the north and south}} faces of the building and gold on the east and west. The roof line of the switch house is designed to blend with the 'saw tooth' effect on the turbine house roof. Construction work began in the severely cold winter of 1962/63. The cold weather was turned to advantage as the clay subsoil which is generally unmanageable when wet was frozen solid. Excavation went on uninterrupted on drainage branches during this period. The wet mix base was next introduced over all the site. The object of the wet mix was to apply a firm layer for the construction to be carried on even when subsoil clay was wet. Construction traffic also tended to compact the wet mix therefore improving it as a base for the final topcoat of bitumen macadam.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} has been undertaken to evaluate thermal fatigue resistance for the dissimilar welded joints under repeating thermal cycling.

C. The test conditions as follow : maximum temperature was varied 400 ℃ to 650 ℃, the minimum temperature was 10 ℃, cyclic rate was about 3 c. p. m [...] The following results were obtained. 1) In respect of welded joints, the thermal fatigue resistance were depended on the resistance of base metals at high temperature, that is the all welded joints were fractured within 2 (1 / 4) Cr- 1 Mo steel. 2) Decarburization zone was seen in 2 (1 / 4) Cr- 1 Mo site of weld bond for <b>as</b> <b>welded</b> joints which were heated than 500 ℃. The same decarburization occurred in the post heat treated joints, but these zone did not extend during thermal fatigue test. Therefor, this explained that the different of thermal fatigue resistance between <b>as</b> <b>welded</b> joints and post heat treated joints become smaller. 3) Thermal fatigue cracks tended to initiate and propagate preferentially in and through the decarburization zone 4) The resistance of thermal fatigue for dissimillar welded joints are strongly depended on the characteri-stics of decarburization zone...|$|E
