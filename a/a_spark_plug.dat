25|$|Gilbert v Hickinbottom {{featured}} {{an exception}} to the general rule, where there were two properties in the same occupation, separated by a public highway. It was held that the functional connection between the two properties was so great that they were to be treated as a single hereditament. Functional connection is judged by the strength of the connection and the degree and nature of the separation. In Edwards (VO) v.

25|$|During {{qualifying}} for the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest times in Q2 and Q3 clinching pole by {{just over a}} tenth of second from Ferrari's Felipe Massa. From the lights Sebastian Vettel led until lap 33 when the car had what was at first {{thought to be a}} broken exhaust but was later revealed to be <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> problem which reduced the power and straight line speed. Over the remaining laps of the race Vettel dropped down to fourth behind both Ferraris and Lewis Hamilton where he would finish the race. Webber finished 8th.|$|E

25|$|At New Hampshire for the Camping World RV Sales 301, Johnson {{qualified}} second, {{but failed}} post-qualifying inspection after {{his car was}} found to be too low, and started the race in 43rd, {{the first time in his}} career he started dead last. In the race, Johnson passed seven cars in the first four laps and reached the Top 20 by lap 50, while reaching the top ten by lap 165; Johnson would finish sixth. He almost won the pole position at Indianapolis but was bumped to second by Ryan Newman. Johnson led the most laps and almost won, but a slow final pit stop cost him the race to Newman. The following week at Pocono, Johnson won another pole position, setting another track qualifying record. He led 43 of the first 80 laps before he cut a right front tire that knocked <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> loose and affected the handling of the car. Johnson's pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing the plug on the last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.|$|E
25|$|During the 1938 racing season Meier, rode a BMW RS 255 Kompressor in both European and German Championships. For the 1938 Isle of Man TT, Meier {{was entered}} by the BMW team along with Jock West and Karl Gall. The BMW team {{suffered}} setbacks when Karl Gall {{was injured in}} a crash during an unofficial practice, {{was found in a}} ditch above the Gooseneck, and was unable to race. On the startline for the 1938 Senior TT Race, one of the BMW mechanics stripped a cylinder-head thread during <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> change on the engine of Meier's Type 255 machine. Trying to start the 1938 Senior race on one cylinder, Meier soon retired on lap one at the bottom of Bray Hill. The race was won Harold Daniell riding for Norton at an average race speed of 89.11mph and Jock West riding the works supercharged BMW finished in 5th place at an average race speed of 85.92mph. In 1938, Meier {{went on to win the}} 500cc Belgium Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, the 500cc Dutch TT, the German Grand Prix at the Hohenstein-Ernstthal (or Sachsenring) road course and the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The 500cc 1938 Ulster Grand Prix was won by BMW teammate Jock West and Meier became the 1938 500cc European Motor-Cycle Champion.|$|E

500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show. Springsteen said, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for {{making it possible for}} Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> {{is said to}} be [...] "hot" [...] if it is {{a better}} heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the spark plug. <b>A</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> {{is said to be}} [...] "cold" [...] if it can conduct more heat out of the spark plug tip and lower the tip's temperature.

5000|$|One {{problem with}} this design is that, even with a {{properly}} sized capacitor, {{there will be some}} arcing at the points. Arcing causes the points to [...] "burn." [...] This in turn introduces resistance at the point contacts that reduces primary current and resulting <b>spark</b> intensity. <b>A</b> second problem involves the mechanical cam-follower block that rides on the distributor cam and opens the points. The block wears over time, reducing how much the points open (the [...] "point gap") and causing a corresponding change in both the ignition timing and the fraction of time during which the points are closed. Tune-ups for older vehicles usually involve replacing the points and condenser and setting the gap to factory specifications. A third problem involves the distributor cap and rotor. These components can develop conductive [...] "sneak paths" [...] on their surfaces (also called 'tracking') across which the coil's secondary voltage produces a current, often {{in the form of an}} arc, that bypasses the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> When sneak paths develop, the only remedy is replacement of the cap and/or rotor. A fourth problem can arise when one or more of <b>an</b> engine's <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> becomes [...] "fouled." [...] Fouling, caused by combustion-byproducts that form deposits on <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug's</b> internal insulator, creates an electrically conductive path that dissipates the coil's energy before its secondary voltage can rise high enough to produce <b>a</b> <b>spark.</b> So-called capacitive discharge ignition systems create coil voltages with much shorter rise times and can produce <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> across <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> with some fouling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distributor}} rotor connects the high voltage {{to one of}} the outer terminals around the cap where <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> wire carries it to <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> When the voltage is high enough it jumps the gap of the spark plug and ignites the fuel air mixture in the cylinder's combustion chamber ...|$|E
5000|$|The wire {{from each}} spark plug is {{just long enough}} to reach the distributor, without excess. Each end of <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> wire has a metal {{terminal}} that clips onto the spark plug and distributor, coil, or magneto. There are dedicated spark plug wire pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> without damaging it.|$|E
