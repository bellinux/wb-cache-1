5|$|Written by Michael Feeney Callan, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} on 5 February 1985. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the hiatus, Callan {{was asked by the}} production team to continue with the story but as four 25 minute episodes. It had been planned that an adaptation of this story would appear as part of Big Finish's The Lost Stories range, but fell through due to the author's other commitments and was replaced by The Macros.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which indicates {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the assassination broke.|$|E

5|$|Edward I mobilised another {{army for}} the Scottish {{campaign}} in 1307, which Prince Edward {{was due to}} join that summer, but the elderly King had been increasingly unwell and died on 7 July at Burgh by Sands. Edward travelled from London immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> reached him, and on 20 July he was proclaimed king. He continued north into Scotland and on 4 August received homage from his Scottish supporters at Dumfries, before abandoning the campaign and returning south. Edward promptly recalled Piers Gaveston, who was then in exile, and appointed him as the Earl of Cornwall, before arranging his marriage to the wealthy Margaret de Clare. Edward also arrested his old adversary Bishop Langton, and dismissed him from his post as treasurer. Edward I's body was kept at Waltham Abbey for several months before being taken for burial to Westminster, where Edward erected a simple marble tomb for his father.|$|E
5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of {{this public}} tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of {{blame for the}} botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury, Ralph d'Escures, {{refused to}} consecrate Thurstan unless the archbishop-elect made a {{profession}} of {{obedience to the}} southern see. This {{was part of the}} long-running Canterbury-York dispute, which started in 1070. Thurstan refused to make such a profession, and asked the king for permission to go to Rome to consult Pope Paschal II. Henry I refused to allow him to make the journey, but even without a personal appeal from Thurstan, Paschal decided against Canterbury. At the Council of Salisbury in 1116 the English king ordered Thurstan to submit to Canterbury, but instead Thurstan publicly resigned the archibishopric. On his way to the Council, Thurstan had received letters from Paschal II that supported York and commanded that he should be consecrated without a profession. Similar letters had gone to Ralph d'Escures from the pope, ordering Ralph, as Archbishop of Canterbury, to consecrate Thurstan. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the letters became public, Thurstan's resignation was ignored, and he continued to be considered the archbishop-elect.|$|E

5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would think she was back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, while Belisarius remained in Carthage strengthening its walls, Gelimer established {{himself and the}} remnant of his army at Bulla Regia. By distributing money {{he had managed to}} cement the loyalty of the locals to his cause, and sent messages recalling Tzazon and his men from Sardinia, where they had been successful in re-establishing Vandal authority and killing Godas. While waiting for Tzazon's arrival, the Vandal king's army also increased by the arrival of more and more fugitives from the battle of Ad Decimum, as well as by a contingent of his Moorish allies. Most of the Moorish tribes of Numidia and Byzacena, however, sent embassies to Belisarius, pledging allegiance to the Empire. Some even offered hostages and asked for the insignia of office traditionally awarded to them by the emperor: a gilded silver staff and a silver crown, a white cloak, a white tunic, and a gilded boot. Belisarius had been furnished by Justinian with these items in anticipation of this demand, and duly dispatched them along with sums of money. Nevertheless, it was clear that, as long as the outcome of the war remained undecided, neither side could count on the firm loyalty of the Moors. During this period, messengers from Tzazon, sent to announce his recovery of Sardinia, sailed into Carthage unaware that the city had fallen and were taken captive, followed shortly after by Gelimer's envoys to Theudis, who had reached Spain <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the Roman successes had arrived there and hence failed to secure an alliance. Belisarius was also reinforced by the Roman general Cyril with his contingent, who had sailed to Sardinia only to find it once again in possession of the Vandals.|$|E
5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, Japanese planes were seen making {{reconnaissance}} flights over Miri. The Brooke government {{decided on a}} complete destruction of oilfields and airfields in Miri. Shell company officials received orders {{to carry out the}} Denial Scheme on 8 December 1941. In the evening on the same day, the task was completed. All producing oil wells were sealed up with vital equipment and machinery dismantled and shipped off to Singapore. Skilled workers and important company papers also went along with the equipment and sent to Singapore. The Punjab Regiment and several officials were sent to guard Kuching. On 16 December 1941, 9 days after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Japanese troops consisting of 10,000 men landed on Tanjung Lobang Beach, Miri without much resistance. However, on 19 December 1941, a Dutch flying boat from Tarakan Island attacked the Japanese destroyer Shinonome (under the command of Hiroshi Sasagawa) off Miri. The ship was sunk along with the entire crew of 228. Another flying boat X-33 also damaged a Japanese transport ship. After the fall of Singapore on 15 January 1942, skilled workers that went into hiding with their equipment were sent back to Miri by the Japanese. They were immediately put to work for Japanese oil supply service company named Nen Ryo Hai Kyu. Much of the Japanese oil drilling and refinery equipment was portable. A total of 0.75 million barrels were produced during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945.|$|E
