5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Moscow {{continued}} activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having {{to control the}} Rus' population within its borders <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to count on loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As {{a result of the}} protracted war {{at the turn of the}} 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired large tracts of territory east of the Dnieper River. Polish assistance and involvement were increasingly becoming a necessary component of the balance of power in the eastern reaches of the Lithuanian domain.|$|E

5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but {{in an era when}} overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E

25|$|From 1000 to 1300 the {{population}} increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300 {{seventy percent of}} the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.|$|E

St-Pierre {{went on to win the}} fight by unanimous decision (50–43, 50–44, 50–45). After the fight, he stated that he was glad to win but was not impressed by his performance, stating that he wanted to finish the fight which fans agreed.

500|$|The story Cipriano {{originally}} [...] {{wanted in}} The Inquirer was never published. Cipriano accused The Inquirer of censoring his report and giving into demands from the Archdiocese.

[...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible.

Maeda decided fairly early on to make Yuu Otosaka a low-life cheater at the start of Charlotte because he had never created a character like that before. When trying to choose a title for Charlotte, Maeda's friend Taisei Nakagawa proposed a title which could be abbreviated as [...] "AA" [...] based on its similarity to Angel Beats! abbreviation of [...] "AB". However, Maeda did not like the title, and devised the title Charlotte as one that would surpass the original [...] "AA" [...] title.

500|$|Grant {{was at the}} Adler Theatre in Davenport, Iowa, on the {{afternoon}} of November 29, 1986, preparing for his performance in Conversation with Cary Grant when he was taken ill. Though his close friend Roderick Mann recalled that he had met up with Grant at the Hollywood Park Racetrack earlier that month and he had been in a jovial state and in good health, Grant had been feeling unwell as he arrived at the theatre.

Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before [...] "something seemed wrong" [...] all of a sudden, and he disappeared backstage. Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife Barbara had checked in, and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke, with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130.
