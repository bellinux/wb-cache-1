40|$|In {{wireless}} ad hoc sensor networks, {{energy use}} {{is in many}} cases the most important constraint since it corresponds directly to operational lifetime. Topology management schemes such as GAF put the redundant nodes for routing to sleep in order to save the energy.

In this paper we study a simple linear network and deduce the relationship between optimal <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> and traffic.

40|$|Motorola’s {{lineup of}} rugged {{cordless}} scanners employs the Bluetooth standard for transmitting information wirelessly. When a scanner is {{paired with a}} cradle or other device, the data is exchanged over a radio frequency link using the 2. 4 – 2. 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum. Of great importance in nearly any cordless scanner application is the <b>radio</b> <b>range,</b> which is defined as how far apart scanner and cradle/BT device can operate without a loss of the radio connection.

30|$|In ad hoc {{wireless}} networks, distances {{have little}} meaning, unless the range {{capabilities of the}} chosen radio technology are also specified. For this reason, we have chosen to express distance in the nominal <b>radio</b> <b>range.</b> Moreover, we will treat node densities by the average node degree. The average node degree, c, is {{the average number of}} nodes per area covered by the nominal <b>radio</b> <b>range,</b> defined as ρπr 2, where ρ is the average node density and r is the nominal <b>radio</b> <b>range.</b> For Poisson distributed nodes in an infinitely large system, the average node degree equals the average expected number of neighbors of a node [19].|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{received}} signal strength (RSS)-based scheme for identity-based attacks’ counteraction. Since the RSS is a rough indicator of distance, {{we use the}} distance parameter to detect identity attacks in two ways: in a single <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> and, locally and globally, in the network. Each node will use the proposed algorithm in a distributed manner using the distance parameter to detect malicious identities in its own <b>radio</b> <b>range.</b> In addition to that, each node will also cooperate and collaborate with its neighbours to detect these attacks using our proposed global map algorithm. As soon as a malevolent identity is detected, it will be quarantined and will be blacklisted for future communication that are either detected in same <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> or different <b>radio</b> <b>ranges</b> within the network. It is worth mentioning that our scheme neither takes the services of any other third party nor does it use any sort of extra hardware, such as directional antennae or GPS. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is lightweight since it does not create any extra overhead on the overall architecture of the network.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{improved}} {{version of the}} graded precision localization algorithm GRADELOC, called IGRADELOC is proposed. The performance of GRADELOC {{is dependent on the}} regions formed by the overlapping <b>radio</b> <b>ranges</b> of the nodes of the underlying sensor network. A different region pattern could significantly alter the nature and precision of localization. In IGRADELOC, two improvements are suggested. Firstly, modifications are proposed in the <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> of the fixed-grid nodes, keeping in mind the actual <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> of commonly available nodes, to allow for routing through them. Routing is not addressed by GRADELOC, but is of prime importance to the deployment of any adhoc network, especially sensor networks. A theoretical model expressing the <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> in terms of the cell dimensions of the grid infrastructure is proposed, to help in carrying out a deployment plan which achieves the desirable precision of coarse-grained localization. Secondly, in GRADELOC it is observed that fine-grained localization does not achieve significant performance benefits over coarse-grained localization. In IGRADELOC, this factor is addressed with the introduction of a parameter {{that could be used to}} improve and fine-tune the precision of fine-grained localization. ...|$|R

30|$|Current MAC {{protocols}} do {{not eliminate}} idle listening. Event-driven wake-up radios {{provide an opportunity}} to solve idle listening. Previously published wake-up radios are low power with low sensitivity [6 – 14]. They provide extremely low energy consumption at the cost of shorter read range than the data radio [15]. They effectively limit the data <b>radio</b> <b>range.</b> As low power wake-up radio provides short <b>radio</b> <b>ranges,</b> senders must be within a short distance away to trigger the wake-up radio. Because the wake-up range is typically much smaller than the data <b>radio's</b> communication <b>range,</b> the use of wake-up radios constrains the data communication range. This in turn effectively increases the deployment density, which is not suitable to sensor networks.|$|R
