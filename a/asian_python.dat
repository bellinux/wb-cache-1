60|$|Spanish, {{you would}} say; Andalusian, or, better still, Basque; that compound, like the diamond, of {{darkness}} and fire. Hair, the shade of purple grapes viewed at midnight. Eyes, long, dusky, and disquieting with their untroubled directness of gaze. Face, haughty and bold, touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life. To hasten conviction of her charm, but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner, green, and yellow, and white. Upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose. Irresistible, in black lace and yellow ribbons, she faces you; a blue racer is spiralled upon each bare arm; coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck, his horrid head close to hers, you perceive Kuku, the great eleven-foot <b>Asian</b> <b>python.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audiencePythons are {{harvested}} {{for the international}} leather industry and pet trade. We analyzed the CITES export records (1999 - 2008) of the most intensively commercialized wild pythons (Python regius,Python sebae,Python reticulatus,Python molurus,Python curtus species complex) from African and Asian countries where reliable data on trade rates and ecology are available. Mean declared annual numbers of exported pythons were 30, 000 in five African countries and 164, 000 in Indonesia. Trade intensity tripled in Indonesia over the last decade, but declined in Africa. African international trade is exclusively associated with the pet market (mainly United States and Europe), whereas <b>Asian</b> <b>pythons</b> are sold mostly for luxury leather, albeit more recently also for the pet trade. A negative correlation between the annual numbers of pythons traded in Africa vs. Asia suggests a rapid and recent shift of the pressure exerted on wild populations in the two main exporting continents. We also found a strong effect of the currency exchange rate (i. e., U. S. $/€, the currencies used by the major importing countries) on African python exports: when the cost per African python increased, importers relied increasingly on Asian providers for pet trade. Overall, our data indicate that <b>Asian</b> <b>pythons</b> (especially P. reticulatus) might be threatened due to the rapidly increasing pressure, whereas the decreasing international trade in African pythons is likely more sustainable...|$|R

5000|$|Neo{{evolution}}ism is {{a social}} theory that tries to explain the evolution of societies by drawing on Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and discarding some dogmas of the previous social evolutionism. Neoevolutionism is concerned with long-term, directional, evolutionary social change and with the regular patterns of development that {{may be seen in}} unrelated, widely separated cultures. 'Neoevolutionism' is also a controversial scientific theory claiming that evolution is a ongoing process that is continuing to occur in the present day. Examples being coyote-dog hybrids across North America and hybrids of African and <b>Asian</b> <b>pythons</b> in Florida. The biological theory of neoevolutionism recognizes that human beings are responsible for significantly changing the earths environment and new species are evolving {{as a direct result of}} these changes. Exotic species introduced into new environments have the most potential to adaptively radiate as they exploit available niches in their new ecosystem.|$|R

It {{features}} reptiles such as West African crocodiles, Gila monsters, veiled chameleons, pancake tortoises, leopard tortoises, plated lizards, Bell's hinge-back tortoises, Burmese <b>pythons,</b> <b>Asian</b> leaf turtles, Asian water monitors and East African black mud turtles, {{as well as}} invertebrates such as Macleay's spectres and Chilean rose tarantulas.|$|R

Painted-lip lizard and Lankascincus fallax are among them. Saltwater crocodile, Indian <b>python,</b> <b>Asian</b> water monitor, and Bengal monitor are among the other reptiles. Four of the fresh water fishes recorded from Minneriya are endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|R
40|$|I welcome my {{thoughtful}} critics. If {{there is}} to be progress in environmental ethics, it will result from interchanges such as these. I start with my recent experience in Nepal, using that to bring to initial focus where I think my differences with Attfield, Brennan, and Minteer lie. Later I turn, in too summary a way, to some more specific complaints. Royal Chitwan National Park in Nepal is a primary sanctuary for Bengal tigers and the Asian rhinoceros, both extremely endangered species. Other endangered species protected in the area are the sloth bear, the pygmy hog, the swamp dear, the black buck, the <b>Asian</b> rock <b>python,</b> and the gharial crocodile (the world's most endangered crocodile). The park exists because the region, in lowland Nepal, was too malarious to live in year round until the 1950 's. In earlier years, what is now the park area was kept as a hunting preserve for the Rana rulers of Nepal in the dry season. Oddly, the tigers and rhinos survived because of the mosquitoes. Following a mosquito eradication campaign in mid-century, Nepalis bega...|$|R
50|$|The reptile {{house was}} remodeled in 2012 to include taipans, death adders, Chinese {{alligator}}, and alligator snapping turtle. With the renovations the building houses mostly reptiles. The exhibit houses {{many species of}} cobras, rattle snakes, and lizards. There are two large areas where the zoo's Komodo dragons are held. In a building located near the Reptile House the zoo's temporary home for a large adult salt water crocodile and for Slender-snouted crocodile. On {{the outside of the}} Reptile House is the new Gator Swamp Exhibit, which is a large outdoor heated pool housing several adult American alligators. The reptile house received more renovations in 2017 to improve digital interpretive signage and interactive displays. Other species on display in the true reptile house as of 2017 include: Bismark Ringed <b>Python,</b> <b>Asian</b> Water Monitor, Quince monitor, Cottonmouth, Matamata Turtle, Black Mamba, Storr's Pigmy Monitor, Green Anaconda, Jumping Viper, Western Diamondback Rattlesnake, Gila Monster, Grand Caymon Blue Iguana, Rhinoceros Viper, White Lipped Viper, Red Spitting Cobra, and Black Spitting Cobra.|$|R
