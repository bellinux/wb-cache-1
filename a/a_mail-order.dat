Sinclair had previously made its name as <b>a</b> <b>mail-order</b> retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E

The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of work full time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted the liberty of his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} days of the Canal Zone, the ICC {{provided}} no food, and workers had to fend for themselves, obtaining poor-quality food at inflated prices from Panamanian merchants. When Stevens arrived in 1905, he ordered food to be provided at cost, leading to the establishment of the Canal Zone Commissary. The functions of the Commissary quickly grew, generally against the will of the Panamanian government, which saw more and more goods and services provided in the Zone rather than in Panama. Merchants could not compete with the commissary's prices or quality; for example, it boasted that the meat it sold had been refrigerated every moment from the Chicago slaughterhouse to the moment it was passed to the consumer. By 1913, it consisted of 22 general stores, 7 cigar stores, 22 hostels, 2 hotels, and <b>a</b> <b>mail-order</b> division. It served high-quality meals at small expense to workers and more expensive meals to upper-echelon canal employees and others able to afford it.|$|E

500|$|At first, Myst had no music, {{because the}} Millers {{did not want}} music to {{interfere}} with the gameplay. After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, [...] "seemed to really help the mood of certain places that you were at in the game." [...] Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of synthesized music that was used in the game and later published as Myst: The Soundtrack. Mixing and effects were done on an E-mu Proteus MPS synthesizer. The soundtrack was recorded over the course of two weeks' evenings. Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via <b>a</b> <b>mail-order</b> service, but before the release of Mysts sequel, Riven, Virgin Records acquired the rights to release the soundtrack, and the CD was rereleased on April 21, 1998.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} Cardell had {{also used the}} term Wicca, evidenced {{by the fact that}} Margaret Bruce, the owner of <b>a</b> <b>mail-order</b> business selling occult titles, wrote a letter to her friend Gerald Gardner on 23 February 1960, in which she consoled him on the attacks made against him by Cardell and included a poem in which she referred to [...] "the 'Wicca'". In Melissa Seims' opinion, this use of Wicca was explicitly in reference to the Cardellian Craft, and therefore meant [...] "that this spelling, along with 'Wiccan', was used by Cardell." [...] However, {{it is also possible that}} Bruce was referring to [...] "the Wicca" [...] as [...] "a community of Pagan Witches", in which case it would be a misspelling of Gardner's [...] "the Wica".|$|E

Alongside Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry, and Eric Clapton, she topped the UK Singles Chart in 1995 with the charity single [...] "Love Can Build a Bridge". Later that year, she signed with Warner Music UK's label WEA and released the album It's a Man's World (1995), which {{came out of her}} idea of covering men's songs from a woman's point of view. In general, critics favored the album and its R influences, some saying her voice had improved. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that [...] "From an artistic standpoint, this soulful collection of grown-up pop songs... is the high point of her recording career." [...] It's a Man's World reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the UK top-ten single [...] "One by One". Tracks were remixed for the American release of the album, abandoning its original rock sound in favor of a style more accessible to U.S. radio; it reached number 64 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

Although the dog's life is saved, the family begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices and starts treating him badly, causing him to run away. He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa's Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops. In [...] "The Canine Mutiny" [...] (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake charge card to buy a well-trained rough collie named Laddie from <b>a</b> <b>mail-order</b> catalog. Laddie learns many tricks that Santa's Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa's Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tries to get him back. When he finally finds him, Santa's Little Helper is serving as a seeing-eye dog for a blind man, but eventually decides to return to the family.|$|E
