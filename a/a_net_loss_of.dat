5|$|The Wiz {{proved to}} be a {{commercial}} failure, as the $24million production only earned $13.6million at the box office. Though prerelease television broadcast rights had been sold to CBS for over $10million, in the end, the film produced <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> $10.4million for Motown and Universal. At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made. The film's failure steered Hollywood studios away from producing the all-black film projects that had become popular during the blaxploitation era of the early to mid-1970s for several years.|$|E

During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E
5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

5|$|Gran Trak 10 was {{developed}} {{during a time}} of several internal changes at Atari; as a result communication problems led Atari to not accurately track the expense of manufacturing the game. It was initially sold to distributors for <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> US$100 per cabinet; although this flaw was fixed it contributed to a total loss of $500,000 for the company that fiscal year, placing Atari in financial difficulties. The game itself was successful, and led to several versions of the game being produced in 1974 by Atari and its subsidiary Kee Games, including a smaller cabinet version titled Trak 10 and a two-player version titled Gran Trak 20, as well as numerous later racing games. Gran Trak 10 was the first arcade car racing game, though Atari had released the drag racing game Space Race in 1973, and a simple racing game, Wipeout, was included with the 1972 Magnavox Odyssey console.|$|E
5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the company's deteriorating {{financial}} situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or nearly one-fourth of its workforce.|$|E

5|$|The IFC prepares {{consolidated}} {{financial statements}} in accordance with United States GAAP which are audited by KPMG. It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009.

5|$|The game {{began with}} a Maryland kickoff to California, who were stopped for <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 4yards and forced to punt. On Maryland's first possession, it mounted a 60-yard drive that culminated in a 24-yard {{touchdown}} rush by Da'Rel Scott. California quarterback Kevin Riley then threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, which allowed Scott to rush for his second score of the game. California made a field goal, but on the following series, Maryland drove 60yards and tight end Dan Gronkowski made a touchdown reception. The Golden Bears made another field goal to end the first half with a score of 21–6, in Maryland's favor. During the second quarter, Riley threw a short screen pass to running back Jahvid Best, who immediately received a hard hit from Maryland cornerback Kevin Barnes. While still lying on the field, Best rolled to his side to vomit. Footage of the tackle and its aftermath circulated widely {{on the internet and}} became a viral video phenomenon. In the third period, Chris Turner completed a pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 27-yard touchdown to end the quarter with Maryland in the lead, 28–6. In the final period, California scored two touchdowns against a preventative defense, before Maryland responded with a fifth score on a one-yard rush by Davin Meggett. In the final minutes, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 27-yard field goal which would have clinched the victory. Instead, California scored a third touchdown to close within eight points. With 1:55 remaining to play, California attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds, and Maryland was able to run out the clock to win the upset, 35–28.|$|E
