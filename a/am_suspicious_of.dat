60|$|A man may be {{an honest}} bullock-contractor, (God forbid {{that many of them}} in this country should not be very honest!) but I find his terms were nearly four times as high as those which the House of Commons had {{condemned}} as exorbitant. They were not only unusually high, but the bullocks were badly supplied, and the contract had not been fairly advertised. It was therefore agreed to declare the same void at the expiration of twelve months, on the 1st December, 1763. I say again, that I do not condemn him for being a bullock-contractor; but I <b>am</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> his honesty, because he has been nursed in bad and vicious habits. That of contracting with his masters is a bad habit, as he himself has stated in a record which is printed by the House of Commons. I condemn him for being a fraudulent bullock-contractor: for he was turned out of that contract for fraudulent practices; it was declared void, and given to another at a lower price. After it was so disposed of, Mr. Hastings himself, condemning his own original contract, which was at twelve rupees for a certain species of bullocks, took the contract again at seven; and on these terms it continued. What I therefore contend for is this, that he carried with him the spirit of a fraudulent bullock-contractor through the whole of the Company's service, in its greatest and most important parts.|$|E

"I <b>am</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> 'generational' {{interpretations of}} politics, but I must confess that {{with regard to}} the Socialist Party in the thirties it is {{impossible}} to avoid at least some generational stress. The clash in style was striking. Not only did the Old Guard treat the ideas of the Militants as a repulsive sort of quasi-Bolshevism; it also found intolerable the enthusiasm of these naive young comrades, their expectation that Norman Thomas booming out the credo of 'socialism in our time' was something to be taken seriously. The youth had entered the movement in the hope of creating a new world, a new life, and now the old-timers came along, grumbling about defeats, mistakes, betrayals. Each generation spoke for its own portion of experience, and only if there had been in this country a line of socialist continuity, so that each generation would not have to start as if from the beginning might this collision have been avoided." ...|$|E
50|$|Hughes's sociological prose is {{original}} in its {{avoidance of}} complex concepts. He never published explicitly theoretical work. However, his essays are analytically dense {{and he often}} discusses the task of sociology more broadly. In his preface for The Sociological Eye, first published in 1971 (transaction edition published in 1984), he describes his approach to sociology with reference to C. Wright Mills's phrase the sociological imagination (Hughes 1984, xvi). In his final paragraphs to that preface he outlines his view of sociology and sociological method:Some say that sociology is a normative science. If they mean that social norms are one of its main objects of study, I agree. If they mean anything else, I do not agree. Many branches of human learning have suffered from taking norms too seriously. Departments of language in universities are often so normative that they kill and pin up their delicate moth of poetry and stuff their beasts of powerful living profes before letting students examine them. Language, as living communication, {{is one of the}} promising fields of study; it is not quite the same as the study of languages. Men constantly make and break norms; there is never a moment when the norms are fixed and unchanging. If they do appear to remain unchanged for some time in some place, that, too, is to be accounted for as much as change itself.Certainly, I have never sat down to write systematically about how to study society. I <b>am</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> any method said to be the one and only. But among the methods I should recommend is the intensive, penetrating look with an imagination as lively and as sociological as it can be made. One of my basic assumptions is that if one quite clearly sees something happen once, it is almost certain to have happened again and again. The burden of proof is on those who claim a thing once seen is an exception; if they look hard, they may find it everywhere, although with some interesting differences in each case.

40|$|As one of {{the younger}} {{scholars}} in religion and science, I have a slightly different perspective on the field, a view not all other scholars in the field may appreciate. My perspective is strongly influenced by European—es-pecially Kantian, hermeneutic, and Wittgensteinian—philosophy. As a consequence I strongly emphasize the difference between science and reli-gion and <b>am</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> attempts to integrate both. Although I am {{in favor of a}} dialogue between science and religion, I often focus on funda-mental issues that I believe are nowadays too often neglected and that I think are crucial {{for the future of the}} field of science and religion. Looking at that field today, I feel a growing unease with the way it is developing, especially in the English-speaking countries. In my book Chaos, Complexity, and God (Smedes 2004) I pinpointed my uneasiness by criti-cally examining the approaches of two highly influential exponents of the contemporary field: John Polkinghorne and the recently deceased Arthur Peacocke. I tried to show that Polkinghorne and Peacocke (but this also pertains to many other scholars in the field today) adhere to a cultural form of scientism that has become part of our cultural heritage as a prod-uct of the conceptual revolution that occurred during the European En-lightenment and that showed a huge esteem for especially physical (Newtonian) science. In everyday life, scientific thinking and a scientific perception of reality has gained prominence over religious ways of seeing and experiencing the world. We do not even notice our scientific bias anymore. Science is considered a priori rational, and theology has to live up to the standards of scientific rationality if it wants to be taken seriously. In such a perspective, I believe theology is not taken seriously as the hermeneutical enterprise that it is. It is seen as a kind of pseudoscience in which talk about God is on the same level as talk about the cat on the mat and the tree in the garden...|$|E
40|$|In {{the decade}} since {{it became a}} {{priority}} on the United States 2 ̆ 7 national agenda, the issue of human trafficking has spawned enduring controversy. New legal definitions of “trafficking” were codified in international and U. S. law in 2000, but what conduct qualifies as “trafficking” remains hotly contested. Despite shared moral outrage over the plight of trafficked persons, debates over whether trafficking encompasses voluntary prostitution continue to rend the anti-trafficking advocacy community - and are as intractable as debates over abortion and other similarly contentious social issues. Attempts to equate trafficking with slavery invite both disdain and favor: they are often rejected for their insensitive and legally inaccurate conflation with transatlantic slavery yet simultaneously embraced for capturing the moral urgency of addressing this human rights problem. The anti-trafficking movement itself has been attacked by those who believe it is built on specious statistics concerning the problem 2 ̆ 7 s magnitude and by others who think it undermines human rights goals by drawing attention away from migrants 2 ̆ 7 rights and efforts to combat slavery in all its contemporary forms. U. S. law and policy have fueled controversy over anti-trafficking strategies, {{both at home and}} abroad. In 2000, the United States led negotiations over a new international law on trafficking, the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (the U. N. Trafficking Protocol). At the same time, the United States enacted a comprehensive domestic law on trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA). Both instruments define trafficking as the movement or recruitment of men, women, or children, using force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjecting them to involuntary servitude or slavery in one or more {{of a wide variety of}} sectors (for example, agriculture, construction, or commercial sex). These legal definitions reflect a concerted effort to move away from traditional perspectives that narrowly defined trafficking as the movement or recruitment of women or girls into the sex sector and toward a broader understanding of the problem as also involving the exploitation of women, men, and children in non-sex sectors. Although trafficking into non-sex sectors arguably accounts for the larger proportion of trafficking activity, anti-trafficking laws and policies - both within the United States and abroad - have nonetheless remained focused on sex-sector trafficking and prostitution. This focus reflects the potent influence of prostitution-reform debates on the anti-trafficking movement. Those debates have embroiled anti-trafficking advocates and policymakers in a struggle over whether prostitution is inherently coercive, and therefore a form of trafficking, or whether the trafficking label should be applied only to instances of forced prostitution. The Bush Administration adopted the former position, marking the increasing influence of the “neo-abolitionists” - an unlikely alliance of feminists, conservatives, and evangelical Christians who have used the anti-trafficking movement to pursue abolition of prostitution around the globe. This Article examines the prostitution-reform debates on U. S. anti-trafficking policy and assesses their effects in the international arena. Part I describes the prostitution-reform debates and their influence on efforts to develop international and U. S. anti-trafficking laws and policies. The discussion spotlights how the prostitution-reform debates have impeded broader efforts by anti-trafficking advocates to prioritize protection of trafficked persons 2 ̆ 7 human rights in the face of the United States 2 ̆ 7 emphasis on an aggressive criminal justice response to trafficking. Part II describes the ways in which the neo-abolitionists have gained dominance during the formative years of global anti-trafficking law and policy development, largely transforming the anti-trafficking movement into an anti-prostitution campaign. The discussion traces how the neo-abolitionists have successfully promoted their anti-prostitution agenda worldwide through targeted legal reforms that condition U. S. financial assistance to governments, NGOs, and government contractors on the recipients 2 ̆ 7 commitment to an anti-prostitution stance. The discussion further illustrates how the neo-abolitionists have shaped common understandings of the problem of human trafficking by deploying a reductive narrative of trafficking that simplistically depicts trafficking as involving women and girls forced into “sexual slavery” by social deviants. This Article argues that this control over the meaning of trafficking has been perhaps the greatest of the neo-abolitionists 2 ̆ 7 gains because it has significantly influenced how anti-trafficking interventions are constructed and implemented on the ground. Part III assesses the consequences of the neo-abolitionists 2 ̆ 7 rise to power in the trafficking field. The discussion highlights how neo-abolitionist legal reforms and the reductive narrative have promoted criminal justice responses that target prostitution and leave unquestioned the exploitative labor practices and migrant abuse that characterize the majority of trafficking cases. Such responses neglect to address the pervasive labor-migration problem resulting from globalization trends that drive lower-income women and men into patterns of risky migration and exploitative informal-sector employment. Moreover, by invoking comparisons to slavery and stereotypes of innocent, naïve Third World women, neo-abolitionist discursive practices sustain a crusader impulse that resists a self-critical evaluation and assessment of the effects of neo-abolitionist policymaking on its target populations. In turn, this impulse has allowed ideology to overshadow social science data [...] both qualitative and quantitative - that call into question the effectiveness of neo-abolitionist strategies in combating prostitution, much less trafficking. This Article does not aim to provide authoritative solutions to the trafficking problem. Nor does it seek to resolve debates over prostitution reform. I share a commitment to ending human trafficking but <b>am</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> simple solutions and anti-trafficking policies not supported by empirical evidence. This perspective leaves me at times at odds with both those who believe that all prostitution is necessarily forced and those who believe that prostitution is just like any other form of work. In my view, both perspectives lack an empirical basis and neither provides a solid foundation for effective anti-trafficking policy. Trafficking is a complicated problem, requiring nuanced solutions that will vary depending on context. This Article instead offers a historical account and critical assessment of the prostitution-reform debates 2 ̆ 7 considerable influence on anti-trafficking law and policy development over the last decade. It does so to expose the difficulties of translating ideology - understood here as closely held moral and ethical beliefs - into effective governance strategies. There is an urgent need to adopt and emphasize policies that are guided foremost by a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that grapples with the real-world complexities of human trafficking. This empirical approach requires us to set aside our narrow ideological commitments and to objectively evaluate the actual impact that “anti-trafficking” interventions have both on those they purport to help and on the vulnerable populations they collaterally affect...|$|E
