40|$|ContextStudents tend to {{postpone}} {{preparation for a}} test until the test is imminent, which raises various risks associated with cramming' behaviours, including that for suboptimal learning. Cumulative assessment utilises spaced testing to stimulate students to study more frequently and to prevent procrastination. This randomised controlled study investigated how cumulative assessment affects time spent on self-study and test performance compared with end-of-course assessment. MethodsA total of 78 undergraduate medical students in a Year 2 pre-clinical course {{were randomly assigned to}} either of two conditions. Students in the cumulative <b>assessment</b> <b>condition</b> were assessed in weeks 4, 8 and 10. Students in the end-of-course <b>assessment</b> <b>condition</b> were assessed in week 10 only. Each week, students reported the number of hours they spent on self-study. ResultsStudents in the cumulative <b>assessment</b> <b>condition</b> (n= 25) spent significantly more time on self-study than students in the end-of-course <b>assessment</b> <b>condition</b> (n= 37) in all weeks of the course except weeks 5, 9 and 10. Overall, the cumulative assessment group spent 69 hours more on self-study during the course than did the control group, although the control group spent 7 hours more in studying during the final week of the course than did the cumulative assessment group. Students in the cumulative <b>assessment</b> <b>condition</b> scored slightly higher on questions concerning the content of {{the last part of the}} course. ConclusionsCumulative assessment encourages students to distribute their learning activities over a course, which leaves them more opportunity to study the content of the last part of the course prior to the final examination. There was no evidence for a short-term effect of cumulative assessment on overall knowledge gain. We hypothesise that larger positive effects might be found if retention were to be measured in the long term. Discuss ideas arising from the article at discuss...|$|R

50|$|The {{manner in}} which a {{training}} study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of expectancy bias relates to placebo effects, which {{is the belief that}} training should have a positive influence on cognition. A control group may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training. Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect. An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability. The study may result in inconsistency if {{there are a variety of}} comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions,</b> training setting and control group selection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focus of}} {{classical}} test theory (CTT) is on determining error of the measurement. Perhaps {{the most famous}} model of CTT is the equation , where X is the observed score, T is the true score, and e is the error involved in measurement. Although e could represent {{many different types of}} error, such as rater or instrument error, CTT only allows us to estimate one type of error at a time. Essentially it throws all sources of error into one error term. This may be suitable in the context of highly controlled laboratory conditions, but variance is a part of everyday life. In field research, for example, it is unrealistic to expect that the conditions of measurement will remain constant. Generalizability theory acknowledges and allows for variability in <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions</b> that may affect measurements. The advantage of G theory {{lies in the fact that}} researchers can estimate what proportion of the total variance in the results is due to the individual factors that often vary in assessment, such as setting, time, items, and raters.|$|E

The differences between the modelsâ€™ predicted scores for students on both the CI and AS for the PPT and CBT conditions were very small, did not consistently favor one <b>assessment</b> <b>condition</b> over the other, and were not statistically significant. These similarities {{indicate that}} instructors and researchers can use online platforms to collect valuable and normalizable information about the impacts of their courses without concerns about the legitimacy of comparing that data to prior research that was collected with paper-and-pencil tests.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{knowledge}} of the technical condition of the water distribution systems (WDS) is a key issue to predict {{the performance of the}} WDS and to optimize maintenance and rehabilitation of the WDS.

30|$|The final {{performance}} model included RBA {{score as}} the outcome variable and predictor variables for posttest (level 1), assessment condition (level 2), and course (level 3) (Eq. 3). The variables {{used in the}} final model are shown in TableÂ  3. We built the model in three steps: (1) a level 1 variable for posttest, (2) then add a level 2 variable for assessment condition, and (3) add level 3 variables for each course. To determine how much variance in the data was explained by each of the variables, we compared the total variance between each of the models. The reduction in the variance between the models indicated {{the strength of the}} relationship between the variables and performance by showing how much information about performance the added variables provided. For example, if there were large differences in performance between PPTs and CBTs, then the addition of CBT to the model would decrease the total variance. One distinction between HLM and OLS regression is that in OLS additional variables always reduce the unexplained variance, whereas in HLM, the variance can increase if a non-significant variable is added to the model (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002, p. 150). We used the hypothesis testing function in the HLM software to generate predicted values and standard error for each of the coursesâ€™ pretest and posttest scores, for both <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions,</b> to inform the size and reliability of any differences between <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
40|$|High-stakes assessments, such the Graduate Records Examination, have transitioned from {{paper to}} {{computer}} administration. Low-stakes Research-Based Assessments (RBAs), {{such as the}} Force Concept Inventory, have only recently begun this transition to computer administration with online services. These online services can simplify administering, scoring, and interpreting assessments, thereby reducing barriers to instructors' use of RBAs. By supporting instructors' objective assessment of the efficacy of their courses, these services can stimulate instructors to transform their courses to improve student outcomes. We investigate {{the extent to which}} RBAs administered outside of class with the online Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform provide equivalent data to tests administered on paper in class, in terms of both student participation and performance. We use an experimental design to investigate the differences between these two <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions</b> with 1, 310 students in 25 sections of 3 college physics courses spanning 2 semesters. Analysis conducted using Hierarchical Linear Models indicates that student performance on low-stakes RBAs is equivalent for online (out-of-class) and paper-and-pencil (in-class) administrations. The models also show differences in participation rates across <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions</b> and student grades, but that instructors can achieve participation rates with online assessments equivalent to paper assessments by offering students credit for participating and by providing multiple reminders to complete the assessment. We conclude that online out-of-class administration of RBAs can save class and instructor time while providing participation rates and performance results equivalent to in-class paper-and-pencil tests...|$|E

30|$|We {{built the}} model in three steps: (1) {{differentiating}} between the pretest and posttest for the CBT and PPT <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions,</b> (2) adding the level 3 predictor {{for the number of}} recommended practices the instructor used, (3) adding level 2 predictor for course grade and gender. On their own, the effect that the different model coefficients have on participation rates is difficult to interpret because they are expressed in logits. Part of the difficulty is that the size of each coefficient cannot be directly compared because the effect of a coefficient on the probability of participation depends on the other coefficients to which it is being added (e.g., the intercept). For example, a logit of 0 is a 50 % probability, 1 is approximately 90 %, and 2 is 99 %. Thus, a 1.0 shift in logits from 0 to 1 is a much larger change in probability than the 1.0 shift from 1 to 2 logits. The importance of the starting point was particularly salient for interpreting the coefficients in our HGLM models because the intercepts for the pre/post <b>assessment</b> <b>conditions</b> varied from a low of âˆ’ 2.7 to a high of 2.3. To simplify interpreting the results of the model, we used the hypothesis testing function in the HLM software to generate predicted logits and standard errors for each of the combinations of variables and converted the logits to probabilities with error bars of 1 standard error. In our analyses, we focused on posttest participation rates because they are the more limiting rates for data collection, and because the posttests contain information about the effects of the course whereas the pretests only contain information about the students who enroll in the course.|$|E
