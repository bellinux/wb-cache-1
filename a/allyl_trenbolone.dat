40|$|Replacement gilts {{frequently}} {{do not fit}} smoothly into existing {{breeding and}} farrowing schedules because time of estrus cannot be predicted. Being able to program replacement gilts into a breeding herd would improve management, so we investigated {{the effectiveness of a}} synthetic progestogen, <b>allyl</b> <b>trenbolone,</b> to control estrus in gilts. <b>Allyl</b> <b>trenbolone</b> is not presently available to swine producers...|$|E
40|$|Control of estrus in gilts is {{theoretically}} {{possible by}} feeding a progestogen for 18 consecutive days. During the feeding period the progestogen suppresses estrus in all gilts and when {{withdrawn from the}} feed, all animals are expected to come in heat 4 to 7 days later. To be useful, the synchronizing agent must meet two criteria: (1) it must effectively control the time of estrus, and (2) it must not adversely affect fertility. We conducted this trial to evaluate a progestogen, <b>allyl</b> <b>trenbolone,</b> with respect to these criteria. <b>Allyl</b> <b>trenbolone</b> is not presently available to swine producers...|$|E
40|$|If gilts {{are known}} to be cyclic, the options to control estrus are breed-and-abort or feeding <b>allyl</b> <b>trenbolone</b> (Regumate®). For breed and abort, {{terminate}} pregnancy 25 – 30 days postbreeding with two injections of prostaglandin F 2 a (PGF 2 a), 6 – 8 hours apart. Gilts should return to estrus within 4 – 6 days with normal fertility. When feeding <b>allyl</b> <b>trenbolone,</b> you must ensure individual feeding so that gilts receive at least 15 mg (Regumate®) per day. There is probably no problem with overdosing, but underdosing (< 13 mg per day) may cause cystic follicles. If gilts {{are known to}} be prepubertal, gonadotropin (PG 600 ®) works well. If inducing estrus with gonadotropin, breed at the induced estrus but expect some possible depression in reproductive performance. If the gilts ’ cyclic status is unknown, gonadotropin can be used but there may be risks. If gilts are having silent heats, cystic follicles may form and the gilts will become infertile—treat for 14 – 18 days with <b>allyl</b> <b>trenbolone</b> followed by gonadotropin at withdrawal. Gonadotropin also works well after weaning of the first litter. ␣ Injection can be administered on the day of, or the day after, weaning. For farrowing induction, determine gestation length on each farm and do not inject PGF 2 a more than 2 days before due date. Inject a half-dose of PGF 2 a intravulvally {{at the beginning and end}} of the day (split-dose). Do not use oxytocin unless at least one pig has been born or continual supervision is practiced...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of prolonged spring oestrus in mares, {{which is often}} associated with multifollicular ovaries (MFO), are described {{in the context of the}} need to produce foals early in the year. The results obtained, in terms of pregnancy and time of ovulation, after the intramuscular administration of a single standard 15 -ml (1500 mg) dose of proligestonea are described and compared with data available for <b>allyl</b> <b>trenbolone,</b> b, which is given orally, and with accepted data for non-medicated mares. It is concluded that proligestone may be useful in treating MFO and that its use may even aid conception. This latter observation is worthy of further investigation...|$|E
