The research adopted the use of quantitative method; and collected data and information from the five regions that make up the province. Both primary and secondary data were collected. The study used correlation analyses to determine the perfect fit or negative fit of some variables to supply chain as well as the consumers‟ reactions to the questionnaires. Gross margin analysis as well as gross profit margin ratio was used to determine the profitability of aquaculture production in the province. Findings of the study revealed underutilization of production capacities of the established fish farms. The fish farmers in the study are currently using 36 % of the capacities of the established <b>aquaculture</b> <b>projects</b> in the study area.
