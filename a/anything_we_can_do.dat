He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you?

2500|$|During late May 1986 (around {{three weeks}} after Lords' 18th birthday), {{authorities}} discovered she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, {{and the general public}} for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested. (See United States v. X-Citement Video) She was taken into protective custody and hired [...] high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney's investigators searched Lords' Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken (she was actually fifteen years of age in the photographs). When investigators used Lords' fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to [...] locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984, and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, [...] "There isn't <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E

With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} substitution of electronic resources for print materials, {{the replacement of}} personal service by desk-top delivery, and the prevailing (false, of course) notion that anyone can successfully search the web for anything, astronomers and students are increasingly bypassing the physical library (including staff) in their research activities.

"Fernan is gone to Milwaukee to get further {{advice and}} more comforts for Gerald, and we mean, {{as soon as}} he can be moved, to take him home with us, since the air of the Rockies will revive him if {{anything}} will. This place is fearfully hot and oppressive; the bay seems to shut out air from Lake Erie, and I cannot bear to think what that poor boy must have gone through in that close little den, with the printing-press humming and stamping away close to him; but he says it is his native element, and that when he is better he must go to Fiddler's Ranch. He sends his love, and fears that you have missed his letters, but he could hardly write them, and thought Lydia might alarm you. He is a very dear boy, and I do hope we make him comfortable; he is so thankful for the little we can do for him, and so patient. He tells me to give special love to Francie, and say he is glad that Mona's game of chess was played out with a good substitute for Ferdinand. These are his words, which no doubt she will understand. We think of moving next week, but much depends on the doctor's verdict. My love too to the dear Francie; she will be a great lady, quite beyond our sphere. Perhaps she may be able to give Emily some amusements, though I fear they will only make her more discontented with our humdrum ways. I never thought hospital work would suit her. Gerald says there is nothing like trying one's theories, and that having to exaggerate his own has made him sick of a good deal of them, though not of all. Poor dear boy, I hope he will live to show the benefits he says he has derived from this sad time.

40|$|When an {{electromagnetic}} acoustic transducer (EMAT) is used {{to generate}} ultrasound in an electrically conducting sample, eddy currents are generated in the sample's skin depth as the first stage in transduction. The resultant acoustic wave amplitude {{is proportional to the}} amplitude of this eddy current, and so <b>anything</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to increase the eddy current will lead to the generation of larger amplitude ultrasonic waves. In eddy current testing, wire coils are often wound onto a ferrite core to increase the generated eddy current, with the effect that inductance of the coil increases greatly. When we are dealing with an EMAT, any increase in the coil inductance is usually unacceptable as it leads to a reduction in the amplitude of a given frequency of eddy current from a limited voltage source. This is particularly relevant where current arises from capacitor discharge, as is typically used in EMAT driver current circuitry. We present a method for electromagnetic acoustic transduction where ferrite {{is used to}} increase eddy current amplitude, without significantly increasing coil inductance or changing the frequency content of the eddy current or the generated acoustic wave. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{ancillary}} {{benefits for}} school kids involved in doing Philosophy for Children {{is that it}} gives them an additional classroom opportunity to read. A number of teachers I’ve worked with have been initially attracted to P 4 C for just this reason. Even if they were initially skeptical {{about the value of}} philosophy, they at least considered it worthwhile that students were being encouragedto explore the written word. And indeed, the value of the reading aspect of P 4 C is not to be underestimated; <b>anything</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to lure kids towards books is, I think, to be commended. Unfortunately, though, lots of kids don’t like to read, don’t read well, or just think that reading is uncool. For these reasons and others, any classroom activity - philosophy or not - that is organized primarily around explorations of textual materials is likely to leave some students by the wayside. As practitioners of Philosophy for Children, therefore, it behooves us to try to developalternative ways of raising philosophical questions, exercises that don’t rely on the written words asa starting point. In this paper, then, I discuss three different strategies I’ve developed to get (mostly) middle school students philosophizing about moral questions. These strategies use exercises - interactivelearning models - as a way to motivate discussions. Two things I need to note in describing them. First, while these examples explore issues in moral philosophy, such activities are not limited to philosophical ethics; I use similar sorts of active learning initiatives to do metaphysics, epistemology, and logic, too. Second, and more importantly, while this paper discusses active learning, I’m not suggesting that this should be the only way we do P 4 C. Such activities ought {{to be part of a}} comprehensive program that includes a good deal of reading and writing, as well...|$|R

It's the same thing whether {{you look at the}} suffrage business or the labour people or at this Irish muddle. People may be too safe. You see we live {{at the end of a}} series of secure generations in which none of the great things of life have changed materially. We've grown up with no sense of danger--that is to say, with no sense of responsibility. None of us, none of us--for though I talk my actions belie me--really believe that life can change very fundamentally any more forever. All this",--Mr. Britling waved his arm comprehensively--"looks as though it was bound to go on steadily forever. It seems incredible that the system could be smashed. It seems incredible that <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> will ever smash the system. Lady Homartyn, for example, is incapable of believing that she won't always be able to have week-end parties at Claverings, and that the letters and the tea won't come to her bedside in the morning. Or if her imagination goes to the point of supposing that some day she won't be there to receive the tea, it means merely that she supposes somebody else will be. Her pleasant butler may fear to lose his 'situation,' but nothing on earth could make him imagine a time when there will not be a 'situation' for him to lose. Old Asquith thinks that we always have got along, and that we always shall get along by being quietly artful and saying, 'Wait and see.' And it's just because we are all convinced that we are so safe against a general breakdown that we are able to be so recklessly violent in our special cases. Why shouldn't women have the vote? they argue. What does it matter? And bang goes a bomb in Westminster Abbey. Why shouldn't Ulster create an impossible position?

40|$|The {{primary role}} {{of the immune system}} is to protect the {{organism}} against pathogens, but age-associated alterations to immunity increase the susceptibility of the elderly to infectious disease. The exact nature of these changes is still controversial, but the use of screening procedures, such as the SENIEUR protocol to exclude underlying illness, helped to better characterize the changes actually related to physiological aging rather than pathology. It is generally agreed that the most marked changes occur in the cellular immune response reflecting profound alterations in T cells. Much of this is due to thymic involution as well as changes in the proportions of T cell subpopulations resulting from antigen exposure, and altered T cell activation pathways. However, a body of data indicates that innate immune responses, including the critical bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, and antigen presenting capacity are not completely resistant to senescence processes. The consequences of all these alterations are an increased incidence of infections, as well as possibly cancers, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory diseases. The leading question is what, if <b>anything,</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> to prevent these deleterious changes without dangerously dysregulating the precarious balance of productive immunity versus immunopathology? There are many potential new therapeutic means now available to modulate immunosenescence and many others are expected to be available shortly. One main problem in applying these experimental therapies is ethical: there is a common feeling that as ageing is not a disease; the elderly are not sick and therefore do not require adventurous therapies with unpredictable side-effects in mostly frail individuals. Animal models are not helpful in this context. In this chapter we will first briefly review what we think we know about human immunosenescence and its consequences for the health status of elderly individuals. We will then discuss possible interventions that might one day become applicable in an appropriate ethical environment...|$|R
40|$|This book is an extensive, {{original}} and systematic treatment of many important philosophical and ethical aspects of food (consumption and production). May <b>we</b> eat just <b>anything?</b> <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> everything with animals, even genetic modification? If not, how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> regulate those processes {{so that they}} lead to optimum animal welfare {{while at the same}} time producing optimum taste? The production of food also causes environmental pollution does the fight against hunger have priority over the care of the environment? The care of the environment, animal welfare, and the quality of food should be in a certain harmony, but that is far from granted and hardly easy to achieve. These factors are often in conflict with each other, and a balance will thus need to be searched for. Other factors to take into consideration are the issue of global famine, the care for a farming class that is able to keep its head above water in a decent way, and a fair trade system that does not throw up unnecessary barriers for newcomers or small market participants and that promotes good nutrition. Famine continues to be a widespread phenomenon that violates human rights, causing nearly a billion people to suffer from hunger or malnutrition. At the same time, deliberate hunger, abundance, and obesity are prevalent in the Western world. Both issues refer to the social and cultural aspects of food. Scientific and technological developments like genetic modification and functional food also play an increasingly important role; almost every bite that we take is determined by scientific developments. An extra difficulty is that scientific information is often contradictory, or that it relies on statistical probabilities that are difficult to translate into everyday certitudes. All of these factors deserve attention, but it is the mix that is most important. In the land of food, either or does not exist, only both and. The adequate measure of both and serves as the starting point for this philosophical reflection...|$|R
