A 36th-level bureaucrat (demoted {{to level}} 37 during the series) <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> he is {{a stickler for}} regulation and enamored of the tedium of paperwork and bureaucracy. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the popular party activity. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died. Hermes has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year-old son, Dwight.|$|E
500|$|Wallenberg {{was aware}} of his one-sixteenth Jewish ancestry, <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It came from his great-great-grandfather (his {{maternal}} grandmother's grandfather) Michael Benedicks, who immigrated to Stockholm in 1780. Professor Ingemar Hedenius (one of the leading Swedish philosophers) recalls a conversation with Raoul dating back to 1930, when they were together in an army hospital during military service: ...|$|E
500|$|Bart's rebellious {{attitude}} {{has made him}} a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and is well aware of it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E

2500|$|An {{eccentric}} <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Ward {{was known}} for pulling an unusual publicity stunt that coincided with a national crisis. Ward bought an island in Minnesota near his home and dubbed it [...] "Moosylvania," [...] based upon {{the home of his}} Bullwinkle TV character. He and publicist Howard Brandy crossed the country in a van, gathering signatures on a petition for statehood [...] for Moosylvania. They then visited Washington, D.C., and attempted to gain an audience with President John F. Kennedy. They arrived at the White House {{during the time of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and were escorted off the grounds at gunpoint.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his spare}} time Rollini {{considered}} himself a [...] "waterbug," [...] <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He owned a 21-foot Chris Craft speedboat and a Chris Craft cruiser, sleeping four. After an exhaustive career he made his last recording with his trio in the early 50s, and then turned his attention fully to the hotel business. He later relocated to Florida, and opened the Eden Roc Hotel in September 1955. He also ran the Driftwood Inn at Tavernier Key. Rollini loved sport-fishing, and his Driftwood offered deep-sea fishing charters. [...] After Rollini's death, it appears his wife Dixie left Florida. The remains of the old Driftwood Inn were completely destroyed in a hurricane that rocked the Florida keys in 1960.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{sides were}} deeply {{unhappy with the}} events of July 1995. Residents were angered that the parade had gone ahead and at {{what they saw as}} unionist triumphalism, while Orangemen and their {{supporters}} were angered that their parade had been held up by an illegal protest. Some Orangemen formed a group called Spirit of Drumcree (SoD) to defend their [...] "right to march". At a SoD meeting in Belfast's Ulster Hall one of the platform speakers said, to applause:Sectarian means you belong to a particular sect or organisation. I belong to the Orange Institution. Bigot means you look after the people you belong to. That's what I'm doing. I'm a sectarian bigot <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesign}} was criticised by {{some for}} having no specifically Welsh symbol (such as the Welsh Dragon), because the Royal Shield {{does not include}} a specifically Welsh symbol. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission [...] "disappointing", and stated {{that he would be}} writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that [...] "the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland." [...] Designer Dent stated [...] "I am a Welshman <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but I never thought about the fact we did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because as far as I am concerned Wales is represented on the Royal Arms. This was never an issue for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1952, while Stevenson {{was still}} {{governor}} of Illinois, President Harry S. Truman {{decided that he}} would not seek another term as president. Instead, Truman met with Stevenson in Washington and proposed that Stevenson seek the Democratic nomination for president; Truman promised him his support if he did so. Stevenson at first hesitated, arguing that he was committed to running for a second gubernatorial term in Illinois. However, a number of his friends and associates (such as George Wildman Ball) quietly began organizing a [...] "draft Stevenson" [...] movement for President; they persisted in their activity even when Stevenson (both publicly and privately) told them to stop. When Stevenson continued to state that he was not a candidate, President Truman and the Democratic Party leadership looked for other prospective candidates. However, each of the other main contenders had a major weakness. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee won most of the presidential primaries and entered the 1952 Democratic National Convention with the largest number of delegates, but he was unpopular with President Truman and other prominent Democrats. In 1950 Kefauver had chaired a Senate committee that traveled to several large cities and held televised hearings into organized crime. The hearings revealed connections between organized-crime syndicates and big-city Democratic political organizations, which led Truman and other Democratic leaders to oppose Kefauver's bid for the nomination: [...] "a machine politician <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> [...] had no use for reformers who blackened the names of fellow Democrats." [...] Truman favored U.S. diplomat W. Averell Harriman, but he had never held elective office and was inexperienced in national politics. Truman next turned to his Vice-President, Alben Barkley, but at 74 years of age he was dismissed as being too old by labor union leaders. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia was popular in the South, but his support of racial segregation and opposition to civil rights for blacks made him unacceptable to Northern and Western Democrats. In the end Stevenson, despite his reluctance to run, remained the most attractive candidate heading into the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.|$|E

He would say so to anybody, <b>and</b> be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He lay with his wife in his arms, and she was still his fulfilment, just the same as ever.
