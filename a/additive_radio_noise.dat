40|$|Our {{goal was}} to measure the {{strength}} of the horizontal electric component of atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> and examine its statistical variation.

40|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>noise</b> {{continuum}} emission observed in metric and decametric wave frequencies is discussed. The <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> {{is associated with}} actively varying sunspot groups accompanied by the S-component of microwave radio emissions. It is shown that the S-component emission in microwave frequencies generally occurs several days before the emission of the noise continuum storms of lower frequencies. It is likely that energetic electrons, 10 to 100 Kev, accelerated {{in association with the}} variation of sunspot magnetic fields, are the sources of the radio emissions. A model is considered to explain the relation of burst storms on <b>radio</b> <b>noise.</b> An analysis of the role of energetic electrons on the emissions of both noise continuum and type III burst storms is presented.

40|$|Field {{intensity}} of atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> on 2. 5 Mc/s was measured {{on board the}} "SOYA" along the course from Tokyo to Antarctica. Results of {{the analysis of the}} measurements are summarized as follows: 1) The daytime noise intensity which is predominant in the tropical region and near South Africa corresponds well to the meteorological situation. 2) Atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> intensity measured on board the "SOYA" agrees well with the values predicted on the "Noise Map" prepared by CRPL and with the result of measurement at the fixed stations (Singapore and Pretoria). 3) Characteristics of the atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> were examined in connection with the solar zenith angle and the latitude. Both the mode of diurnal variation and the relation between absorption and solar zenith angle very distinctly with the latitude. 4) Decrease in the intensity at midnight towards the south from about 32 °S is greater than that of the intensity calculated only from the distance (the so-called unabsorbed field intensity) and smaller than what was predicted on the CRPL 2 ̆ 7 s map. 5) Abnormal enhancement of the <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> was seen when the ship went under the pouring rain, while the noise fell down to zero level with a flash of lightning, and then it rose exponentially with the time constant of the order of 1 minute. These facts seem to suggest the mechanism how the atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> originates in rain falls. In other words, the precipitation noise due to rainfall occurs in the presence of both raindrops and the static field between the earth and the cell of charged clouds...|$|R

5000|$|A {{riometer}} (commonly relative ionospheric opacity meter, although originally: Relative Ionospheric Opacity Meter for Extra-Terrestrial Emissions of <b>Radio</b> <b>noise)</b> is {{an instrument}} used {{to quantify the}} amount of electromagnetic-wave ionospheric absorption in the atmosphere. As the name implies, a riometer measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} ionospheric absorption, this <b>radio</b> <b>noise,</b> averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the theoretical analysis of radio interference from high voltage transmission lines. In particular it examines {{the relation between}} the far and near fields of <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> emanating from power lines under corona. A method is proposed for predicting far fields of <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> from measurements and analysis of near fields. The near field of <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> from a power line is nearly quasi-stationary and affects ordinary communication receivers. The far field is predominantly a radiation field which may be of sufficient magnitude to interfere with receivers with sensitive directional antennas. This far field has been virtually ignored in previous radio interference studies, as has, consequently, the problem of relating it to the near field. The prediction of far fields from near-field measurements, besides being theoretically interesting, is useful for purposes of determining distant fields of corona <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> which are difficult to measure but perceptible on antennas of radio receiving stations. The first part of this thesis contains a systematic development of the basic theory in radio interference analysis. The rest of the thesis deals with the particular problem of near and far field relations. Most of the work described here is theoretical in nature and should be regarded as laying the groundwork for more extensive analyses supported by a liberal amount of experimental data. Some experimental results, representing a partial support of the theory, are described. Suggested methods of further experimental confirmation are outlined.
