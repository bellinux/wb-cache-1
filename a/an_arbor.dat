5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on <b>an</b> <b>arbor.</b> Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to <b>an</b> <b>arbor</b> press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
25|$|A {{table saw}} or {{sawbench}} is a woodworking tool, {{consisting of a}} circular saw blade, mounted on <b>an</b> <b>arbor,</b> that is driven by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through {{the surface of a}} table, which provides support for the material, usually wood, being cut.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAxonal and {{dendritic}} arbors can {{be characterized}} statistically by their spatial density function, a function that specifies the probability of finding a branch of <b>a</b> particular <b>arbor</b> at each point in a neural circuit. Based on an analysis of over <b>a</b> thousand <b>arbors</b> from many neuron types in various species, we have discovered an unexpected simplicity in arbor structure: all of the arbors we have examined, both axonal and dendritic, can be described by a Gaussian density function truncated at about two standard deviations. Because all arbors are characterized by density functions with this single functional form, only four parameters are required to specify <b>an</b> <b>arbor's</b> size and shape: the total length of its branches and the standard deviations of the Gaussian in three orthogonal directions. This simplicity in arbor structure can have implications for the developmental wiring of neural circuits...|$|R

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on <b>an</b> <b>arbor</b> infelix ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment {{in accordance with the}} custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase infelix lignum (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright stipes.|$|E

[...] G.W.P Custis moved onto the estate in 1802, and between 1802 and 1818 constructed Arlington House. [...] Custis also extensively developed the estate grounds. [...] Much of the steep slope to the east of the house became a cultivated English landscape park, while a large flower garden with <b>an</b> <b>arbor</b> was constructed and planted south of the house.|$|E
