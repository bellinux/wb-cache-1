5|$|Rubin delayed in {{offering}} Kinkladze a contract extension, leading Anorthosis {{to make an}} attempt to re-sign him early in the pre-season, but Kinkladze rejected the offer as he wished to stay at Rubin.

5|$|Born in Brussels on 15 September 1505, between ten {{and eleven}} in the morning, Archduchess Mary of Austria {{was the fifth}} child of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile. Her birth was very difficult; the Queen's life was in danger <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> her a month to recover. On 20 September, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her {{paternal}} grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, {{who had died in}} 1482.

5|$|Clemson fielded the {{following}} kickoff, and its offense continued {{with the success}} it found in its final drive of the first half. As in that drive, C. J. Spiller was a key performer. Clemson's drive began at its 40-yard line, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> just five plays for the Tigers to score a touchdown. Four of those plays, including the culminating one, came from Spiller, who covered 40 yards during them. Spiller's touchdown cut Georgia Tech's lead to 23–20. But as quickly as Clemson scored, Georgia Tech moved even more quickly. From its 30-yard line, the Yellow Jackets needed only three plays, the keystone coming on a 70-yard throw from Nesbitt to Thomas for a touchdown. With 5:10 remaining in the quarter, the Yellow Jackets restored the 10-point margin, 30–20.|$|E
50|$|This {{mountain}} is very {{famous for the}} beautiful frost patterns that form on trees in winter and so attract many climbers. There are several routes to reach the top; one is from Takami-Otoge Pass <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> about one hour; another route is from Takami-tozanguchi Bus Stop on the Nara Kotsu bus route, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> two <b>and</b> a half hours.

5|$|During his spell in Sauber, in the 1991 Sportscar World Championship, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a serious incident with Derek Warwick in that year's 430 km of Nürburgring. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> intervention from Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> {{several days before}} they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the outside world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E

5|$|The first {{pavilion}} {{was designed}} by architect C.H. Strange. It was built in 1903 {{at a cost of}} £1,200 and was destroyed in a suffragette arson attack in April 1913. During the First World War, the Nevill Ground was requisitioned by the British army to graze cavalry horses. This damaged the pitch <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> a few years for it to recover. During the Second World War, the Nevill Ground was again requisitioned for military purposes, this time to hold soldiers. In 1946, ownership of the ground was transferred from the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club to Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.|$|E

Their breakthrough album, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It Kills Me (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth album, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group {{and was replaced by}} Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when Arthur Brittan {{drowned in}} the Avon River while {{learning}} to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> a half-hour for his body to be recovered. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and {{there are indications that}} he went through a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker, and even put Linwood House up for sale, though no property transaction was recorded.|$|E

Implacable departed six days later to join the BPF and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 25 March. While passing through the Suez Canal, a strong gust of wind forced her ashore <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> her escorting tugboats five hours to pull her off. Undamaged, she proceeded on her voyage and reached Sydney on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day).|$|E
5|$|An attack {{had been}} planned for 18 September but was {{postponed}} due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to high ground that was known as Factory Corner. The high ground was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it {{under the cover of}} a creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> an extra day before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade's Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L'Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E
