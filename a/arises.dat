50|$|The <b>Arisen</b> {{arrives at}} the Tainted Mountain to fight Grigori, and is {{presented}} with a choice, to sacrifice the kidnapped love interest, or to face the dragon. The <b>Arisen</b> fights the dragon, and stabs it in the heart. The <b>Arisen</b> recovers their heart, {{and goes back to}} Cassardis with his/her beloved. After a few days of peace, the <b>Arisen</b> treks back to Gran Soren. Along the way, several details are revealed. The sky has been blotted out and replaced with greenish gray clouds that rain ash, and all normal monsters have been replaced with much stronger versions. After the <b>Arisen</b> reaches Gran Soren, it is revealed that half of it has collapsed, leaving a gaping hole. The <b>Arisen</b> goes to meet the duke, and is surprised to see that the duke has turned into a frail old man. It is revealed that the duke made a deal with Grigori to make himself immortal, but without Grigori, the deal is now forfeited. The duke attacks, blaming the <b>Arisen</b> for his condition, but he is swiftly beaten. Guards arrive, and the duke accuses the <b>Arisen</b> of placing a curse on him and of making a deal with Grigori. The <b>Arisen</b> is then hunted by the guards. The <b>Arisen</b> is chased to the hole in the town, where creatures begin to fly out of the hole, with one bumping the <b>Arisen</b> into the hole.|$|R
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often <b>arises</b> in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it <b>arises</b> more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E

5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability.

Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability <b>arises</b> when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
