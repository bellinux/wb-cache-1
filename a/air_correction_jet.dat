40|$|Abstract: Three aspects, {{such as the}} {{optimization}} of {{calculation model}} for the minimum gas injection rate, the effect of elevation on the minimum gas injection rate, the effect of air humidity on the minimum gas injection rate, have been reviewed in this paper. Considering the influence of altitude and <b>air</b> humidity, <b>correction</b> factor for gas injection rate is calculated. The value of gas injection for altitude correction factor generally increases {{with the increase in}} altitude, especially when conducting air drilling in high altitude areas of western China the correction factor of Qinghai oilfield can be calculated as high as 1. 5. When the air humidity increases, the gas injection humidity correction factor also increases; especially before raining in summer, the <b>air</b> humidity <b>correction</b> factor can be close to 1. 1, under the condition of relatively high air humidity and temperature. In the light of the calculation result and example analysis, it can be found that combining with this article’s altitude and <b>air</b> humidity <b>correction,</b> the result of the amended minimum kinetic energy standard using Boyun Guo’s correlation is the closest to the actual one, which can be used for the calculation of the minimum gas injection rate in industry practice while other methods have relatively larger errors...|$|R

Measurements were made with 2 types of chamber. Firstly measurements were made with a 100 cm" 3 spherical graphite transfer chamber and then measurements were repeated using a 1. 79 cm" 3 cylindrical cavity chamber which is one of a set of 3 chambers which form the primary standard for " 6 " 0 Co and " 1 " 3 " 7 Cs maintained by the NPL. As both these chambers were originally intended for use with photons of higher energies the graphite caps of the chambers provide a sufficient build up region to develop charged particle equilibrium. The " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source used is a pellet encapsulated in a stainless steel casing, with diameter 1. 1 mm and length 5 mm. The source was exposed using a High Dose Rate (HDR) microSelectron brachytherapy unit manufactured by Nucletron.
