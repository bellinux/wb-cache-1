30|$|In {{the context}} of the RCPSP, the serial {{schedule}} generation scheme (SSGS) is widely used to decode a solution representation based on an <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> λ into a schedule, see Kolisch and Hartmann (1999), p. 150 ff. In an <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> λ, all jobs (including the dummy activities) are included once. If an activity i in the project has to precede another activity j, then this order has to be respected in the <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> as well. Hence, the first and last entries of the <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> are always the (dummy) start and end activities. Using the SSGS, one iteratively schedules activities in the order implied by the <b>activity</b> <b>list.</b> Starting with the first <b>activity</b> on this <b>list</b> λ, one determines its earliest starting point that is feasible both with respect to capacity constraints and activity precedence relations.|$|R
30|$|All our {{solution}} representations contain <b>activity</b> <b>lists</b> as {{a substantial}} element. We construct each <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> {{in the initial}} population step by step, starting with the first position of that list. For each position, we determine the set of activities j ∈D {{that have not yet}} been assigned to the <b>activity</b> <b>list,</b> while all immediate predecessor activities i ∈ P_j have already been assigned to that particular <b>list.</b> Each such <b>activity</b> j ∈D can hence be selected for the currently considered position of the <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> without violating any precedence constraint between activities. One of these activities j ∈D is chosen randomly following a distribution, where the selection probability positively correlates with the priority value of that activity (biased sampling). The chosen activity is then appended to the <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> and this procedure repeats until all activities are included.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a new representation for the solu-tions of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) denoted <b>Activity</b> Set <b>List.</b> The most efficient heuristics for the prob-lem use the <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> representation and the serial SGS method {{to construct the}} corresponding solution (schedule). The <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> may induce a search space of representations much larger then the space of schedules because the same schedule can correspond to many different <b>activity</b> <b>list</b> representations. We indicate how the <b>activity</b> set <b>list</b> rep-resentation can significantly reduce the search space, and how to move more efficiently through it. Furthermore, this new representation never excludes the optimal solution and it has many interesting properties. An evaluation of the search space reduction induced by this represen-tation is made for the most used library of instances in the literature.

40|$|Background: There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} that the treatment of patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) should target increasing patients’ involvement in alternative pleasant reinforcers that compete with the reinforcing effects of substance use. The present cross-sectional study sought to identify factors that promote or impede engaging in pleasant activities. Methods: Patients with SUDs (N = 265) were assessed at treatment entry on sociodemographic characteristics, primary type of substance (ie, alcohol or illicit drugs), addiction severity, craving, personality factors, and psychiatric distress. Results: Regression analyses identified dissimilar predictor sets underlying frequency, enjoyability, and cross-product ratings, highlighting the multifaceted behavioral nature of activity engagement. Personality measures showed the strongest associations with patients’ activity engagement, with extraversion as the key predictor. Conclusions: The present findings emphasize the complexity of patients’ involvement in pleasant non–substance-related activities and further investigation is necessary to gain more insight into the underlying mechanisms of activity engagement.

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries {{have recognized the}} need for comprehensive national reforms and comprehensive prevention, treatment, and care and support initiatives to reduce future transmission of and to meet the growing demand for HIV/AIDS services. As a part of these national health reform initiatives, governments are exploring ways to allocate resources in the most efficient and effective way to mitigate the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, many countries lack information on the level {{and nature of the}} costs of HIV/AIDS programs. This document provides an introduction to the procedure for calculating and analyzing the costs of HIV/AIDS programs and describes how to measure directly the actual costs of a program that is up and running. The step-by-step guide is intended to provide project managers in the field with a framework for how to do measure costs for a single, recent year in the life of an HIV/AIDS program.

40|$|Assessment of {{impairment}} and function {{is essential in}} order to monitor joint status and evaluate therapeutic interventions in patients with haemophilia. The improvements {{in the treatment of}} haemophilia have required the development of more sensitive tools to detect the more minor dysfunctions that may now be apparent. This paper outlines some of the recent developments in this field. The Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) provides a systematic and robust measure of joint impairment. The MRI Scoring System has been designed to provide a comprehensive scoring system combining both progressive and additive scales. The Functional Independence Score for Haemophilia (FISH) has been developed to assess performance of functional activities and can be used in conjunction with the Haemophilia <b>Activities</b> <b>List</b> (HAL) which provides a self report measure of function. It is recommended that both measures are evaluated as these tools measure different constructs. Further refinement and testing of the psychometric properties of all of these tools is in progress. More widespread use of these tools will enable the sharing of data across the world so promoting best practice and ultimately enhancing patient car...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In general, {{patients}} with ongoing substance use disorders {{are associated with}} a reduced level of engagement in nonsubstance-related pleasant activities and impaired well-being. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the value of the Pleasant <b>Activities</b> <b>List</b> (PAL) and Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) Happiness Scale to detect changes in a clinical outpatient sample of alcohol-dependent individuals. Methods: By means of a pretreatment and posttreatment design, 34 actively drinking alcohol-dependent participants were consecutively enrolled in this study and referred to a 6 -week outpatient CRA program that was focused on sustained abstinence. The PAL and the CRA Happiness Scale were administered to examine the value of both instruments in relation to treatment outcome. Results: The results indicate that both instruments were characterized by overall satisfactory internal consistencies and yielded robust improvements on virtually all subscales and thus were considered highly 'sensitive' to detect changes between baseline and 1 month follow-up measurement. Moreover, the moderate and in general positive relationships among the subscales of the PAL and the Happiness Scale support the notion that the increase in rewarding activities is associated with improvements on well being and quality of life. Conclusions: Owing to the relatively low response costs, both instruments seem to be viable to adopt in program evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Obesity is a {{major health}} concern {{not only in the}} general {{population}} but also in patients with haemophilia. Little is known about the consequences of obesity for haemophilia patients. As obesity is an important risk factor for osteoarthritis, these effects may be even more pronounced in haemophilia patients who are prone to joint damage. The association between obesity and limitations in daily activities as well as the frequency of bleeds and use of factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate in obese and normal weight haemophilia patients was assessed. Fifteen obese (BMI >= 30 kg m- 2) and fifteen normal weight (BMI < 25 kg m- 2) haemophilia A patients matched for severity and age were analysed. The Hemophilia <b>Activities</b> <b>List</b> (HAL) was used to assess the impairment in daily activities. Compared with the normal weight haemophilia patients, obese haemophiliacs had a significantly lower sum score (88 / 100 and 98 / 100, respectively, P = 0. 02), which was mainly caused by an impaired lower limb function. All other components of the HAL also showed lower scores in the obese patients, but did not reach statistical significance. A higher frequency of bleeds requiring treatment with FVIII concentrate occurred in the obese haemophiliacs (17 bleeds in eight individuals) compared with the controls (three bleeds in three individuals) (P = 0. 045). Compared with non-obese haemophilia patients, obese haemophiliacs had more joint bleeds and a lower overall HAL score, which was driven by a lower limb function score. Prevention of overweight and weight reduction requires special attention from physicians treating haemophilia patient...|$|E
40|$|Prophylaxis is the {{recommended}} treatment {{for children with}} severe haemophilia A, but whether prophylaxis should be continued in adulthood is still under debate. Previous studies with limited follow-up have suggested that some patients {{may be able to}} stop prophylaxis in adulthood, while maintaining good joint health. This single-centre observational cohort study examined patients with severe haemophilia A born 1970 – 1988 without inhibitor development, and assessed the long-term consequences of discontinuing prophylaxis. Patient-initiated changes in prophylaxis, including all switches to on-demand treatment lasting a minimum of two consecutive weeks, were recorded from the time self-infusion began until the last evaluation. Sixty-six patients were evaluated at a median age of 32. 4 years: 26 % of patients had stopped prophylaxis for a median of 10 years, 15 % had interrupted prophylaxis and 59 % had continued prophylaxis. Annual joint bleeding rate (AJBR), Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS- 2. 1; 0 – 124 points), radiological Pettersson score (0 – 78 points) and Haemophilia <b>Activities</b> <b>List</b> score (HAL; 100 – 0 points) were compared between patients who stopped and patients who continued prophylaxis. Although self-reported bleeding rates and functional limitations were similar in both groups (AJBR: 1. 5 vs 1. 2 and HAL: 84 vs 84 for those who stopped and continued prophylaxis, respectively), objective assessment of joint status showed increased arthropathy after 10 years of on-demand treatment in patients who stopped prophylaxis compared with those who continued (HJHS: 23 vs. 14 and Pettersson: 16 vs 5, respectively; P< 0. 01). These results support continuation of long-term prophylaxis in adults and demonstrate the need for objective monitoring of joint status...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{clinical}} outcome after joint bleeding {{is essential to}} identify joint damage and optimise treatment, to prevent disability. However, disease-specific tools to assess the musculoskeletal status in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) are lacking. We aimed to determine validity and reliability of the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) and Haemophilia <b>Activities</b> <b>List</b> (HAL) in patients with Von Willebrand disease (VWD). Ninety-six patients with VWD were included (mean age 46 years) of whom 27 had more than five documented joint bleeds. The HJHS was performed in all patients and all patients completed the HAL and Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA) questionnaires. Health-related quality of life (SF 36) results {{were obtained from the}} prior ‘Willebrand in the Netherlands’ study. Joint X-rays of knees, elbows and ankles were scored according to Pettersson (PS). Internal consistency of the HJHS (Cronbach’s α (α) = 0. 75) and HAL (α= 0. 89) were good. Inter-observer agreement of the HJHS was good (ICC 0. 84; Limits of Agreement ± 10. 3). The HJHS showed acceptable correlation with the X-ray PS (Spearman’s r (r(s)) > 0. 60 all joints) and HAL (r(s) = 0. 71). The HAL also showed acceptable correlation with the SF 36 physical functioning (r(s) = 0. 65) and IPA (r(s) = 0. 69). Hypothesis testing showed adequate discriminative power of both instruments: in patients with a history of > 5 versus ≤ 5 joint bleeds (median HJHS 10 vs 2 (p< 0. 01); median HAL 77 vs 98 (p< 0. 01)), independent from age. In conclusion, both the HJHS and HAL are feasible to assess clinical outcome after joint bleeds in VWD...|$|E

30|$|Note {{that the}} list variable, i.e., the <b>activity</b> <b>list,</b> is not {{guaranteed}} to be topologically ordered after a position swap performed by LocalSolver. There {{are two ways to}} resolve this issue. First, one could add an additional constraint to the model, which enforces that <b>list</b> elements (i.e., <b>activities)</b> can only occur at a certain list position if all predecessors are at earlier positions on that list. In this case, the local search via the LocalSolver engine is forced to generate only feasible <b>activity</b> <b>lists.</b> Alternatively, one could omit this constraint and instead modify the decoding procedure to be usable with all possible permutations. To this end, it is sufficient to delay scheduling an <b>activity</b> on the <b>list</b> until all its immediate predecessors have been scheduled when decoding the <b>activity</b> <b>list.</b> Numerical experiments show that the second option is more efficient on average, because LocalSolver performs worse when using a model with order constraints. This negative effect overcompensates the advantage of the topologically ordered list.|$|R
