It has been shown that the <b>adjuvanticity</b> effect of an injection of pertussis lasts for only a few days, although the effect of such an injection of pertussis on phagocytosis of carbon particles does not reach a maximum until 2 weeks after the injection. The dose-effectiveness of alum precipitated (highly phagocytosable) bovine γ-globulin was greatly increased by the intraperitoneal injection of pertussis. The evidence is considered to be incompatible with increased phagocytosis being either an essential factor in the role of pertussis as a conventional adjuvant, or in the <b>adjuvanticity</b> effect of pertussis...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli (E. coli) heat-labile toxin (LT) is {{a potent}} mucosal {{immunogen}} and immunoadjuvant towards co-administered antigens. LT is composed of one copy of the A subunit, which has ADP-ribosylation activity, and a homopentamer of B subunits, which has affinity for the toxin receptor, the ganglioside G(M 1). Both the ADP-ribosylation activity of LTA and G(M 1) binding of LTB have been proposed {{to be involved in}} immune stimulation. We investigated the roles of these activities in the immunogenicity of recombinant LT or LTB upon intranasal immunization of mice using LT/LTB mutants, lacking either ADP-ribosylation activity, G(M 1) -binding affinity, or both. Likewise, the adjuvant properties of these LT/LTB variants towards influenza virus subunit antigen were investigated. With respect to the immunogenicity of LT and LTB, we found that G(M 1) -binding activity is essential for effective induction of anti-LTB antibodies. On the other hand, an LT mutant lacking ADP-ribosylation activity retained the immunogenic properties of the native toxin, indicating that ADP ribosylation is not critically involved. Whereas <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LTB was found to be directly related to G(M 1) -binding activity, <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LT was found to be independent of G(M 1) -binding affinity. Moreover, a mutant lacking both G(M 1) -binding and ADP-ribosylation activity, also retained <b>adjuvanticity.</b> These results demonstrate that neither ADP-ribosylation activity nor G(M 1) binding are essential for <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LT, and suggest an ADP-ribosylation-independent adjuvant effect of the A subunit...|$|E

In this paper, effects of type of polysaccharide {{and nature of}} oil on <b>adjuvanticity,</b> reactogenicity and stability are described. SL-derivatives of the following polysaccharides were synthesised: synthetic polysucroses with weight-average molecular weight (MW) of 400, 000 (Ficoll 400), 70, 000 (Ficoll 70) and 39, 000 Da (Ficoll 39), polyfructose of 5, 000 Da (inulin), linear polyglucose of 1, 200 Da (maltodextrin) and cyclic polyglucose of 1, 135 Da (beta-cyclodextrin). The number of sulphate groups per monosaccharide of the different SL- polysaccharides varied between 0. 15 and 0. 23 {{and the number of}} lipid groups per monosaccharide between 1. 15 and 1. 29. Adjuvant formulations were prepared by incorporating these SL-polysaccharides into oil-in-water emulsions of either squalane, hexadecane, soya oil or mineral oil. <b>Adjuvanticity</b> of the formulations obtained for humoral responses to inactivated pseudorabies virus (PRV) and inactivated influenza virus strains A/Swine (A/Swine) and MRC- 11 (MRC- 11) in pigs and MRC- 11 and ovalbumin (OVA) in mice depended on the type of oil (squalane = mineral oil > hexadecane = soya oil) but not on the type of polysaccharide backbone of the SL-derivative. Reactogenicity assessed by local swelling in mice decreased with decreasing MW (SL-Ficoll 400 = Ficoll 70 = Ficoll 39 > SL-inulin = SL-mattodextrin > SL-cyclodextrin) when combined with squalane and decreased with the type of oil in the following order: squalane > mineral oil > hexadecane > soya oil when combined with SL- Ficoll 400. Stability of the SL-polysaccharide/squalane/W emulsions at elevated temperature increased with decreasing MW of the SL-polysaccharide (SL-Ficoll 400 2. 5 years at 4 °C, > 18 weeks at 37 °C and > 10 days at 60 °C. We concluded that reactogenicity and stability but not <b>adjuvanticity</b> of SL- polysaccharide/squalane/W formulations depended on the MW of SL- polysaccharide and that SL-cyclodextrin/squalane/W is a promising non- mineral oil adjuvant as it combines strong <b>adjuvanticity</b> (i. e. better than the mineral oil-based adjuvant presently applied) with low reactogenicity and good stability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the effect}} of {{liposomal}} lipid composition on the physicochemical characteristics and <b>adjuvanticity</b> of liposomes was investigated. Using a design of experiments (DoE) approach, peptide-containing liposomes containing various lipids (EPC, DOPE, DOTAP and DC-Chol) and peptide concentrations were formulated. Liposome size and zeta potential were determined for each formulation. Moreover, the <b>adjuvanticity</b> of the liposomes was assessed in an in vitro dendritic cell (DC) model, by quantifying the expression of DC maturation markers CD 40, CD 80, CD 83 and CD 86. The acquired data of these liposome characteristics were successfully fitted with regression models, and response contour plots were generated for each response factor. These models were applied to predict a lipid composition {{that resulted in a}} liposome with a target zeta potential. Subsequently, the expression of the DC maturation factors for this lipid composition was predicted and tested in vitro; the acquired maturation responses corresponded well with the predicted ones. These results show that a DoE approach can be used to screen various lipids and lipid compositions, and to predict their impact on liposome size, charge and <b>adjuvanticity.</b> Using such an approach may accelerate the formulation development of liposomal vaccine adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli heat-labile {{enterotoxin}} (LT) {{is known}} for its potent mucosal immunoadjuvant activity towards co-administered antigens. LT is composed of one A subunit, which has ADP-ribosylation activity, and a homopentameric B subunit, which has high affinity for the toxin receptor, ganglioside G(M 1). In previous studies, we have investigated the role of the LTA and LTB subunits in the <b>adjuvanticity</b> of CT towards influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), administered intranasally to mice. We now studied the adjuvant properties of LT and LT variants towards keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), which, in contrast to HA, does not bind specifically to mucosal surfaces. It is demonstrated that LT mutants without ADP-ribosylation activity, as well as LTB, retain mucosal immunoadjuvant activity when administered intranasally to mice in conjunction with KLH. As with influenza HA, <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LTB required G(M 1) -binding activity, whereas G(M 1) -binding was not essential for adjuvant activity of LT. Furthermore, we found that also recombinant LTA alone acts as a potent mucosal adjuvant, and that this <b>adjuvanticity</b> is independent of ADP-ribosylation activity. It is concluded that binding of the antigen to mucosal surfaces does not play an essential role in the immunostimulation by LT and LT variants, and that both recombinant LTA and LTB represent powerful nontoxic mucosal adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|Heat-labile Escherichia coli {{enterotoxin}} (LT) has {{the innate}} property {{of being a}} strong mucosal immunogen and adjuvant. In the attempt to reduce toxicity and maintain the useful immunological properties, several LT mutants have been produced. Some of these are promising mucosal adjuvants. However, so far, only those that were still toxic maintained full <b>adjuvanticity.</b> In this paper we describe a novel LT mutant with greatly reduced toxicity that maintains most of the <b>adjuvanticity.</b> The new mutant (LTR 72), that contains a substitution Ala [...] > Arg in position 72 of the A subunit, showed only 0. 6 % of the LT enzymatic activity, was 100, 000 -fold less toxic than wild-type LT in Y 1 cells in vitro, and was at least 20 times less effective than wild-type LT in the rabbit ileal loop assay in vivo. At a dose of 1 microg, LTR 72 exhibited a mucosal <b>adjuvanticity,</b> similar to that observed with wild-type LT, better than that induced by the nontoxic, enzymatically inactive LTK 63 mutant, and much {{greater than that of}} the recombinant B subunit. This trend was consistent for both the amounts and kinetics of the antibody induced, and priming of antigen-specific T lymphocytes. The data suggest that the innate high <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LT derives from the independent contribution of the nontoxic AB complex and the enzymatic activity. LTR 72 optimizes the use of both properties: the enzymatic activity for which traces are enough, and the nontoxic AB complex, the effect of which is dose dependent. In fact, in dose-response experiments in mice, 20 microg of LTR 72 were a stronger mucosal adjuvant than wild-type LT. This suggests that LTR 72 may be an excellent candidate to be tested in clinical trials...|$|E

Antigen-specific immune responses in mice were evaluated using ELISA, ELISpot, and flow cytometry assay. Adjuvants&# 39; action modes were investigated by determining antigen persistence at injection sites, local inflammation response, antigen transport into draining lymph node, and activation of DCs in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs).

PLA microparticles augmented both humoral immune response and cell-mediated-immunity which might enhance cross-protection of influenza vaccine. With regard to action mode, alum adjuvant functions by improving antigen persistence at injection sites, inducing severe local inflammation, slightly improving antigen transport into draining lymph nodes, and improving the expression of MHC II on DCs in SLOs.

Commercial recombinant protein hepatitis B vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant is facing low induction of immunity in some sections of the vaccinated population. To follow the current global efforts in finding more potent hepatitis B vaccine formulation, <b>adjuvanticity</b> of aluminum phosphate has been compared to aluminum hydroxide. Materials and methods: The adjuvant properties of aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate in a vaccine formulation containing a locally manufactured hepatitis B (HBs) surface antigen was evaluated in Balb/C mice.

The geometric mean of antibody titer of aluminum phosphate was approximately three folds more than aluminum hydroxide.

The reasons for using the s. c. route are discussed. PV, besides enhancing the hemagglutinin response, also markedly {{increased the number of}} plaque-forming cells in the draining lymph nodes. A heated preparation of PV was tested and found to possess significant adjuvant activity. Interestingly, the enhancement occurred in the absence of marked enlargement of the lymph nodes, which was characteristic of the unheated preparation. In addition, a crude solubilized cell-free preparation of PV was tested and also found to possess significant adjuvant activity. The activity was only partially abolished by heat. Hence, it was concluded that both heat-labile as well as heat-stable factors contributed to the <b>adjuvanticity</b> of PV. The studies also support the view that the draining lymph nodes represent a principal locus of action of PV and that the s. c. route of administration of adjuvant and antigen provides a suitable model for studying and assaying the <b>adjuvanticity</b> of PV...|$|E

40|$|The <b>adjuvanticity</b> of {{bacterial}} adenylate cyclase toxins has been ascribed to their capacity, largely mediated by cAMP, to modulate APC activation, {{resulting in the}} expression of Th 2 -driving cytokines. On the other hand, cAMP has been demonstrated to induce a Th 2 bias when present during T cell priming, suggesting that bacterial cAMP elevating toxins may directly affect the Th 1 /Th 2 balance. Here we have investigated the effects on human CD 4 (+) T cell differentiation of two adenylate cyclase toxins, Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (ET) and Bordetella pertussis CyaA, which differ in structure, mode of cell entry, and subcellular localization. We show that low concentrations of ET and CyaA, but not of their genetically detoxified adenylate cyclase defective counterparts, potently promote Th 2 cell differentiation by inducing expression of the master Th 2 transcription factors, c-maf and GATA- 3. We also present evidence that the Th 2 -polarizing concentrations of ET and CyaA selectively inhibit TCR-dependent activation of Akt 1, which is required for Th 1 cell differentiation, while enhancing the activation of two TCR-signaling mediators, Vav 1 and p 38, implicated in Th 2 cell differentiation. This is at variance from the immunosuppressive toxin concentrations, which interfere with the earliest step in TCR signaling, activation of the tyrosine kinase Lck, resulting in impaired CD 3 zeta phosphorylation and inhibition of TCR coupling to ZAP- 70 and Erk activation. These results demonstrate that, notwithstanding their differences in their intracellular localization, which result in focalized cAMP production, both toxins directly affect the Th 1 /Th 2 balance by interfering with the same steps in TCR signaling, and suggest that their <b>adjuvanticity</b> is likely to result from their combined effects on APC and CD 4 (+) T cells. Furthermore, our results strongly support the key role of cAMP in the <b>adjuvanticity</b> of these toxins...|$|E

30|$|The Ag {{retention}} hypothesis, was not substantiated by subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization of mice with radioactively (14 C)-labeled TT adsorbed to AP adjuvant (Gupta et al. 1996). Subsequently, a {{study was}} conducted to show the relation between Ag retention at the site of injection and Ab titers in rat sera 5  weeks after primary immunization and 2  weeks after boost (Noe et al. 2010). In this study, rats were injected with 111 In-labelled alpha casein (IDCAS) Ag adsorbed to AH or IDCAS adsorbed to AP or non-adsorbed IDCAS Ag formulated in phosphate-treated AP (PTAP) or IDCAS solution by s.c. route. They observed Ag retention in the following order IDCAS[*]+[*]AH[*]>[*]IDCAS[*]+[*]AP[*]>[*]PTAP[*]=[*]IDCAS and the Ab titers in the order PTAP[*]=[*]IDCAS[*]+[*]AP[*]>[*]IDCAS[*]+[*]AH>[*]>[*]IDCAS suggesting an inverse correlation between retention and Ab titer (Noe et al. 2010). This study and that of de Veer and colleagues summarized that alum reduces the amount of soluble Ag entering afferent vessels, although their <b>adjuvanticity</b> was not found to be correlated with slow Ag release (de Veer et al. 2010; Noe et al. 2010). Thus, in vivo dispensability of strong adsorption, retention, and slow release of Ag by alum in Ab response indicates that other mechanisms may exist in alum <b>adjuvanticity.</b>|$|E

The {{efficacy of the}} phytol-derived immunostimulants was evaluated {{in terms of their}} ability to activate innate immunity, amplify various antigen-specific immune responses and engender immunological memory with no discernible adverse effects in both competent and immune-deficient mice. The profile that emerges out of these studies reveals that the phytol derivatives are excellent immunostimulants, superior in many respects to a number of commercial adjuvants...|$|E

However, {{little is known}} about the cellular and molecular basis of the immunostimulatory activity of LT at the mucosal level, and even less information is available on the mechanisms underlying its systemic adjuvant activity. In this study, we show that distinct mechanisms are responsible for the parenteral and mucosal <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LT. Indeed, the systemic administration of LT upregulates the expression of glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR), but not other activation markers, in naive T cells. Using WT and GITR-deficient mice and LT and its enzymatically inactive mutant LTK 63 as adjuvants, we show that the induction of GITR expression in T cells accounts for the systemic immunostimulatory capacity of LT, which requires an intact enzymatic activity. In contrast, the mucosal administration of LT does not induce GITR expression on Peyer's patche T cells and accordingly no differences are observed in the mucosal <b>adjuvanticity</b> of LT between WT and GITR-deficient mice. Altogether, our results demonstrate the distinct effect of LT after parenteral administration when compared with the mucosal delivery, and describe a new mechanism of LT <b>adjuvanticity</b> related to its ability to induce the expression of GITR in CD 4 + T cells.
