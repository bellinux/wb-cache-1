5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus {{have a high}} {{capacity}} to <b>accumulate</b> radioactive caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern. In order to <b>accumulate</b> mass, however, {{only a portion of}} the accreted gas can be ejected, so that with each cycle the white dwarf would steadily increase in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B could continue to <b>accumulate</b> a growing envelope.|$|E
5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons <b>accumulate</b> enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that <b>accumulate</b> or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E
