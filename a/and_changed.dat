After an overview of the theories, programs and approaches for improvement <b>and</b> <b>change,</b> the research method andquestions of research are formalized so as to guide the case study.

Results of the study indicate that although several elementsof improvement <b>and</b> <b>change</b> capabilities are present, functionally oriented organizational structure and a lack of formalized cross improvement <b>and</b> <b>change</b> business process undermine the potential for management performance improvements...|$|R

On February13, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and quickly attained peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). Given the name Haja, the storm passed southeast of Rodrigues and Réunion. Haja approached the southeast coast of Madagascar, but turned to the southeast and weakened, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|According to Fred Guweddeko, a {{researcher}} at Makerere University, Amin {{was the son of}} Andreas Nyabire (1889–1976).

Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was Assa Aatte (1904–1970), an ethnic Lugbara and a traditional herbalist who treated members of Buganda royalty, among others.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an exhaustive research about ongoing language variation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> in the Japanese voice system. Through the analysis I identify {{the roles of}} internal and external factors in human linguistic competence that govern the language variation <b>and</b> <b>change,</b> <b>and</b> I construct a model of grammar that inherently includes the language variation <b>and</b> <b>change.</b> This work aims at the formal theoretical analysis primarily built upon the empirical evidence: {{a huge amount of}} spontaneous speech data. Until now, a number of researches on language variation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> have been done from various perspectives: The sociolinguistic research, specifically {{from the perspective of the}} variationist approach (Labov 1963 et seq., Weinreich et al. 1968), has revealed much about language variation <b>and</b> <b>change,</b> particularly with respect to phonological aspects, focusing on various internal and external factors that govern the phenomena by the quantitative method. However, the formalization of the mechanism of language variation <b>and</b> <b>change</b> is insufficient; the generative grammatical approach (Chomsky 1957) can give a formal account of the phenomena based on the grammatica...|$|R
