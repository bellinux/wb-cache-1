60|$|The {{two boys}} walked {{to where the}} biplane had been put together, in a large open wagon shed {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} the big barn. The biplane has a stretch from side to side of over thirty feet, and the shed had been cleaned out from end to end to make room for it. There was a rudder in front and another behind, and in the centre was a broad cane seat, with a steering wheel, and several levers for controlling the craft. Back of the seat was the engine, lightly built but powerful, and above was a good-sized tank of gasoline. The framework of the biplane was of bamboo, held together by stays of piano wire, and the planes themselves were of canvas, especially prepared so as to be almost if not quite <b>air</b> <b>proof.</b> All told, the machine was a fine one, thoroughly up-to-date, and had cost considerable money.|$|E
40|$|Hereafter, a {{modification}} of the traditional Palmes diffusion tube by fitting a membrane at the open end of the tube is presented. The membrane is placed to avoid the effect of turbulence due to wind speed. Further optimisations {{of the volume of}} absorbent and number of meshes retaining the absorbent are also described. Finally, the sampler is placed in an <b>air</b> <b>proof</b> container and is ready to use in order {{to improve the quality of}} measurement. In order to evaluate the performance of the membrane-closed Palmes diffusion tube to monitor nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), experiments were carried out in an exposure chamber. The relative effect of NO 2, temperature, humidity, averaging time and wind speed on the uptake rate of the sampler were then studied. Among the uncontrolled variables, temperature and humidity are found to be the most important ones leading to variability of the uptake rate. Two equations, used to estimate the uptake rate are established. These equations were then applied on some field data and laboratory inter-comparison tests. The agreement between the chemiluminescence method and diffusive samplers changes from 20 % of mean bias with the traditional Palmes diffusion tubes to 5 % of mean bias with the membraneclosed Palmes tube (MCPT) at the same monitoring site. In the laboratory inter-comparison, the MCPT has shown to be able to correctly measure NO 2 under two extreme exposure conditions in contrast with other diffusive samplers. The uncertainty of the sampler is evaluated. It fulfils the European Directive data quality objective of 25 % for accuracy and therefore the sampler qualifies as an indicative method for NO 2 monitoring. JRC.

40|$|Abstract — There are {{different}} types of robots for climbing on smooth or rough walls. One technique is to use driven wheels for the propulsion and a vacuum system for the adhesion. The seals for the vacuum chambers are slipping over the surface {{and it is not}} guarant that the chambers are always close. Especially over concrete walls a special construction must be found to make the adhesion more safe. On the other side the propulsion system must be able to produce enough force for carrying and accelerating the robot. Any slipping of the wheel must be avoided and this can only be realized if the exiting forces are measured and controll structures are implemented. The paper will present a climbing robot with the described technique. The vacuum system consists of controlled seven chambers for safety reasons. The chamber system was presented in earlier papers and will only be summarized concerning the force theory. The propulsion system will be discussed more detailed. It consist of three omni directional driven wheels which were build up. Additionally they are <b>air</b> <b>proofed,</b> the steering can rotate several times around and a load cell is integrated for detecting all forces. Beside the mechanical realization the prediction algorithm based on a force model will be described. This will avoid critical situations before they occur, like slipping of the wheel and tilting of the robot which will be supported by a inertial navigation system...|$|R

The best route is to obtain a student visa which permits the holder to work up to 20 hours per week (live-in or live-out). To obtain a long-stay visa, non-EU au pairs will need to enroll in and pay for an Italian language course at an approved school or college. The school registrar will issue a certificate which must then be stamped by the local police office (Questura). The visa will be valid only for the length of the course.

40|$|Using the Clark type of {{electrode}} it {{was observed}} that the ratio of the current obtained for water equilibrated with air to the zero or background current is a constant. From this it was shown that a series of calibration curves for the same electrode has a common point of intersection on the ordinate which is termed the electrode constant. It is sug-gested that when this value has been determined for a particular electrode, rapid calibra-tion is possible by use of the constant and the current obtained from water equilibrated with <b>air.</b> The experimental <b>proof</b> and possible theoretical background for this procedure are presented.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the compactifications of the {{canonical}} contact systems living on real jet spaces J^ r(1, 1), r > 2, are locally universal Goursat distributions, Δ^r, living on compact manifolds (called Goursat monsters) having open dense jet-like (J^ r(1, 1) -like) parts. By virtue of the results of Jean (1996), one was able, for each r > 2, to recursively compute the small growth vector of Δ^r at any point of the r-th monster. The result was got by performing series of r operations taken, in function of the local geometry of Δ^r in question, from the set of fixed recursive rules { 1, 2, 3 } (called in the present text S, T, G, respectively). By the local universality of Δ^r one was thus able to compute all small growth vectors of all existing Goursat distributions. In the work of Mormul (2004) proposed were explicit solutions to the series of Jean's recurrences. The solutions uncovered a surprisingly involved underlying arithmetics [...] a kind of Gödel-like encoding of words over a three-letter alphabet {G, S, T} by neat sequences of positive integers. Yet, those formulas, though characterizing really existing objects, appeared as if from thin <b>air,</b> and <b>proofs</b> were postponed to another publication. In the present contribution we submit proofs of our formulas from 2004. It is not, however, a plain check that our candidates satisfy Jean's recurrences.

50|$|During the war {{the cathedral}} was damaged and the roof {{collapsed}} however it escaped serious damage. During restoration works the original designs by Scump {{started to take}} shape. A quire and rood screen were built {{on the west side}} of the cathedral. A pulpit was also incorporated with the screen dedicated to Sir Winston Churchill. The new chancery was dedicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher on December 2, 1949 in the presence of Princess Elizabeth. The east side of the cathedral was then transformed into a baptistery. The under-croft, constructed from remains of the basement of the Auberge d'Allemagne was never used. In 1928 the Bishop of Gibraltar Nugent Hicks opened the under-croft as the new parish hall. In 1938 it was transformed as a gas <b>proof</b> <b>air</b> raid shelter and in the early days of the conflict was used by the chaplain, his wife and scores of Maltese citizens.

60|$|Deerslayer lay passive a {{few minutes}} longer, his eye at the bullet hole, however, and much did he rejoice at seeing that he was drifting, gradually, farther and farther from the shore. When he looked upward, the treetops had disappeared, but he soon found that the canoe was slowly turning, so as to prevent his getting a view of {{anything}} at his peephole, but of the two extremities of the lake. He now bethought him of the stick, which was crooked and offered some facilities for rowing without the necessity of rising. The experiment succeeded on trial, better even than he had hoped, though his great embarrassment {{was to keep the}} canoe straight. That his present manoeuvre was seen soon became apparent by the clamor on the shore, and a bullet entering the stern of the canoe traversed its length, whistling between the arms of our hero, and passed out at the head. This satisfied the fugitive that he was getting away with tolerable speed, and induced him to increase his efforts. He was making a stronger push than common, when another messenger from the point broke the stick out-board, and at once deprived him of his oar. As the sound of voices seemed to grow more and more distant, however, Deerslayer determined to leave all to the drift, until he believed himself beyond the reach of bullets. This was nervous work, but it was the wisest of all the expedients that offered, and the young man was encouraged to persevere in it by the circumstance that he felt his face fanned by the <b>air,</b> a <b>proof</b> that there was a little more wind.|$|R
40|$|Horses {{have been}} {{successfully}} imported to Australia from Member States of the European Union (EU) by the west east route for several years. The majority of horses have travelled via Singapore, on scheduled combi-jet services operated by approved carriers, in open stalls (Animal Quarantine Policy Memoranda 1996 / 09, 1996 / 21, 1997 / 04, 1998 / 51). The term "open stall " refers to any transport stall that is not fully insect-proofed to protect against small insects, such as Culicoides species, with an active ventilation system. Some "open stalls " may be enclosed on four sides and have insect (mosquito) netting available to cover ventilation holes as required. Current import policy for horses travelling this route on scheduled freighter services or transiting in other ports such as the United Arab Emirates or Hong Kong require that they be transported in insect <b>proof</b> <b>air</b> stables.

40|$|Exposure to allergens {{is one of}} severa 1 factors {{determining}} sensitization and allergic {{symptoms in}} individuals. Exposure to aeroallergens from pollen is assessed by counting allergenic pollen in ambient <b>air.</b> However, <b>proof</b> is lacking that pollen count is representative for allergen exposure. We therefore monitored simultaneously birch, grass and olive pollen counts and their corresponding major pollen allergens Bet v 1, Phl p 5 and Ole e 1 across Europe. Already at one location in Europe in Munich, Germany, {{it has been found}} that the same amount of pollen from different years, different trees and even different days released up to lO-fold different amounts of Bet v 1. Thus exposure to allergen is poorly monitored by only monitoring pollen countl- 2. Monitoring the allergen itself in ambient air might be an improvement in allergen exposure assessment. The objective of the HIALINE-project is to evaluate if these effects found in Munich, Germany are also measurable over a bigger geographic area like Europe, {{and at the same time}} implement an outdoor allergen early warning network, in addition to the pollen forecasts. Climatic factors that influence allergen exposure will be extracted and will be used to calculate the effect of climate change on local airborne allergen exposure. The major allergens from the top 3 airborne allergens in Europe (grasses, birch and olive) are sampled with a cascade impactor, extracted and analyzed by allergen specific ELISA 's. Pollen counts are measured by standard pollen traps and correlated with the weather data. Allergen forecast will be calculated by incorporating the SILAM chemical transport model and compared with the observations of HIALINE aiming at a comprehensive parameterization of the allergen release and transport. Expected outcomes are the implementation of a network of European outdoor allergen measurements to better predict allergic symptoms. Also the climatic factors that govern allergen exposure in outdoor air will be established. These can be used to calculate the effect of climate change on the health effects of airborne allergens The research leading to these results has received funding from the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers under grant agreement No 2008 11 07...|$|R
60|$|The mules {{were again}} urged to {{increase}} their pace, and images of the refreshment and repose that were expected from the convent's hospitality, became general and grateful among the travellers. The day was fast disappearing from the glens and ravines through which they rode, and all discourse ceased in the desire to get on. The exceeding purity of the atmosphere, which, at that great elevation, resembled a medium of thought rather than of matter, rendered objects defined, just, and near; and none but the mountaineers and Sigismund, who were used to the deception, (for in effect truth obtains this character {{with those who have}} been accustomed to the false) and who understood the grandeur of the scale on which nature has displayed her power among the Alps, knew how to calculate the distance which still separated them from their goal. More than a league of painful and stony ascent was to be surmounted, and yet Adelheid and Christine had both permitted slight exclamations of pleasure to escape them, when Pierre pointed to the speck of blue sky between the hoary pinnacles above, and first gave them to understand that it denoted the position of the convent. Here and there, too, small patches of the last year's snow were discovered, lying under the shadows of overhanging rocks, and which were likely to resist the powers of the sun till winter came again; another certain sign that they had reached a height greatly exceeding that of the usual habitations of men. The keenness of the <b>air</b> was another <b>proof</b> of their situation, for all the travellers had heard that the Augustines dwelt among eternal frosts, a report which is nearly literally true.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of household adaptation, different classifications of adaptation measures have been constructed, but classifications of adaptive households are rare. Harvatt et al. (2011) categorized households into active and non-active types; non-active households respond with a do-nothing strategy {{as a result of}} denying the risk or living with it, whereas active households take reducing or changing measures. By classifying the measures undertaken by households, Thurston et al. (2008) categorize flood resistance and resilience measures into categories of temporary resistance (e.g. installing door guards), of permanent resistance (e.g. permanent flood proof external doors), of resilience without resilient flooring (e.g. raising electrics) and of resilience with resilient flooring (e.g. sealed floors). Linnekamp et al. (2011) categorize flood protection into individual actions, such as raising the level of own yards, and collective actions, such as assisting neighbours in undertaking protective measures. Classifications of adaptation measures and of households with regard to their adaptation behaviour also exist in studies on river flooding. Precautionary river flooding measures can be categorized according to their costs and efforts: low-cost measures (e.g. relocation of water-sensitive objects), medium-cost measures (e.g. flood-adopted interior fitting) and high-cost measures (e.g. flood <b>proof</b> <b>air</b> conditioning) are mentioned as household and household business measures by Kreibich et al. (2011). Adaptive behaviour can also be classified into protection against financial risks (by purchasing insurances), acquisition of information about precaution and precaution itself, by flood-proofing and retrofitting property (e.g. adapting use of building) (Thieken et al. 2007). An example of a classification of specifically structural protection measures is the one study carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA London (2008)), which distinguishes between measures at property-level (e.g. against the entry of water into the house) and resilience (reduction of damaging by entered water). The classification methods applied in these studies differ; ad-hoc classifications are frequently used, whereas systematic approaches, such as statistical ones, have not been used extensively in the literature on household-level adaptation to coastal and river flooding.|$|R
