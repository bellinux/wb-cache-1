5|$|Field marshal is the five-star {{rank and}} highest {{attainable}} {{rank in the}} Indian Army. Though the rank is placed above general, it is not observed in the regular structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. A field marshal receives the full pay of a four–star general, and is considered a serving officer until their death. They wear a full uniform on all ceremonial occasions. In addition to this, they also run {{an office in the}} Army Headquarters with <b>a</b> <b>secretariat.</b>|$|E
5|$|The LSA aims {{to advance}} the {{scientific}} study of language and accomplishes this goal through advocacy efforts. The Society, recognizing its growing role in advocacy, established <b>a</b> <b>Secretariat</b> in Washington, DC in 1969 to better liaise between its membership and the government. Around that same time, the LSA began working with other professional organizations to meet and exchange research as part of the Consortium of Social Science Associations (COSSA). During the Reagan administration after cuts to social science funding in 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded COSSA as an advocacy effort for the funding of social science research.|$|E
5|$|The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee was {{established}} on 5 August 1897, after the Parliament of Norway accepted {{the duty to}} award the Nobel Peace Prize {{as stated in the}} will of Alfred Nobel. The first prize was awarded in 1901. The Committee is assisted by <b>a</b> <b>secretariat</b> {{that is part of the}} Norwegian Nobel Institute. In 1901, the committee was renamed the Nobel Committee of the Parliament of Norway, but this was reverted in 1977. In 1948, the election system was changed to make the committee more proportional to the representation in parliament. From then until 1967, the Labour Party, who held a majority in parliament, had three representatives in the committee.|$|E

5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} larger role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established <b>a</b> <b>Secretariat</b> in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium of Social Science Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support of social science research.|$|E
5|$|Malawi’s first {{science and}} {{technology}} policy dates from 1991 and was revised in 2002. The National Science and Technology Policy of 2002 envisaged {{the establishment of a}} National Commission for Science and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on {{science and technology}}-led development. Although the Science and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with <b>a</b> <b>secretariat</b> resulting from the merger of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Council. The Science and Technology Act of 2003 also established a Science and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, as of 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science and Technology has reviewed the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Wessex, which {{eventually}} laid claim to England as a whole, evolved a centralised royal administration. One {{part of this}} was the king's council, the witenagemot, comprising the senior clergy, ealdormen, {{and some of the}} more important thegns; the council met to advise the king on policy and legal issues. The royal household included officials, thegns and <b>a</b> <b>secretariat</b> of clergy which travelled with the king, conducting the affairs of government as it went. Under the Danish kings, a bodyguard of housecarls also accompanied the court. At a regional level, ealdormen played an important part in government, defence and taxation, and the post of sheriff emerged in the 10th century, administering local shires on behalf of an ealdorman. Anglo-Saxon mints were tightly controlled by the kings, providing a high quality currency, and the whole country was taxed using a system called hidage.|$|E

5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Vijayanagara empire {{maintained}} the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary. The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers (Pradhana) headed by the prime minister (Mahapradhana). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary (Karyakartha or Rayaswami) and the imperial officers (Adhikari). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training. <b>A</b> <b>secretariat</b> near the king's palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a wax seal imprinted with the ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords (Goudas) supervised accountants (Karanikas or Karnam) and guards (Kavalu). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (Niyogas), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.|$|E

25|$|The Commissioner {{is said to}} have {{deposited}} his extortion {{funds in}} neutral Switzerland, with Schweizerische Volksbank (later incorporated into Credit Suisse). According to other accounts, he made efforts to embezzle the money he had extorted from would-be emigrants to Palestine, and received 20 million lei from the Iași survivors, pledging them his leniency. In July 1943, Lecca suggested to postpone the planned confiscation of Iași's Jewish Cemetery. His comments were ignored by the city's antisemitic mayor, Constantin Ifrim, whose only concession on this issue was to leave exhumations in the care of a Judaic congregation. In September of the same year, Lecca was promoted Commissioner General by the Antonescus, his department reintegrated within <b>a</b> <b>Secretariat</b> for Labor. The same month, Ifrim sent Lecca a memorandum, demanding the deportation of Iași Jews to Transnistria or to the German Reichskommissariat Ukraine.|$|E

The structure could be expanded depending on the needs and availability of resources. <b>A</b> permanent <b>secretariat</b> would immensely enhance the image and capabilities of the organization.
