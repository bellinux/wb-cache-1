5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus of Panama first began to form. The <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> found that Pacific angelsharks from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of the}} other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E

5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire has any place in dictating the terms of peace. The <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> insist that the German populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E

5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous {{ideas about the}} exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E

5|$|Several Psilocybe {{species have}} an {{appearance}} roughly similar to P.allenii, but these {{can usually be}} distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P.serbica var. moravica has a similar cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P.allenii. The closely related P.cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P.allenii. P.azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season {{similar to that of}} P.cyanescens. The <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> note that the Australian P.subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P.australiana, P.eucalypta, and P.tasmaniana) but suggest that further research is required to better understand the delimitation of this species complex.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch officers' {{report was}} not mistaken: {{early in the}} morning, two Spanish scouts had found the track of the Dutch force {{crossing}} the river, and Mondragón, anticipating them, had deployed his cavalry beyond a beechwood, the countryside southwards the Lippe being covered by small woods alternating with moorlands. Besides the troops guarding the convoy, Juan de Córdoba had the command of at least seven cavalry companies: those of Hendrik van den Bergh, Girolamo Caraffa, Carlo Maria Caracciolo, Paulo Emilio Martinengo, his own company, 's-Hertogenbosch lances under Adolf van den Bergh and Sancho de Leyva's company. Other <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> list Alonso Mendo's company. Mondragón had informed the guard of the convoy of the Dutch intentions and encouraged the soldiers to hold their ground, promising them that he was behind them with the whole Spanish army to come in relief.|$|E
5|$|The first {{species of}} giant mouse lemur was {{described}} by the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near Morondava in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the lectotype was selected in 1939 as MNHN1867–603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist Charles Coquerel, Grandidier placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (M.coquereli) with the dwarf lemurs in the genus Cheirogaleus (which he spelled Cheirogalus) as C.coquereli. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), which he considered to also be members of Cheirogaleus. The following year, the German naturalist Hermann Schlegel and Dutch naturalist François Pollen independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, coquereli, basing theirs on an individual from around the Bay of Ampasindava in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs); however, these <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> listed all Cheirogaleus under Microcebus and based the classification of their species on similarities with the greater dwarf lemur (M.typicus, now C.major).|$|E

5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The <b>authors</b> <b>also</b> reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E
