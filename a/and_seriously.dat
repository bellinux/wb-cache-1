5|$|On 29 August 1984, B-1A (AF Ser. No. 74-0159) stalled {{and crashed}} while {{performing}} minimum control speed tests at low altitude. The crew used the escape capsule {{to leave the}} bomber, but the parachutes deployed improperly, causing the capsule to hit nose down. The impact killed the B-1's pilot, Rockwell test pilot Doug Benefield, <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> injured two other crew members.|$|E
5|$|Voss was bequeathed an Albatros D.III in the squadron's insignia. During {{his brief}} spell with Jasta 5, Voss scored a further half dozen victories. However, {{he was not}} always successful; {{he was one of}} the three German fighters who {{attacked}} <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged Captain Keith Caldwell of 60 Squadron on 28 May 1917, just after Voss's 31st victory, but the wily New Zealander escaped.|$|E

5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|Along with Chidananda Dasgupta and others, Ray {{founded the}} Calcutta Film Society in 1947. They {{screened}} many foreign films, {{many of which}} Ray watched <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> studied. He befriended the American GIs stationed in Calcutta during World War II, who kept him informed about the latest American films showing in the city. He came to know a RAF employee, Norman Clare, who shared Ray's passion for films, chess and western classical music.|$|E

5|$|Deutschland saw {{significant}} {{action with}} the Kriegsmarine, including several non-intervention patrols, {{during which she}} was attacked by Republican bombers. At the outbreak of World War II, she was cruising the North Atlantic, prepared to attack Allied merchant traffic. Bad weather hampered her efforts, and she only sank or captured three vessels before returning to Germany, after which she was renamed Lützow. She then participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway. Damaged at the Battle of Drøbak Sound, she was recalled to Germany for repairs. While en route, she was torpedoed by a British submarine <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged.|$|E
5|$|Five people {{perished in}} the country. Three men were killed in Taipei, two when they were struck by wind-blown objects and one when a house collapsed. Elsewhere, a {{fatality}} was reported because of a landslide in Taichung. Moreover, at least 15 other people were reportedly injured throughout Taiwan. A woman in the harbor city of Keelung was struck in the head <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> injured by a broken window.|$|E
5|$|In South Carolina, minor beach erosion was {{reported}} in Charleston and Colleton Counties. Swells of up to 15ft (4.5m), in combination with strong waves, caused overwash on Route 12 on Hatteras Island. Minor beach erosion occurred. Moderate winds of up to 50mph (80km/h) blew down a few trees and caused shingle damage to buildings. In Delaware, rough surf closed numerous coastal beaches, while storm tides and waves flooded a campground near the Indian River in Sussex County. Strong waves in New Jersey killed two people <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> injured another. Lifeguards made numerous rescues along the coast, while other beaches were closed or had restrictions on bathing. Winds were minor along the Jersey coastline, peaking at less than 30mph (48km/h).|$|E

During his {{struggle with the}} Mangalores he kills their leader. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> wounding Leeloo before taking a carrying case that he presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The Engineers try to flee Site F, using Briggs and {{the hostages}} as human shields. Fisher, {{disguised}} as an Air Force hostage, helps Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men. Sadiq escapes on foot, and Fisher disarms <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> wounds him. Sadiq boasts {{that he has}} already won; if he dies twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S. {{and if he is}} tried, he will leak U.S. information. Although Fisher spares Sadiq, he detains him. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations; in a post-credits scene, a recovered Coste and Fisher prepare to interrogate Sadiq.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise.

5|$|When Said bin Taimur of Oman {{was ousted}} in a coup in July 1970 and {{replaced}} with his son Qaboos bin Said, he was sent in exile and lived at the Dorchester {{until his death in}} 1972. The McAlpine family owned the hotel until 1977 when they sold it to a consortium of businessmen from the Middle East headed by the Sultan of Brunei. On 3 June 1982, Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom was shot <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> injured in an assassination attempt as he left the Dorchester. The attack was the immediate cause for the 1982 Lebanon War.|$|E

5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians {{and asked them}} to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage.|$|E
5|$|Bringing dead <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded {{down from}} the top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|Olid treated González and Las Casas more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} of Honduras {{resulted in a}} significant weakening of Olid's forces. Las Casas and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González and Las Casas set upon Olid one evening <b>and</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to Mexico or resettled in other parts of Honduras. A court in Mexico subsequently condemned Las Casas and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, but neither was ever punished.|$|E
