5|$|Nearly all artillery, {{including}} howitzers, guns, anti-aircraft and rockets, were {{tasked with}} <b>anti-tank</b> defence. Dug-in tanks and self-propelled guns further strengthened the <b>anti-tank</b> defences. <b>Anti-tank</b> forces {{were incorporated into}} every level of command, mostly as <b>anti-tank</b> strong points with the majority concentrated on likely attack routes and the remainder amply spread out elsewhere. Each <b>anti-tank</b> strong-point typically consisted of four to six <b>anti-tank</b> guns, six to nine <b>anti-tank</b> rifles, and five to seven heavy and light machine guns. They were supported by mobile obstacle detachments {{as well as by}} infantry with automatic firearms. Independent tank and self-propelled gun brigades and regiments were tasked with cooperating with the infantry during counterattacks.|$|E
5|$|At 19:30 on 12July 1943 {{the brigade}} {{took off from}} North Africa Consisting of 105 Dakotas, eight of them towing Waco gliders and 11 Albemarles towing Horsa gliders, the gliders amongst other things transported the twelve <b>anti-tank</b> guns of the 1st (Airlanding) <b>Anti-Tank</b> Battery.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, {{comprised}} the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, the 1st(Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers and the 1st(Airlanding) <b>Anti-Tank</b> Battery, Royal Artillery. The airlanding <b>anti-tank</b> battery were {{equipped with the}} 1st Para Brigade's only <b>anti-tank</b> guns, the British 6pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, {{the only way to}} transport the <b>anti-tank</b> guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{had more}} serious grounds for {{complaint}} about the Belgian <b>anti-tank</b> defences along the Dyle line, {{that covered the}} Namur–Perwez gap which was not protected by any natural obstacles. Only {{a few days before}} the attack, General Headquarters had discovered the Belgians had sited their <b>anti-tank</b> defences (de Cointet defences) several miles east of the Dyle between Namur–Perwez.|$|E
5|$|The Projector, 2.5inchmore {{commonly}} known as the Northover Projectorwas an ad hoc <b>anti-tank</b> weapon used by the British Army and Home Guard during the Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly <b>anti-tank</b> weaponry. The Northover Projector was designed by a Home Guard officer named Robert Harry Northover to act as a makeshift <b>anti-tank</b> weapon, and was put into production in 1940 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) Mk I was a British man-portable <b>anti-tank</b> weapon {{developed}} during the Second World War. The PIAT was designed in 1942 {{in response to the}} British Army's need for a more effective infantry <b>anti-tank</b> weapon, and entered service in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun was {{an ad hoc}} <b>anti-tank</b> {{artillery}} piece used by the British Army and Home Guard {{during the}} Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly <b>anti-tank</b> weaponry. The Smith Gun was designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift <b>anti-tank</b> weapon, and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Under the April 1942 organization, each {{infantry}} battalion had an <b>anti-tank</b> platoon {{with four}} 37mm guns (1/4 ton trucks, {{better known as}} jeeps, were authorized as prime movers) and each regiment an <b>anti-tank</b> company with twelve (towed by 3/4 ton trucks). Each of the four divisional artillery battalions possessed six <b>anti-tank</b> guns, the combat engineering battalion had nine pieces (towed by M2 halftracks); in addition, the division's headquarters company had four (towed by 3/4ton trucks) and the divisional maintenance company two.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by <b>anti-tank</b> fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the <b>anti-tank</b> position. Möbius divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing {{and ran into the}} British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the <b>anti-tank</b> gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an <b>anti-tank</b> gun and destroyed, the other two were engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{appointment}} {{coincided with}} more trained men and better equipment becoming available. Under Brooke, new strategies and tactics were devised. More concentration {{was placed on}} defending the coastal crust, while inland a hedgehog defence strategy of defended localities and <b>anti-tank</b> islands was established, each having all-round defence. Many of these <b>anti-tank</b> islands were established along the already constructed stop lines, where existing defences could {{be integrated into the}} new strategy and, especially, at towns and villages where there was a Home Guard to provide personnel.|$|E
5|$|Defences were {{in place}} at both bridges. On {{the west bank of}} the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an <b>anti-tank</b> gun. To their north were another three machine-guns and a {{concrete}} pillbox. An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with <b>anti-tank</b> and anti-aircraft guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Soviets {{unveiled}} the T-26 mod. 1933. The Model 1933, {{with a new}} single cylindrical turret carrying one 45mm cannon L46 (length in calibers, which meant quite high initial velocity, over 700–800m/s depending on ammunition) and one 7.62 mm machine gun, became the most common T-26 variant. The 45mm 20K tank gun {{was based on the}} Soviet 45 mm <b>anti-tank</b> gun M1932 (19-K) {{and it was one of}} the most powerful <b>anti-tank</b> guns of its time. Actually, few, if any, western tanks existed with similar guns. The T-26 could carry up to three secondary DT 7.62mm machine guns in coaxial, rear, and anti-aircraft mounts. This increased firepower was intended to aid crews in defeating dedicated <b>anti-tank</b> teams, as the original machine gun armament had been found insufficient. The turret rear ball mounting for the additional DT tank machine gun was installed on the T-26 tanks from the end of 1935 until 1939.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the first}} {{airborne}} divisions were formed. According to their October 1942 organizational structure, an airborne division had 44 37mm <b>anti-tank</b> guns: four in divisional artillery (AA/AT battery of parachute field artillery battalion), 24 in the AA/AT battalion, and eight {{in each of}} two glider infantry regiments; parachute infantry regiments did not have <b>anti-tank</b> guns. In practice, airborne divisions often had only one glider infantry regiment and therefore 36 guns.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} light <b>anti-tank</b> guns, the M3 was {{widely used in}} the {{infantry}} support role and as an anti-personnel weapon, firing high-explosive and canister rounds.|$|E
5|$|On 8 and 9 January 1943, Div Cav {{advanced}} again. The A Squadron vehicles at Nofilia {{were loaded}} on transporters, which {{drove down the}} main road {{while the rest of}} the regiment screened the New Zealand Division advance. The A Squadron vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el Chebir, east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi Temet, and the regiment caught up on 14 January. The following day, A Squadron crossed the road and withstood shelling by <b>anti-tank</b> guns and artillery until the afternoon. B Squadron probed south, also encountering German <b>anti-tank</b> guns. After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an <b>anti-tank</b> gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging <b>anti-tank</b> guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a mine on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, bivouacking halfway there, before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.|$|E
5|$|T-26V V=Vetäjä (Towing): Finnish variant {{proposed}} for towing <b>anti-tank</b> guns. Similar to the T-26T artillery tractor. 3 prototypes converted from captured T-26s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|TACAM R-2: (Tun Anticar pe Afet Mobil - Self-Propelled <b>Anti-Tank</b> Gun) Romanian tank {{destroyer}} conversions of R-2 tanks, mounting captured Soviet weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian 7th Infantry Division was {{assigned}} to guard the three bridges over the canal, supplementing the troops who garrisoned Fort Eben-Emael {{at the time of}} the battle. The defences for each bridge consisted of four large concrete pillboxes on the western side of the canal, three equipped with machine-guns and a fourth with an <b>anti-tank</b> gun; the bunker containing the <b>anti-tank</b> gun was positioned close to the road leading from the bridge, with one machinegun-equipped bunker immediately behind the bridge and two others flanking the bridge a short distance either side. A company position existed on the western bank of the canal by each of the bridges, with a small observation post on the eastern side, which could be quickly recalled, and all three bridges could be destroyed with demolition charges set into their structures, triggered by a firing mechanism situated in the <b>anti-tank</b> bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army under Montgomery spent February at Medinine in {{south-eastern}} Tunisia. Expecting {{an imminent}} {{attack by the}} Axis, the Eighth Army mustered every <b>anti-tank</b> gun it could from Egypt and Libya. The 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) <b>Anti-Tank</b> Regiment, including the Rhodesian <b>Anti-Tank</b> Battery under Major Savory, duly advanced west from Benghazi and reached the front on 5 March 1943. The Germans and Italians assaulted Medinine the next day, but failed to make much progress and abandoned their attack by the evening. The Rhodesian gunners, held in reserve, did not {{take part in the}} engagement but were attacked from the air. The Rhodesians of the KRRC, now under the 7th Motor Brigade, moved up from Libya during early March. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, which had spent 1942 and the first months of 1943 in Iran and Iraq, returned to North Africa the same month, with the future Prime Minister Ian Smith in its ranks as a Hurricane pilot.|$|E
5|$|The Marines {{captured}} 12 37mm <b>anti-tank</b> guns, one 70mm {{field artillery}} piece, and 34 machineguns and counted the dead bodies of 239 Japanese soldiers, including 28 officers.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the {{regiment}} was withdrawn and {{became part of}} the divisional reserve at Alam el Onsol. Orders arrived for an advance on 30 October for Operation Supercharge, planned as the final attack of the battle. The regiment was placed under the command of the 9th Armoured Brigade on 1 November, with each squadron attached to an armoured unit. A Squadron was attached to the 3rd Hussars, C Squadron to the Warwickshire Yeomanry and B Squadron to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry. The assault began the following day, with the squadrons ordered to screen the minefields for the armoured brigade. The 3rd Hussars reached the Rahman track, losing their <b>anti-tank</b> guns. The Wiltshire Yeomanry lost a Crusader squadron to <b>anti-tank</b> fire and was nearly destroyed {{by the end of the}} day. Four B Squadron men were killed by <b>anti-tank</b> fire as the squadron advanced behind the Wiltshires. The Warwickshires, mistaking high ground for their objective, destroyed several <b>anti-tank</b> guns there. At the end of the day {{the regiment}}, except for C Squadron, returned to Alam el Onsol.|$|E
5|$|To {{cover the}} withdrawal, the company's platoon of LAV-25s and LAV-ATs (<b>anti-tank</b> variants) moved {{to engage the}} Iraqi force. One of the <b>anti-tank</b> {{vehicles}} opened fire, after receiving permission, at what it believed was an Iraqi tank. Instead, the missile destroyed a friendly LAV-AT a few hundred meters in front of it. Despite this loss, the platoon continued forward and soon opened fire on the Iraqi tanks with the LAV-25s' autocannons. The fire could not penetrate the tanks' armor, but did damage their optics and prevented the tanks from fighting back effectively.|$|E
5|$|Where natural <b>anti-tank</b> {{barriers}} {{needed only}} to be augmented, concrete or wooden posts sufficed.|$|E
5|$|While the M60s were {{replaced}} by the Leopard 2s, the AMX-30EM2s {{were replaced}} by the Italian B1 Centauro <b>anti-tank</b> vehicle {{in the early years}} of the 2000s (decade).|$|E
5|$|Wittmann drove towards Villers-Bocage {{and along}} the road, the Rifle Brigade troops {{attempted}} to reply with PIAT <b>anti-tank</b> weapons and a 6-pounder <b>anti-tank</b> gun but, as the Tiger drew closer, panic set in and the riflemen looked for cover. The brigade vehicles were set on fire by machine guns and high-explosive shells, but few casualties were inflicted. At {{the east end of}} Villers-Bocage, Wittmann engaged and knocked out three M5 Stuart light tanks of the 4th CLY Reconnaissance Troop.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called {{for the majority of the}} 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on day one. The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one <b>anti-tank</b> platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine gun and <b>anti-tank</b> platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
5|$|After safely landing {{the first}} half of the division, the 12th Cruiser Squadron {{returned}} to Bizerta to collect the remaining troops, consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade, the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the Glider Pilot Regiment. The only casualties in the landing occurred on 10September when HMS Abdiel, while manoeuvring alongside the dock, struck a mine and sank. Casualties totaled 58 killed and 154 wounded from the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, and 48 dead among Abdiel's crew. Abdiel was also carrying twelve 6pounder <b>anti-tank</b> guns of the 2nd <b>Anti-tank</b> Battery, and the division's reserve ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|Although {{an earlier}} {{organization}} included a divisional <b>anti-tank</b> battalion (two companies of 37mm guns and one company of 75 mm guns), in December 1941 these AT battalions {{were removed from}} the divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with self-propelled ones as soon as the latter became available.|$|E
5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble those of}} hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough to take an <b>anti-tank</b> mine. When not in use, the sockets were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E
5|$|At 19:30 on 12July1943, {{the first}} {{aircraft}} carrying the 1,856 {{men of the}} 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa. The aircraft used consisted of 105Douglas C-47 Skytrains belonging to the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 51 each from the 60th and the 62d Troop Carrier Groups, while the 64th Troop Carrier Group supplied the other three. No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force supplied eleven Armstrong Whitworth Albemarles. Following behind the parachute force were the glider towing aircraft. These aircraft, again supplied by No. 38 Wing, comprised 12 Albemarles and seven Handley Page Halifaxes, towing 11 Horsa gliders and eight Waco gliders. The gliders were used to carry 77 men, mostly from the <b>anti-tank</b> battery, ten 6pounder <b>anti-tank</b> guns and 18 jeeps.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 12 June {{the entire}} 3rd Parachute Brigade {{position}} came under artillery and mortar fire {{prior to a}} major attack scheduled to start at 15:00. A German battalion attacked the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, another supported by six tanks and self-propelled guns attacked the 9th Parachute Battalion and the 5th Black Watch. The battle for the Château cost the Black Watch nine Bren Gun Carriers and destroyed all of their <b>anti-tank</b> guns. Unable to resist {{they were forced to}} pull back to the Bois de Mont, joining the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was being attacked by the German armoured vehicles. One tank in front of 'B' Company was hit by two PIAT rounds, but remained in action. The tank destroyed two of 'B' company's machine-gun posts, when it was hit by a third <b>anti-tank</b> projectile and withdrew. The attack killed or wounded the last men in the Machine-Gun Platoon and the <b>Anti-Tank</b> Platoon was reduced to one PIAT detachment. The German infantry were in danger of over-running the battalion, when Otway contacted brigade headquarters, informing them they were not able to hold out much longer. Brigadier James Hill personally led a counter-attack of forty men from the Canadian battalion which drove off the Germans. By 20:00 the area defended by the two battalions had been cleared of all opposition and the front line restored.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex {{features}} twenty-four weapons, {{ranging from}} crowbars, electroshock weapons, and riot baton, to laser guided <b>anti-tank</b> rockets and assault rifles; both lethal and non-lethal weapons are available. The player {{can also make}} use of several weapons of opportunity, such as fire extinguishers.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} that day, Egyptian Chief-of-Staff Saad el-Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia, at President Sadat's request. Shazly sought {{to assess the}} situation {{and to work with}} Khalil on a plan to counter the Israeli advance. They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the east bank and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force, and to have Egyptian forces on the east bank attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli corridor to the canal. Azmy's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal, and additional Sa'iqa units would be committed. Shazly also solved a major problem concerning <b>anti-tank</b> weaponry. Azmy's brigade was almost completely lacking <b>anti-tank</b> weapons; it had been stripped of its <b>anti-tank</b> guided missile (ATGM) battalion, equipped with AT-3 Saggers and RPG-7s, which was sent to the east bank to support the initial offensive. This battalion, and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade, were now withdrawn from the east bank throughout October 18 and brought back to their units. Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy, as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail, not to withdraw any units from the east bank. Several measures decided upon were not implemented however.|$|E
5|$|Finally, U.S. armored {{divisions}} {{under the}} March 1942 organization possessed 68 37mm <b>anti-tank</b> guns. Of these, 37 {{belonged to the}} armored infantry regiment (four in each company and one in regiment HQ); 27 to the armored engineer battalion; three to the divisional train and one to division HQ.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of <b>anti-tank</b> weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France. One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm <b>anti-tank</b> gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm <b>anti-tank</b> gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
