Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described the song as [...] "a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong." [...] Author David Kootnikoff described it as a [...] " [...] of the American Dream gone rancid".|$|E

2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states to take <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E
