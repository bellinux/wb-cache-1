5|$|<b>Always</b> <b>one</b> of the {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later {{described himself as a}} bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E

5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is <b>always</b> <b>one</b> or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is <b>always</b> <b>one</b> less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara. During the campaign there was <b>always</b> <b>one</b> British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease {{operations in the}} area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E

Since there is <b>always</b> <b>one</b> founding queen in a P. snelleni nest, the denominator of colony productivity is <b>always</b> <b>one.</b> Productivity was found to vary drastically {{with a couple of}} very large nests that were found in Kanto, Japan. These nests had hundreds of cells in comparison to the usually 100 cells. In these nests, there was a female-biased sex ratio, which lines up with the resource availability hypothesis. This hypothesis states that colonies with better resources should be more heavily female based. The numbers of first brood workers in these nests were not greater than other nests, but there were a lot more females, so the sex ratio was heavily female.|$|E

25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{predicts that}} if certain properties {{of a system}} are measured, the result may be quantized, meaning that only specific discrete values can occur.

(Energy quantization is discussed below.) Another example is quantization of angular momentum.
