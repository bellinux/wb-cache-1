5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> negotiations, {{that of the}} {{surrender}} of German armed forces, were conducted in May 1945. Smith and Strong met with {{the representatives of the}} Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Generaladmiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as translator.

5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> inputs becomes available to it.|$|E

5|$|Formerly, only {{sections}} of the Liber had appeared in print, without translations. Parts of the Liber were edited by D. J. Stewart and published by the Anglia Christiana Society in 1848. Other extracts were published in various works, including parts of Book I that were included in Volume 2 of Jean Mabillon's nine-volume Acta Sanctorum, printed between 1688 and 1701. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> extracts, mainly consisting of parts of Book II, was compiled by Roger Gale's father Thomas Gale, {{as part of his}} Historicae Britannicae Scriptores XV, published at Oxford in 1691.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As {{a part of the}} Concordat, he presented <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E
5|$|Smith had {{to conduct}} <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{surrender}} negotiations, {{that of the}} German armed forces, in May 1945. Smith met with {{the representatives of the}} German High Command (the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), Colonel General Alfred Jodl and General-Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as an interpreter. Smith took a hard line, threatening that unless terms were accepted, the Allies would seal the front, thus forcing the remaining Germans {{into the hands of the}} Red Army, but he made some concessions regarding a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect. On May 7, Smith signed the surrender document, along with the French representative, Major General François Sevez, and the Soviet Susloparov.|$|E
5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E

The eldest, Alvin (born in 1828), died within hours of birth, as did twins Thaddeus and Louisa (born in 1831). When the twins died, the Smiths adopted <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> twins, Julia and Joseph, whose mother had recently died in childbirth; Joseph died of measles in 1832. In 1841, Don Carlos, who had been born a year earlier, died of malaria. In 1842, Emma gave birth to a stillborn son. Joseph and Emma had four sons who lived to maturity: Joseph Smith III, Frederick Granger Williams Smith, Alexander Hale Smith, and David Hyrum Smith.|$|E
5|$|The main {{influence}} in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, {{and together they}} share an interest in archaeology and a fascination for the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves in the cellar of the Burrows home and re-excavate it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond the door is an old lift that takes them down to <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses {{that appear to be}} carved out of the walls themselves flank the street.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1919 {{version of}} M-13 {{ran along the}} west side of the state, roughly replaced by what is now US131 in 1926. The current highway was first designated by 1932 with the M-13 moniker. After a series of extensions in the 1930s, the highway ran from Lennon to Saginaw. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> expansions in the 1960s added roadways that previously carried US23 all the way north to the Standish area.

5|$|WASP-44 was {{observed}} between July and November 2009 by the WASP-South, a station of the SuperWASP planet-searching program {{based at the}} South African Astronomical Observatory. Observations of the star revealed a periodic decrease in its brightness. WASP-South, along with the SuperWASP-North station at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary Islands, collected 15,755 photometric observations, allowing scientists to produce a more accurate light curve. <b>Another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> observations yielded a 6,000 point photometric data set, but the light curve was prepared late and was not considered in the discovery paper.|$|E
5|$|Alien {{has been}} {{released}} in many home video formats and packages over the years. The first of these was a seventeen-minute Super-8 version for home projectionists. It was also released on both VHS and Betamax for rental, which grossed it an additional $40,300,000 in the United States alone. Several VHS releases were subsequently issued both separately and as boxed sets. LaserDisc and Videodisc versions followed, including deleted scenes and director commentary as bonus features. A VHS box set containing Alien and its sequels Aliens and Alien 3 was released in facehugger-shaped boxes, and included some of the deleted scenes from the Laserdisc editions. When Alien Resurrection premiered in theaters, <b>another</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> the first three films was released including a Making of Alien Resurrection tape. A few months later the set was re-released with the full version of Alien Resurrection taking {{the place of the}} making-of video. Alien was released on DVD in 1999, both separately and, as The Alien Legacy, packaged with Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. This set, which was also released in a VHS version, included a commentary track by Ridley Scott. The first three films of the series have also been packaged as the Alien Triple Pack.|$|E
