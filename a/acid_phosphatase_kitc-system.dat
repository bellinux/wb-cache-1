40|$|The <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> of rat liver mitochondrial-lysosomal {{fractions}} {{have been}} examined by quantitative and electrophoretic means. Disruption of mitochondrial-lysosomal material by freeze-thawing, sonication, or by blendor treatment released approximately 55. 0 to 65. 0 per cent of the total <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity of the fraction into the unsedimentable phase. Electrophoretic preparations of this material showed a single acid phosphatase-active site. Treatment of mitochondrial-lysosomal fractions with 5. 0 per cent Triton X- 100 released 98. 0 per cent of the total <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity of the fraction into the unsedimentable phase. Electrophoretic preparations of this material showed two major sites of <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity. One of these was identical to that resolved following physical disruption. The other site was characteristically seen only after treatment with Triton X- 100. This <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> was also released by treatment with digitonin but to a lesser extent. Quantitative and electrophoretic examination indicated that both components of <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> were concentrated in the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction. Physical separation of the <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> released by detergent treatment from the <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> released by physical disruption was achieved. It was concluded that two categories of <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> may reside in lysosomal particles.

40|$|The <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{activity}} of normal alveolar and BCG-induced alveolar macrophages has been examined. Five electrophoretically distinct forms of <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{have been identified}} in both normal and BCG-induced macrophages. The <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> can be divided into two major categories. One category, containing four distinct forms, is readily solubilized after repeated freezing and thawing or mechanical disruption The second category, containing one form, is firmly bound to the lysosomal membrane and can be solubilized by treatment of the lysosomal fraction with Triton X- 100. The Triton-extractable <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> and the predominant aqueous soluble <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> have been shown to differ in the degree of membrane binding, in solubility, in net charge, and in molecular weight. The two pre-dominant phosphatases possess identical pH optimum and do not differ in response to enzyme inhibitors.

The prostatic <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> was excreted into the urine no only during micturiation, but also {{a portion of the}} prostatic secretion became mixed with urine in the bladder even without micturiation. Therefore, it is assumed that there exists some transmission between the contents of the bladder and of the posterior urethra. 3. It seems that urinary <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> in the bladder becomes concentni. ted with presence of residual urine. 4. The amount of urinary <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> of the adult human male shows a great variation among individuals and daily even in the same individual. 5. It was considered that there was no definite correlation between the urinary <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> and the specific gravity of urine when the gravity ranged within 1012 - 1025.

40|$|Phosphatase {{activities}} were investigated in Morganella morganii, {{which is one}} of the few enterobacterial species producing high-level phosphateirrepressible <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity (HPAP phenotype), and the gene encoding the major phosphate-irrepressible <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> was cloned, sequenced, and its product characterized. Using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, Morganella produced a major phosphate-irrepressible <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> (named PhoC) which is associated with the HPAP phenotype, a minor phosphate-irrepressible <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase,</b> and a phosphate-repressible alkaline phosphatase.

40|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{activities}} of the bone marrow and peripheral serum were measured in the patients with carcinoma of the prostate or benign hyperplasia diagnosed at the Department of Urology, Hiroshima University Hospital. The enzyme levels were comparatively examined with bone x-rays and bone scintigrams. 1) Three cases of benign hyperplasia all showed normal peripheral and bone marrow serum <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity. 2) In five cases (41. 7 %) of 12 stage C carcinoma of the prostate, prostatic <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> of the bone marrow-l was elevated.

40|$|Legionella pneumophila is an {{intracellular}} pathogen of protozoa and alveolar macrophages. This bacterium {{contains a}} gene (pilD) that {{is involved in}} both type IV pilus biogenesis and type II protein secretion. We previously demonstrated that the PilD prepilin peptidase is crucial for intracellular infection by L. pneumophila and that the secreted pilD-dependent proteins include a metalloprotease, an <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase,</b> an esterase/lipase, a phospholipase A, and a p-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine hydrolase.

Prostatic <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{has served as}} a tumor marker for metastatic {{prostate}} cancer for many years. We have cloned a new human <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> gene (named testicular <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase,</b> ACPT), which is expressed mainly in testis and to a lower extent in the prostate, trachea, and other tissues. This gene maps to chromosome 19 q 13. 4, in an area that harbors many cancer–related genes. The testicular <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> gene is composed of 11 exons, and the protein is predicted to have a luminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The N-terminal end of the protein encodes a signal peptide. The protein has approximately 50 % homology with both the prostatic and the lysosomal <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases,</b> and the position of the cysteine residues, the N-glycosylation sites, and the histidine catalytic site are conserved among the three proteins. The testicular <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> gene is up-regulated by androgens and is down-regulated by estrogens in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP.

40|$|This study {{represents}} {{the first example}} of immunological localization of lysosomal <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase.</b> The intracellular localization of lysosomal <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> was investigated with immunocytochemical methods at the light and electron microscopical level in cultured fibroblasts obtained from normal subjects and from a patient with I-cell disease. Double-labeling studies using fluorescence microscopy showed that <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{is present in the}} same organelles as other hydrolases. At the electron microscopic level in control fibroblasts <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, at the plasma membrane, in vesicles just below the plasma membrane and in multivesicular bodies. This localization was comparable with that of other lysosomal enzymes tested (acid alpha-glucosidase, N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase, beta-galactosidase). <b>Acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> labeling was mainly found in association with the lysosomal membrane and with membranous material present within the lysosome. In I-cell fibroblasts the label was present in the same subcellular organelles but always associated with membranous structures. We suggest that the association of <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> with membranes might explain the normal enzyme activity found in I-cell fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|An <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} and purified from an extract of a germinating black gram seedling. The method {{was accomplished by}} gel filtration of a germinating black gram seedling crude extract on sephadex G- 75 followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose. The <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> determined by SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis {{was estimated to be}} 25 kDa. The purified enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 5 and at temperature of 55 °C. Mg 2 +, Zn 2 + and EDTA had an inhibitory effect on the activity of the <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase.</b> Black gram seedling <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> was activated by K+, Cu 2 + and Ba 2 +. The Km value of the enzyme was found to be 0. 49 mM for pNPP as substrate...|$|R
25|$|Tartrate-resistant <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> (TRAP or TRAPase), {{also called}} <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5, {{tartrate}} resistant (ACP5), is a glycosylated monomeric metalloprotein enzyme expressed in mammals. It has a molecular weight of approximately 35kDa, a basic isoelectric point (7.6-9.5), and optimal activity in acidic conditions. TRAP is synthesized as latent proenzyme and activated by proteolytic cleavage and reduction. It is differentiated from other mammalian <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> by its resistance to inhibition by tartrate and molecular weight.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Chemical {{analysis}} {{has revealed that}} the seminal plasma of the chicken contains high levels of <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> {{and low levels of}} alkaline phosphatase. There were significant differences in the <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> levels of individual males, but not of different breeds. Analysis of various sections of the male reproductive system demon¬ strated high levels of the <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> in the vas deferens and epidi¬ dymis, and lesser but substantial amounts in the other sections tested...|$|R
