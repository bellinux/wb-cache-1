Euphemism, for instance, can be achieved antithetically by both hyperbole and understatement, {{by the use of}} learned terms or technical jargon instead of common terms, and conversely by the use of colloquial instead of formal terms, by both general-for-specific substitution and part-for-whole substitution, by both circumlocution and <b>abbreviation,</b> <b>acronym,</b> alphabetism or even complete omission, as well as by one-for-one substitution from the existing resources of the language or by borrowing from another language.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{describing how}} brand names with English in Indonesian products are created. To {{analyze the data}} found the researchers applied English word formation in English morphology. This is a descriptive research. The data were brand names using English found in Indonesian product which were taken from three supermarkets in Solo namely Hypermart Solo Grand Mall, Hypermart Gorro Assalam, and Carefur from February up to April 2010. The research found that the brand names with English in Indonesian products can be created by applying word formation such as compounding, blending, affixation, reduplication, onomatopoeia, <b>abbreviation,</b> <b>acronym</b> and clipping. The process of compounding consists of pure compounding and modification compounding, The process of blending includes the first syllable of the first words and the first syllable of the second words, the first syllable of the first words and the second syllable {{from the front of}} the second words., the first words and the last syllables of the second words, the first words and two syllables {{from the front of the}} second words, two syllables from the front of the first words and the second words, two syllables from the front of the first words and the first syllable of the second words, the first words and the two last syllables from the back of the second words, and the first words and the first syllables of the second words. The affixation process covers prefixes pro-, -bio and suffixes –y, - er, -ness, -ish, and –s. The process of reduplication includes pure modification, modification with intensifier meaning and reduplication with sound change. The process of abbreviation found is pure abbreviation and acronym. The process of clipping includes the clipping of letter and syllables...|$|E

A sense inventory {{is a collection of}} <b>abbreviations</b> and <b>acronyms</b> (short forms) with their possible senses (long forms), along with other corresponding information about these terms. For our comprehensive sense inventory for clinical <b>abbreviations</b> and <b>acronyms,</b> a total of 440 most frequently used <b>abbreviations</b> and <b>acronyms</b> were selected from 352, 267 dictated clinical notes. 949 senses of each <b>abbreviation</b> and <b>acronym</b> were manually annotated from 500 random instances within clinical notes and lexically aligned with 17, 359 long forms of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 5, 233 long forms of Another Database of Abbreviations in Medline (ADAM), and 4, 879 long forms in Stedman’s Medical <b>Abbreviations,</b> <b>Acronyms</b> & Symbols (4 th edition).

40|$|Text {{normalization}} is {{an important}} aspect of successful information retrieval from medical documents such as clinical notes, radiology reports and discharge summaries. In the medical domain, {{a significant part of the}} general problem of text normalization is <b>abbreviation</b> and <b>acronym</b> disambiguation. Numerous <b>abbreviations</b> are used routinely throughout such texts and knowing their meaning is critical to data retrieval from the document. In this paper I will demonstrate a method of automatically generating training data for Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling of <b>abbreviations</b> and <b>acronyms</b> and will show that using ME modeling is a promising technique for <b>abbreviation</b> and <b>acronym</b> normalization. I report on the results of an experiment involving training a number of ME models used to normalize <b>abbreviations</b> and <b>acronyms</b> on a sample of 10, 000 rheumatology notes with ~ 89 % accuracy. ...|$|R
