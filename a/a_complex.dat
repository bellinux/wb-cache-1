40|$|Protein {{phosphatase}} 2 A (PP 2 A) is a ubiquitous phospho-serine/threonine phosphatase {{that controls}} many diverse cellular functions. The predominant form of PP 2 A is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme {{consisting of a}} scaffolding A subunit, a variable regulatory B subunit, and a catalytic C subunit. The C subunit also associates with other interacting partners, such as α 4, to form non-canonical PP 2 <b>A</b> <b>complexes.</b> We report visualization of PP 2 <b>A</b> <b>complexes</b> in mammalian cells. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis of PP 2 A subunit interactions demonstrates that the B subunit {{plays a key role}} in directing the subcellular localization of PP 2 A, and confirms that the A subunit functions as a scaffold in recruiting the B and C subunits to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. BiFC analysis also reveals that α 4 promotes formation of the AC core dimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate visualization of specific ABC holoenzymes in cells by combining BiFC and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET).
