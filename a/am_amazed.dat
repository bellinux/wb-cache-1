500|$|A secco recitative, [...] "" [...] (I <b>am</b> <b>amazed),</b> expresses {{awe at the}} creation, {{rendered}} {{in the first person}} which according to Mincham underlines the cantata's [...] "personal and individual emphasis".

500|$|D'Argenlieu bluntly denounced Leclerc. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> – yes, {{that is the}} word, amazed", he said, [...] "that France's fine expeditionary corps in Indochina is {{commanded}} by officers who would rather negotiate than fight". D'Argenlieu stated that a higher level meeting in Paris would be required. He then unilaterally declared a French-controlled Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina without asking either Paris or the Vietnamese. In 1946, Leclerc was replaced as commander of the French forces by Jean-Étienne Valluy. At the time many French and American politicians were willing to believe that Ho {{was part of a}} Soviet plan to dominate the world, but Leclerc warned that [...] "anti-communism will be a useless tool unless the problem of nationalism is resolved." [...] His advice was simple: [...] "Negotiate at all costs!" ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{achieved}} a wider fame for his successful libel {{action against the}} BBC in {{what became known as}} [...] "the case of the intrusive H". In 1933, the BBC had printed in the 14 April edition of its magazine The Radio Times a letter from a retired schoolmaster who, having heard a broadcast of the St Matthew Passion, accused Wilson of the technical fault of aspirating his runs in decorated music: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> that the BBC could engage anyone quite so incompetent in his breath control. … 'Pilate's wife' became 'Pigh-highlet's wigh-highf'; 'High Priest' was turned into 'High-high Pree-heest'; 'Purple robe' into 'Purple ro-hobe'; 'to' into 'too-hoo', and so on throughout the entire performance. It was simply ghastly." [...] When Wilson complained, the BBC initially offered to publish an apology in The Radio Times, but then took exception when Wilson demanded £5,000 in damages.|$|E

2500|$|Some, like Urey, {{later came}} to realize Sagan's popular brand of {{scientific}} advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole. Urey especially liked Sagan's 1977 book, The Dragons of Eden, and wrote Sagan with his opinion: [...] "I like it very much and <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problem...I congratulate you...You are a man of many talents." ...|$|E

And then, all of a sudden, from one minute to the next, I became a man with an orderly life, a place of his own and a wife, an honest, and good working woman." [...] (Joseph Csaky) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{anonymously}} authored Hindutva Sex and Adventure {{is a novel}} {{featuring a}} main character with strong similarities to Tully. Tully himself has stated that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> that Roli Books should publish such thinly disguised plagiarism, and allow the author to hide in a cavalier manner behind a nom-de-plume. The book is clearly modelled on my career, even down to {{the name of the}} main character. That character's journalism is abysmal, and his views on Hindutva and Hinduism do not in any way reflect mine. I would disagree with them profoundly".|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{challenge}} a long-standing {{decision by the}} U.S. Supreme Court that had permitted movie censorship in eight states and 90 cities, Greb prepared a thesis calling for freedom of the movies. [...] He offered it to {{the law firm of}} Ephraim S. London, which was appealing the New York State Board of Regents' ban on exhibition of a controversial film called [...] "The Miracle." [...] At the time Greb, was a graduate student at Stanford University. [...] The result was a precedent-changing unanimous decision (9-0) protecting movies from censorship under the First Amendment in Burstyn v. Wilson, et al. (1952). [...] The decision overruled Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio that had upheld film censorship for more than 37 years. In thanking Greb for allowing him to quote his research in the oral argument, London wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> that someone who is not a lawyer could have had so clear a comprehension of the legal questions involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Media {{coverage}} of the spill was intense {{from the moment the}} oil reached the shore. [...] The spill was the major headline in many morning newspapers on February 5, also receiving wide coverage on radio and television. [...] The same morning, a U.S. Senate subcommittee interviewed local officials as well as Fred Hartley, president of Union Oil, on the disaster in the making. [...] Three major television networks were there along with over 50 reporters, the largest media turnout for any Senate subcommittee meeting since the Committee on Foreign Relations discussed the Vietnam War. [...] During the meeting, local officials made their case that the Federal government had a conflict of interest, in that they were making money from the same drilling they were mandated to oversee and regulate. [...] Hartley defended Union's record and denied that the event was a disaster: [...] "I don't like to call it a disaster, because there has been no loss of human life. [...] I <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> at the publicity for the loss of a few birds." [...] Most controversially, offshore drilling operations – all of which were suspended immediately on February 3, by direct request of the Walter Hickel Secretary of the Interior, pending a [...] "complete reevaluation and reassessment of the situation" [...] – had resumed after just a break of several hours, just long enough for a closed-door meeting between oil company representatives and Department of the Interior officials. [...] Local officials, not invited to the meeting, were furious that [...] "complete reevaluation and reassessment" [...] could have occurred in such a short time, and in a meeting that excluded them; the fierce exchange was covered on national television, along with grim footage of the thousands of dying birds on the tarred beaches of Santa Barbara, and the spontaneous efforts of hundreds of civilian volunteers to pile straw on the oil, scrub rocks with detergent, and struggle to save a few of the less-oiled birds.|$|E
