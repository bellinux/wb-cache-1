500|$|The episode {{has been}} well {{received}} by reviewers. TV Guide ranked it No. 7 on its list of the ten best Star Trek episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary. In a retrospective review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club praised the episode for quickly establishing the premise and stakes, as well as turning Tasha Yar's death {{into one of the}} episode's [...] "strongest emotional beats... Tasha's determination to die with meaning by the end of [...] transforms her from a misstep into something more noble and sad." [...] In contrast, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a [...] "TV death" [...] is the episode's major flaw: [...] "It is, in short, a scripted death, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> marionette strings", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is [...] "heavy, PhilipK. Dick-ian stuff that actually takes some thought to follow and... all victories come at a cost", and that it is a fan favorite episode for good reason. Likewise, Den of Geek reviewer James Hunt praised the episode for finding the human stakes in the story, elevating it above standard science fiction time travel stories.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{beginning}} {{development of}} Crash Nitro Kart, Vicarious Visions {{chief executive officer}} and chief creative officer Karthik Bala noted that Crash's physical appearance had been inconsistent since his debut in 1996 and decided to [...] "explore the original vision of the character" [...] {{in an attempt to}} bring him back to his roots. Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson were tracked down and enlisted for guidance during development of the game and were faced with the challenge of evolving the character and the franchise visually while retaining their [...] "cartoon-like charm". To redesign Crash and the other mainstay characters of the series for Crash Nitro Kart, the Vicarious Visions team reviewed a number of original development sketches from Zembillas's archives and then redesigned the main characters by incorporating details from the concept art and adding girth to the characters; Crash's appearance in the game, compared to the previous two games, sports a slightly larger nose, fuller eyebrows, and a far more textured body. Zembillas noted that [...] "Crash is slimmer and more appealing now. There's also more emphasis on his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> craftiness in his personality. That's Crash to me, and he's alive again in Nitro Kart".|$|E

He actually told the American government that I'm {{going to do this}} deal to try and prove to those within Pakistan, and in Pakistan's state apparatus, who think that these guys can be negotiated with — I will negotiate with them only to prove that you can't negotiate with them, because they will break the deal. And as soon as they broke the deal, the army is back in, the fighting is going on, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> results." ...|$|E

There are stones yonder, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> bruise,” said one. “Still, {{it might not have}} {{happened}} that way, {{and it seems to me}} we had better push on to the hall, and send somebody for the police.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The lighted way, dear," [...] he murmured, {{holding her}} a little more closely to him. [...] "While I am down in the city you can sit here and watch, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ships a long way further off than you could ever see them from Adam Street. You can see the bend, too. It's always easier, isn't it, to fancy that {{something}} is coming into sight around the corner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! Oh, no!" [...] said he {{who seemed}} to be Markham, with the {{optimism}} of an enthusiast. [...] "There's no trouble about it. We've got some shanties that we put up about the mouth of the hole in the ground we made in the autumn, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hole without digging at all.

6000|$|... 'O dear, yes, sir; I {{felt sure}} it would be summat good, it made me laugh so. He didn't think much of it; but I know a good thing when I see it;' {{and the old man}} gave an {{important}} nod, as if all the credit of the blessed 'Pickwick' belonged to him. 'He married Miss Hogarth while livin' here; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> room, if you like,' he added, with a burst of hospitality, as the almighty sixpence touched his palm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm just goin' {{to drive}} round {{the side of}} the house," [...] he said; [...] "at the back there's a little knoll where we can stop, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> whole of the barn with the three ways of gittin' into it, one for each story." [...] At that moment they rolled past the front piazza on which were Miriam and Ralph, gazing at them in surprise. The latter had risen when he had heard the {{approaching}} carriage, supposing they were to have visitors. But as the vehicle passed the door he looked at his sister in amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Countess Devorgilla {{built it}} as a shrine for her husband's heart, which was embalmed and buried on her breast. It's a moving story, when {{one thinks of}} what she undertook. Galloway was then, for the most part, a savage waste; skilled workmen must be brought from somewhere else, perhaps from Italy or France. Then there is only granite, {{which could not be}} cut and molded, on these hills, and the soft red stone had to be carried down the Firth and across the sands. They had no {{mechanical}} transport, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> size of the blocks. In spite of all this, the abbey rose and still stands, marked, I often think, by a tender, elusive beauty that's peculiar to the North." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then a {{nurse was}} soothing, [...] "All over! Perfect success! She'll come out fine! She'll be {{out from under}} the {{anesthetic}} soon, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> her." ...|$|R

6000|$|Here is {{a picture}} of it, daintily done,[7] <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pretty blue shield on its breast, perhaps, at this distance. Vain shield, if ever the fair little thing is wretched enough to set foot on English ground! I find the last that was seen was shot at Margate so long ago as 1842,--and {{there seems to be no}} {{official}} record of any visit before that, since Mr. Thomas Embledon shot one on Newcastle town moor in 1816. But this rarity of visit to us is strange; other birds have no such clear objection to being shot, and really seem to come to England expressly for the purpose. And yet this blue-bird--(one can't say [...] "blue robin"--I think we shall have to call him [...] "bluet," [...] like the cornflower)--stays in Sweden, where it sings so sweetly that it is called [...] "a hundred tongues." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now for {{the economy}} of beauty. Our friend must make his prayer to the Graces,--for, if they cannot save him, nobody can. One thing John has to begin with, that rare gift to man, a wife with the magic cestus of Venus,--not around her waist, but, if such a thing could be, in her finger-ends. All that she touches falls at once into harmony and proportion. Her eye for color and form is intuitive: let her arrange a garret, with nothing but boxes, barrels, and cast-off {{furniture}} in it, and ten to one she makes it seem the most attractive place in the house. It is a veritable [...] "gift of good faërie," [...] this tact of beautifying and arranging, that some women have; and, on the present occasion, it has a real, material value, that can be estimated in dollars and cents. Come with us <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pair taking their survey of the yet unfurnished parlors, as busy and happy as a couple of bluebirds picking up the first sticks and straws for their nest.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{shops are}} shown. Their fronts are richly {{decorated}} with [...] carved wood painted red and profusely gilt. The counters are [...] elaborately carved. Outside are huge sign-boards. The shops are [...] {{open to the}} street <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> various wares they sell. One [...] is a coffin shop, where the coolies are {{at work on a}} coffin: other [...] coffins, ready for sale, are displayed; some of them are of plain [...] deal, others are rich, with black and gold. The next shop is a [...] money changer's. Then there is a lantern shop in which all manner [...] of coloured lanterns are hanging. After this comes a druggist where [...] there are queer things in bottles and dried herbs. A small stuffed [...] crocodile is a prominent object. Next to this is a shop where [...] crockery is sold, large coloured jars, plates, and all manner of [...] strange animals. In all the shops two or three Chinamen are seated. [...] Some read newspapers through great horn spectacles; some smoke [...] water pipes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{turn about}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{perfectly}} well, but {{stay where you}} are till he comes back," [...] commanded Thorny, as signs of commotion appeared in the excited audience.|$|R

60|$|The {{next thing}} I must shew you is, {{that it really}} does {{dissolve}} a little in water, and therefore that it is unlike oxygen and hydrogen in that respect I have here an apparatus by which we can produce this solution. In {{the lower part of}} this apparatus is marble and acid, and in the upper part cold water. The valves are so arranged that the gas can get from one to the other. I will set it in action now, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> gas bubbling up through the water, as it has been doing all night long, and by this time we shall find that we have this substance dissolved in the water. If I take a glass and draw off some of the water, I find that it tastes a little acid to the mouth: it is impregnated with carbonic acid; and if I now apply a little lime-water to it, that will give us a test of its presence. This water will make the lime-water turbid and white, which is proof of the presence of carbonic acid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Evidently she does. I rather {{think she}} is in for a surprise. Now, Stillwell, you are clever <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> situation. I want my guests to enjoy their stay here, but I do not want that {{to be at the}} expense of the {{feelings}} of all of us, or even any one. Helen will bring a lively crowd. They'll crave excitement--the unusual. Let us see that they are not disappointed. You take the boys into your confidence. Tell them what to expect, and tell them how to meet it. I shall help you in that. I want the boys to be on dress-parade when they are off duty. I want them to be on their most elegant behavior. I do not care what they do, what measures they take to protect themselves, what tricks they contrive, so long as they do not overstep the limit of kindness and courtesy. I want them to play their parts seriously, naturally, as if they had lived no other way. My guests expect to have fun. Let us meet them with fun. Now what do you say?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now what I {{particularly}} wish {{to insist}} upon, {{is the state}} of vision in which all the details of an object are seen, and yet seen in such confusion and disorder that we cannot in the least tell what they are, or what they mean. It is not mist between us and the object, still less is it shade, still less is it want of character; it is a confusion, a mystery, an interfering of undecided lines with each other, not a diminution of their number; window and door, architrave and frieze, all are there: it is no cold and vacant mass, it is full and rich and abundant, and yet you cannot see a single form so as to know what it is. Observe your friend's face as he is coming up to you; first it {{is nothing more than a}} white spot; now it is a face, but you cannot see the two eyes, nor the mouth, even as spots; you see a confusion of lines, a something which you know from experience to be indicative of a face, and yet you cannot tell how it is so. Now he is nearer, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> spots for the eyes and mouth, but they are not blank spots neither; there is detail in them; you cannot see the lips, nor the teeth, nor the brows, and yet you see more than mere spots; it is a mouth and an eye, and there is light and sparkle and expression in them, but nothing distinct. Now he is nearer still, and you can see that he is like your friend, but you cannot tell whether he is or not; there is a vagueness and indecision of line still. Now you are sure, but even yet there are a thousand things in his face which have their effect in inducing the recognition, but which you cannot see so as to know what they are.|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{turned to}} Waynefleet. [...] "We'll lay you {{off for a}} week. There's a little {{business}} waiting at the settlement, anyway, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> about getting the new tools and provisions in." ...|$|R
60|$|RUFIO (sitting {{down on the}} altar). Very well. Then {{my place}} is here too; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> what is the matter for yourself. The city is in a pretty uproar, it seems.|$|R
