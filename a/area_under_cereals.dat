At times of strong demand and remunerative prices for milk, sheepmeat, beef and wool, the comparative advantage of New Zealand producers of these products over those in other countries has justified the general lack of any strong concern {{for the development of the}} arable sector. When, however, the market for livestock and livestock products is weak, the further expansion of other farm products, including cereals, becomes a much more attractive proposition. It is not perhaps always appreciated that the proportion of total agricultural land in New Zealand devoted to cereal production is very small. Over the past decade, the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereals</b> has fluctuated around 200, 000 ha with the trend over these years being slowly downwards, from an average of 210, 000 ha during the five year period 1973 - 77 to an average of 190, 000 over the period 1979 - 83 (although the 1983 - 84 out turn has shown a sharp reversal of this trend).

40|$|The {{marketing}} of farm {{inputs and outputs}} {{has become a major}} problem for farmers in Pakistan. Farm input supplies are irregular, characterized by shortages and high prices at critical times. This report reviews the input and output policies for cereals implemented in Pakistan during the period 1996 – 2010. Pakistan has a long and varied history of intervening in farm input and output markets, going back decades before the period under review. Most significantly, in the wake of economic reforms launched during the 1980 s, it has withdrawn from most of the commodity markets except wheat. In other commodity markets, intervention is by and large notional and without much practical involvement. The rolling back of the public sector from markets has certainly saved public funds, but the savings have come at a cost. Some of the cost, in terms of higher prices and variability stemming from the uncertain economic environment and supply, is borne by consumers, and some, in terms of lower producer prices at harvest, is borne by farmers, especially small and medium farmers, whose farms account for more than 50 percent of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereals.</b> Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; Theme 9; Subtheme 9. 1; GRP 1; CSISAEPT...|$|E

Data collected through the three-stage stratified random sampling technique have been used to analyze the impact of diversification and commercialization over time. The average farm-size has reduced from 0. 80 hectares to 0. 59 hectares during this period. The cereal-dominated cropping pattern has been replaced by vegetable-based cropping pattern, the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereal</b> crops being declined from 59 per cent to 5 per cent. The cropping intensity has increased from 197 to 225 per cent. Cauliflower, cabbage and tomato are the major crops occupying the total cropped area. As the vegetable crops are highly labour-intensive, the annual labour requirement has increased by about 49 per cent. The labour requirement during kharif, rabi and zaid seasons has increased from 98. 9, 90. 0 and 10. 0 mandays in period-I (1990 - 91) to 115. 5, 113. 8 and 64. 0 mandays, respectively in period-II (2002 - 03).

30|$|The Great Hungarian Plain in Hungary {{benefits}} from these natural features that provide favorable conditions for agriculture: fertile plains, an advantageous climate, availability of water. Under these environmental conditions {{the most important}} natural hazards are connected to climatic variability, the low relief, the orographic characteristic (basin situation), the land cover types (the main land cover types are arable land, pasture, and broad-leaved forest), and land use practices (for example, agriculture, grazing or deforestation). Natural hazards {{in this area are}} caused by the irregular water balance, since annual precipitation is highly variable—the observed minimum value was 203  mm (at Szeged meteorological station in 2000), the maximum was 1, 555  mm (at Miskolc–Lillafüred–Jávorkút meteorological station in 2010) (HMS 2013). In humid years excess water can induce floods and inland excess water inundations, while in dry years lack of water can cause drought and increase wind erosion events. These hazards highly affect the natural environment and land owners of the region. The economic loss caused by these natural hazards can reach 2 – 6  % of the GDP, depending on the duration, intensity, and occurrence and co-occurrence of different hazards (Bakonyi 2010).

40|$|The European Commission {{released}} its {{review of the}} 'Prospects for Agricultural Markets in the European Union 2003 - 2010 ' in June 2003. In the cereals sector the report projected a 'relatively fragile' situation. The recent rise in cereal imports and domestic EU production, combined with a lower than expected expansion of cereal exports (in part {{accounted for by the}} rising value of the Euro against the US $) will lead to a significant growth in cereals stocks over the 2002 / 2003 period. Stocks are then likely to remain high as production expands and demand remains constrained by only a moderate expansion of EU animal production Increases in yields will more than off-set the decline in the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereals.</b> EU exports are expected to average around 30 million tonnes over the medium term (with a projection of exports at 31. 3 million tonnes in 2010 as opposed to 19. 9 million tonnes in 2001). The EU- 15 wheat sector is expected to show strong gains, with production up from 103. 3 million tonnes in 2002 to 113. 9 million tonnes in 2010 and exports up from 16. 5 million in 2002 to 18. 8 million in 2010. While most of this increased production will be absorbed within the domestic EU market, a steady growth in exports at world market prices is expected. Comment: The increased exports of wheat at world market prices (i. e. without any WTO constraints) is potentially the most serious development that is of concern to ACP countries, since it is also likely to fuel exports of competitively priced EU wheat-based products. It should be borne in mind, however, that these are projections and not projects, with considerable uncertainty arising from exchange-rate variations; the export capacity of newly emerging exporting regions (Black Sea countries and Brazil); the level of global economic recovery; the outcome of the Doha Development Round; and the final impact of the CAP compromise agreement.

40|$|The {{adjustment}} of Finnish agriculture to the EU membership has largely gone as was expected, {{except that the}} market prices have been somewhat lower than was forecast before joining the EU. This was partly caused by the strengthening of Finnish markka, but the prices of beef, mutton, and eggs have been clearly below the average levels in the EU. Overproduction {{may be one reason}} for the collapse in the price of eggs, {{but in the case of}} beef and especially mutton there is no excess supply that might affect the prices. Livestock production, in particular, has stayed at about the same level as in 1994. The <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereals</b> grew to some extent, mainly due to the considerable decrease in the required set-aside area. Trade between Finland and the other member states increased as was expected. Especially meat imports increased considerably from the earlier levels. This was made possible by the fact that the decrease in the consumer prices (about 9 % by the end of 1995) led to an increase in the consumption of pigmeat and poultry meat. The trade in dairy products, like cheeses and yoghurt, increased as well. Some decrease occurred in the food imports to Russia and Estonia. During a transitional period of five years a degressive support is paid to agriculture, and in the first year this was quite high. The purpose of the support is to alleviate the {{adjustment of}} farms to the toughening competition in the single market. Because of the support, farm income stayed at about the same level as earlier. Farmers managed the first year as EU members quite well, even if some of the support was postponed to be paid in 1996. Income development looks relatively good still in 1996, but in the long run the situation is likely to be much more difficult. The first year as EU members was characterized by delays in the decisions on support, which led to uncertainty about the income development among farmers. Farmers had to learn to operate in a new bureaucratic system, but things have started to run quite smoothly. Support for the transitional period will keep the incomes at a satisfactory level, but the future involves a great deal of uncertainty. vMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{information}} available in September 2002 this update seeks to incorporate the anticipated effects of the US Farm Bill {{on the development of}} agricultural markets in the EU, Eastern Europe and internationally for meat, cereals (including rice) and dairy products. The market situation for EU cereals is projected to continue to be favourable, with the exception of rye and barley. Severe drops in production levels - mainly driven by unfavourable climatic conditions in North America and Australia - have triggered a strong rally in market prices in the cereals sector. The impact of this however will be short term. An expansion of EU production of common wheat, durum wheat and maize is projected, with increased yields more than off-setting the decline in <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereals.</b> EU cereal production is expected to reach 224. 7 million tonnes in 2009 (up from 213. 3 million tonnes in 2000 and a peak of 180 million tonnes in the pre CAP reform period). EU cereal exports are expected to rise above 30 million tonnes by 2005, reaching 32. 5 million tonnes in 2009. This export level will exceed the annual limit on subsidised exports {{largely as a result of}} unsubsidised exports of both durum wheat and common wheat. EU wheat exports in 2009 are expected to be around 33 % higher than in 2000 (19. 6 million tonnes compared to 14. 3 million tonnes). A steady growth in domestic and international demand for both common wheat and durum wheat is anticipated over the next seven years, with the EU market situation therefore remaining tight. The EU's expansion of cereals production will largely be taken up by the domestic animal-feed industry. With reference to the impact of the US Farm Bill the potentially negative impact on wheat prices will, it is felt, be off-set in the medium term by more favourable market conditions than previously expected, although the price-depressing impact will be more marked for maize. A continued imbalance in the rice sector is anticipated, with the situation becoming critical after 2006. Comment: The figures contained in the report clearly show the extent to which CAP reform in the cereals sector is allowing an expansion of EU production and a resurgence in EU exports. It also shows the extent to which cereals-sector reform is enhancing the competitiveness of those meat-product exports which make extensive use of cereal-based animal feed. For example poultry exports are projected to peak and remain at around 1 million tonnes throughout the period from 2003 to 2009, a sharp increase from around 400, 000 tonnes in the pre-cereal-sector reform period. This highlights how the move to 'less trade-distorting' forms of support is having some rather strange trade effects. On {{the basis of}} information available in September [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In its {{executive}} summary to its report on 'Impact Assessment of the Mid-term Review Proposals on Agricultural Markets and Farm Incomes 2004 - 2009 ' the European Commission highlights that the mid-term review proposals would lead to: {{a reduction in}} the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>cereals</b> by around 2. 5 %; a constraining of cereal production; lower production and higher domestic prices for cereals; a 25 % decline in cereals stocks; a decline in beef production, with increased slaughtering in the short term, followed by declining production and higher prices; a decline in area under silage as a result of declining beef production; a decline in EU beef exports by around 100, 000 tonnes; trends in poultry and pig meat production which rise when beef prices rise and fall when beef prices decline. The commission maintains that the MTR proposals will provide greater flexibility and more market orientation to farmers, while guaranteeing a stable income. The distinct impression is created of declining EU cereals production {{as a result of the}} mid-term review. This was certainly the conclusion of the Reuters reporter Jeremy Smith in his report of January 10 th based on advanced leaking of the main conclusions of the studies when he wrote: 'EU cereals production was also expected to decline as a result of de-coupling and the cut in support prices'. This is an understandable conclusion to draw when the Commission Report on 'Agricultural Markets and Revenues in the EU 15 and in the EU- 25 using the ESIM Model' in {{its executive}} summary states: 'The proposed MTR measures on EU- 15 markets would reduce overall cereals production in 2006 from 218 million tonnes in baseline to 210. 8 million tonnes in market'. This report further highlights that: rye prices would be significantly lower in the EU- 15; barley prices would be between € 95 - 100 /tonne; wheat prices will stay above current intervention prices. It is maintained that the application of the 'dynamic modulation' concept would have only limited effects on production, although it would shift production towards higher yielding crops such as soft wheat and maize, which would lead to an increase of 0. 9 million tonnes in these crops with the implementation of dynamic modulation. Modulation would however have larger effects in the beef sector, because under the current regime production specific premiums make up a larger proportion of farm revenues. Production would contract in response to the elimination of these premia. Beef production is estimated to be 200, 000 tonnes lower with reform than without reform. De-coupling would make production of less competitive cereals such as rye, hard wheat and barley less attractive. In the beef sector de-coupling would lead to a drop in production of 5. 7 % compared to the no reform scenario, while prices would increase 6. 7 %. Similar trends would dominate in the EU- 25. Using structural models of the EU and world markets FAPRI sought to simulate the impact of the MTR proposals compared to a continuation of existing policies in 2004 and 2009. The key findings are that: for most major commodities the MTR proposals would result in a modest reduction in EU production; it would lead to sharp reductions in marginal production incentives in the livestock sector and significant reductions in cattle and sheep stocks; the major changes for rice and rye would lead to large reductions in market price and carry-over stocks; reduction intervention stocks would lead to small reductions in EU barley prices; EU soft wheat prices would be supported at above intervention price levels by world market prices and the proposed reforms would thus have little effect; after a short transition period the MTR proposals would reduce EU net exports of most other commodities and as a consequence there would be a slight increase in world market prices for a number of commodities. Two other studies, ('Mid-term Review Proposal Impact Analysis with the CAPRI Modelling System' and 'Impact Analysis of the European Commission's Proposal Under the Mid-term Review of the CAP using the CAPSIM model'), using different models, with slight variations, broadly support the findings outlined above. The report by the Centre for World Food Studies (Amsterdam) 'CAP Reform Proposal of the Mid-term Review: De-coupling with Strings Attached' points out that: the current proposals are primarily designed to solve 'the problems in the rye and rice regimes, where substantial surpluses are currently building up'; introduce changes in the way aid is given towards a more de-coupled system. Overall it argues that the new system will establish 'rights to subsidised production, with subsidy rates that are to a large extent harmonised across eligible crops'. Comment: The Commission's presentations of these studies major findings are in certain areas somewhat misleading. The key points to note in this regard are that: the reduction in cereals production is not in comparison to current production levels but in comparison with the baseline scenario which assumes a continuation of current policies until 2009; the figures are for cereals as a whole, with individual products having somewhat different trends, depending on the study. Thus if one disaggregates the effects of cereals-sector reform and looks at individual products in comparison to current levels of production a rather different impression of the direction of EU production under the mid-term review proposals is obtained. Looking at the figures contained in the FAPRI study for example in comparison to the current levels of EU production as set out in the June 2002 edition of the European Commission's 'Prospects for Agricultural Markets 2002 - 2009 ' one reaches the following conclusions in the cereals sectors: an 11. 3 % increase in soft wheat production by 2009 compared to 2002; a 3. 2 % increase in maize production by 2009 compared to 2002; a 6. 2 % increase in barley production by 2009 compared to 2002; a 4. 6 % increase in durum wheat production by 2009 compared to 2002; a 20. 1 % increase in rice production by 2009 compared to 2002. Only in the rye sector is there a decline in EU production (by 13 %) by 2009 compared to 2002. In the livestock sector looking at the figures contained in the FAPRI study for example in comparison to the current levels of EU production as set out in the June 2002 edition of the European Commission's 'Prospects for Agricultural Markets 2002 - 2009 ' one reaches the following conclusions: a decline in beef production of 7. 4 % by 2009 compared to 2002; an increase in pork production of 2. 2 % by 2009 compared to 2002; a decline in poultry meat production of 0. 8 % by 2009 compared to 2002. This would be accompanied by the following effects on exports: a decline in beef exports of 14. 3 % by 2009 compared to 2002; an increase in pork exports of 22. 5 % by 2009 compared to 2002; an increase of 9. 8 % in poultry meat exports by 2009 compared to 2002. It should be noted that trends in the pig and poultry sectors are related to developments in the beef sector, with higher beef prices stimulating pig and poultry consumption and lower beef prices leading to a contraction of domestic consumption.

We interviewed 20 students in the first semester and 15 students from the same cohort in the second semester of a calculus-based physics course sequence on several problems involving the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve concept. We found {{that only a few}} students could recognize that the concept of <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve was applicable in physics problems. Even when students could invoke the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve concept, they did not necessarily understand the relationship between the process of accumulation and the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve, so they failed to apply it to novel situations. We also found that when presented with several graphs, students had difficulty in selecting the graph such that the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the graph corresponded to a given integral, although all of them could state that “the integral equaled the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve. ” The findings in this study are consistent with those in previous mathematics education research and research in physics education on students’ use of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve...|$|R
