5|$|Those {{with either}} {{definite}} pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no clearly visible lesions are {{deemed to be}} at risk from brain emboli. They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> during intravenous therapy.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard {{stated in}} his eighteen-page after-action {{report that he}} had {{intended}} to force the submarine to surface {{so that it could}} be attacked by the surface vessels' guns. He reported that his vessel had seen oil on the surface, though the PC-815 took no samples, and asserted that the blimps had seen <b>air</b> <b>bubbles,</b> oil and a periscope, though the blimps' own reports did not corroborate this. No wreckage was seen, despite the heavy depth-charging. The PC-815 sustained some minor damage and three crew were injured during the incident when the ship's radio antenna was accidentally hit by gunfire. At midnight on 21 May, with depth charges exhausted and the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, PC-815 was ordered back to Astoria.|$|E
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrapped in another liquid media find many practical applications in engineering and science (e. g. <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> formation in molten metal during metallurgic processes, <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment at hydraulic jumps, self-aeration of free jets and slug flow when gas formation within slug occurs). The study of motion of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{may lead to}} understand and control the highly complex processes like nucleate boiling and safety of nuclear reactors. Therefore {{it is clear that}} the study of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> motion in any liquid medium plays an important role to avoid defects and to enhance the efficiency of various engineering processes. In the present dissertation, a numerical investigation has been made to study the behavior of entrapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> and to understand the combined effect of jet force and buoyancy on it. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) with 3 D Volume of Fluid (VOF) model has been adopted to formulate/simulate the present problem. Different combinations of Reynolds number, initial position of bubble and number of bubbles have been considered for better understanding about the mobility of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in water. The effects of various fluid properties and turbulence on its motion and shape have also been studied. For each of the case studies, the contours of phases, velocity and velocity vectors have been evaluated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{entrainment}} in open channels {{is called}} 'white waters'. It is observed in supercritical turbulent flows. The <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> diffusion process is analysed both analytically and experimentally in uniform equilibrium flows. The {{solution of the}} diffusion equation is compared with model and prototype data. The {{results indicate that the}} turbulent diffusivity is of the same order of magnitude as the momentum transfer coefficient (i. e. eddy viscosity.).

5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{detachment}} {{force of}} an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{from the surface}} of coals of the ranks: 31. 1, 31. 2, 32. 1 and 32. 2 were carried out. The coal surface was precovered with n-alkane film in the homo logous series from n-hexane to n-hexadecane. The forces were compared with those calculated theoretically {{on the basis of the}} previously determined values of the surface free energy components and of the contact angles measured in a coal/n-alkane film - <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> - water system. On the basis of the conducted measurements and calculations we confirmed that the stability of the coal/n-alkane film - <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> - water systems depends on the rank of the coal studied, the thickness and kind of the hydrocarbon film present on the coal surface, and on the water film pressure under the <b>air</b> <b>bubble.</b> We also confirmed that the stability of n-alkane films on the surface of the coals studied is smaller than the stability of these films on the surface of typical hydrophobic solids. By comparison of the measured and calculated stabilities of the coal/n-alkane film - <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> - water system it appeared that the stabilities of such systems may be predicted on the basis of the contact angle of the coal/n-alkane film - <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> - water system and of the dispersion and nondispersion components of the surface free energy of coal...|$|R
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E
25|$|A {{large piece}} of {{compressed}} ice, or a glacier, appears blue, as large quantities of water appear blue. This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue. The other reason for the blue color of glaciers {{is the lack of}} <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>bubbles,</b> which give a white color to ice, are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice.|$|E
25|$|The air {{entrainment}} {{occurs in the}} form of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and air packets entrapped at the impingement of the upstream jet flow with the roller. The air packets are broken up in very small <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> as they are entrained in the shear region, characterised by large air contents and maximum bubble count rates. Once the entrained bubbles are advected into regions of lesser shear, bubble collisions and coalescence lead to larger air entities that are driven towards the free-surface by a combination of buoyancy and turbulent advection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: With each {{swallow a}} certain amount of air is transported to the stomach. The stomach protects itself against {{excessive}} distention by swallowed air through belching (gas reflux). The mechanism of belching (transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation) {{is also one of the}} mechanisms underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux. Aim: To investigate whether swallowing of air leads to an increase in size of the intragastric <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> and to gastro-oesophageal reflux. Methods: Multichannel intraluminal impedance mea-surement was used to quantify the incidence of swallowing of air in 20 healthy volunteers before and after a meal. Radiography was used to measure the size of the intragastric <b>air</b> <b>bubble.</b> Gastro-oesophageal reflux was assessed by concurrent impedance and pH measurement. Results: The rate of air swallowing was correlated to the size of the intragastric <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> postprandially and to the rate of gaseous gastro-oesophageal reflux. The number of air swallows and the size of the intra-gastric <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> did not correlate with the number of liquid acid and non-acid reflux episodes. Conclusions: In healthy subjects, air swallowing pro-motes belching but does not facilitate acid reflux...|$|R
