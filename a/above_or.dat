30|$|Multiple {{regression}} {{was used}} in this study to investigate the relationship between the reading literacy achievement of grade 4 students and their reading motivation, self-efficacy, and several home literacy environment variables, while controlling for gender and student’s literacy level when starting school. Regression was run separately for student who took the assessment in Arabic and English. The same multiple regression model was also run among those students with different reading ability levels. In PIRLS 2011, students with a score of 625 <b>or</b> <b>above,</b> 550 <b>or</b> <b>above,</b> 475 <b>or</b> <b>above,</b> and 400 <b>or</b> <b>above</b> were classified as the advanced, high, intermediate, and low reading ability groups (Mullis et al. 2009). Total student weight was applied.|$|R
30|$|This was {{an outcome}} {{variable}} in the multilevel analysis. In PIRLS 2011, students’ reading ability was defined on a four-point scale as international benchmarks {{in terms of their}} reading scores on the reading attainment test (Mullis et al. [2009]). Specifically, students with a score of 625 <b>or</b> <b>above,</b> 550 <b>or</b> <b>above,</b> 475 <b>or</b> <b>above,</b> and 400 <b>or</b> <b>above</b> were regarded as reaching the advanced, high, intermediate, and low international benchmarks, respectively. In this study, all students in the Hong Kong SAR sample were classified into three categories (i.e., readers with high proficiency, average readers, and readers with low proficiency) according to their international benchmark score. In this study, readers with high proficiency were students who achieved the advanced or high international benchmark (at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> 550), average readers were students who achieved the intermediate international benchmark (at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> 475 but below 550), and readers with low proficiency were those students whose scores set them at or below the low international benchmark (below 475).|$|R
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, <b>above</b> (<b>or,</b> infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement <b>above</b> <b>or</b> below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle.

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far <b>above</b> <b>or</b> below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E

Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, <b>above</b> <b>or</b> below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, <b>above</b> <b>or</b> beside the listener's ears.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from <b>above,</b> <b>or</b> find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E

Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the next-of-kin.|$|E
5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (lower leg joints). Adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. Adults are usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays eggs in a gelatinous mass, attaching them <b>above</b> <b>or</b> below the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch in a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written <b>above</b> <b>or</b> below the base line depending on what precedes them, and 𐐮 is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
