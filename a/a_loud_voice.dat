5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice,</b> and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E

5|$|Sarumpaet {{was born}} on 16 July 1949 in Tarutung, North Tapanuli Regency, North Sumatra. She was the fifth of ten {{children}} born to Saladin Sarumpaet, Minister of Defence in the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebel government, and Julia Hutabarat, a women's rights activist. Both were also prominent in the Christian community. Three of her siblings– Mutiara Sani, Riris Sarumpaet and Sam Sarumpaet– {{are members of the}} Indonesian art community. As a teenager she moved to Jakarta to study there, finishing her high school studies at PSKD Menteng. In his biography, her classmate Chrisye recalled that Sarumpaet was very confident; he noted that she enjoyed writing poetry and then reading it in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> while other students were engaging in other activities.|$|E
5|$|McKnight {{was born}} in Cranbury Township in the colonial Province of New Jersey in 1750. His only sibling was his younger brother, Richard. His father, also named Charles McKnight, emigrated to the colonies from Ireland {{sometime}} around 1740 and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1742. He became a minister of some note, {{and was one of}} the founders and trustees of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Reverend McKnight opposed British governance in Colonial America and was <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> for opposition and overthrow of the British government in New Jersey. According to Martha J. Lamb, Reverend McKnight received a severe saber cut to his head in the slashing melee that mortally wounded General Hugh Mercer at the Battle of Princeton. His church at Middletown Point was burned in 1777 and Reverend McKnight was arrested. While in custody aboard the British prison ship HMS Jersey in New York City, Rev. McKnight's health rapidly failed, and he was released shortly before his death on January 1, 1778.|$|E
25|$|After {{the murder}} of Pertinax (28 March 193), the Praetorian assassins {{announced}} that the throne was {{to be sold to}} the man who would pay the highest price. Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus, prefect of the city, father-in-law of the murdered emperor, being at that moment in the camp to which he had been sent to calm the troops, began making offers, whereupon Julianus, having been roused from a banquet by his wife and daughter, arrived in all haste, and being unable to gain admission, stood before the gate, and with <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> competed for the prize.|$|E

25|$|That morning, Colonel Israel Angell's 2nd Rhode Island Regiment was ferried {{across the}} Delaware from Fort Mifflin to assist Greene's 1st Rhode Island Regiment. Altogether, Greene {{commanded}} about 500 defenders. Soon afterward, a Hessian drummer beat a parley and Major Charles Stuart, {{accompanied by a}} Hessian officer, came forward to demand the fort's surrender. Greene sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeremiah Olney to meet the British major. Though Stuart threatened in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> that no quarter would {{be given to the}} defenders, Olney refused. Du Plessis later related to François-Jean de Chastellux that Stuart's overbearing tone inspired the defenders to greater resistance.|$|E
25|$|The hymn is {{of great}} antiquity, and perhaps much older than the event {{assigned}} by the Greek Menology as connected to its origin. The tradition recounts that {{during the reign of}} Theodosius II (408-450), Constantinople was shaken by a violent earthquake, 24 September, and that whilst the people, the emperor and the Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople (434-446) were praying for heavenly assistance, a child was suddenly lifted into midair, to whom all cried out Kyrie eleison ('Lord, have mercy'). The child was then seen to descend again to the earth, and in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> he exhorted the people to pray : 'Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal'. After giving this exhortation, the child died.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

25|$|There were testimonies of {{sightings}} of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews {{stayed in the}} smoking room for some time, then continued assisting with the evacuation. At around 2:00a.m., he was seen back on the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but there were still women reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and {{to draw attention to}} himself, Andrews waved his arms and announced to them in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to cling to in the water, though he may have been mistaken for chief baker Charles Joughin, who survived the sinking and reported doing the same thing. He then headed towards the bridge, perhaps in search of Captain Smith. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship in its final moments. His body was never recovered.|$|E
25|$|In his sixty-sixth year he {{once more}} {{displayed}} {{something of the}} energy of his triumphant youth. Night and day he laboured to levy armies and equip fleets. Fortunately for him, the Swedish government delayed hostilities in Scania until February 1644, and the Danes {{were able to make}} adequate defensive preparations and save the important fortress of Malmö. The Danish fleet denied Torstensson crossing from Jutland to Funen, and defeated the Dutch auxiliary fleet which came to Torstensson's assistance at the Action of 16 May 1644. Another attempt to transport Torstensson and his army to the Danish islands by a large Swedish fleet was frustrated by Christian IV in person on 1 July 1644. On that day the two fleets encountered at the Battle of Colberger Heide. As Christian stood on the quarter-deck of the Trinity a cannon close by was exploded by a Swedish cannonball, and splinters of wood and metal wounded the king in thirteen places, blinding one eye and flinging him to the deck. But he was instantly on his feet again, cried with <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice</b> that it was well with him, and set every one an example of duty by remaining on deck till the fight was over. Darkness at last separated the contending fleets; and the battle was drawn.|$|E
25|$|Meri was a kind-hearted and {{beautiful}} lady and Phra Rothasen {{lived with her}} very happily for some time, but he remembered his blind mother and aunts who still stayed in the dark cave. While showing him the palace, Meri had told Rothasen about certain magic medicines kept in a locked room including Phra Rothasen's mother and aunts's eyes. Then he made a plan to get Meri to sleep by making her drink wine and take the eyes for his mother and aunts. Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the eyes from the locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> <b>voice.</b> To stop her, Phra Rothasen threw a magic branch that turned the space between them into a deep lake and a high mountain. Seeing her husband escape from her Meri wailed in despair, asking him to stop. Phra Rothasen was moved by her sad screams and replied that he will back after he finished his urgent mission. Then Phra Rothasen flew away and left Meri with a broken heart crying bitterly at {{the shore of the}} lake.|$|E

I don't think it's right" [...] (although O'Casey was in fact living at the time). In letters written in the 1940s, Salinger had expressed his admiration of three living, or recently deceased, writers: Sherwood Anderson, Ring Lardner, and F. Scott Fitzgerald; Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as [...] "Fitzgerald's successor". Salinger's [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" [...] has an ending similar to that of Fitzgerald's earlier published short story [...] "May Day".|$|E
