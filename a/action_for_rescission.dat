App. Div. 1991), {{commonly}} known as the Ghostbusters ruling, is a case in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, that held that a house, which the owner had previously advertised to the public as haunted by ghosts, legally was haunted for the purpose of an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>rescission</b> brought by a subsequent purchaser of the house. Because of its unique holding, the case has been frequently printed in textbooks on contracts and property law and widely taught in U.S. law school classes, and is often cited by other courts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{absence of}} a rule, the VwGO is {{supplemented}} by the code of civil procedure (Zivilprozessordnung ZPO) and the judicature act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz GVG). In addition to the regulation of the administrative procedure, the VwVfG also constitutes the legal protection in administrative law beyond the court procedure. § 68 VwVGO rules the preliminary proceeding, called [...] "Vorverfahren" [...] or [...] "Widerspruchsverfahren", which is a stringent prerequisite for the administrative procedure, if an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>rescission</b> or a writ of mandamus against an authority is aimed. The preliminary proceeding gives each citizen, feeling unlawfully mistreated by an authority, the possibility to object and to force a review of an administrative act without going to court. The prerequisites to open the public law remedy are listed in § 40 I VwGO. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have the existence of a conflict in public law [...] without any constitutional aspects and no assignment to another jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|Taking {{a literal}} approach, this could mean - and the {{building}} societies were trying to argue - that any claim to rescind a contract (i.e. have it made void) would not be assigned by investors to the Scheme, whether it was <b>for</b> <b>rescission</b> based on a claim in undue influence, or any other claim. The building societies were trying to argue this, because {{if there was no}} valid assignment, then ICS would not be empowered to sue them.

40|$|The Common European Sales Law (CESL) {{sets the}} {{conditions}} in which the mistaken party is entitled to rescission and compensation from the other party. Some of the CESL 2 ̆ 7 s provisions, however, are inconsistent with efficiency. First, under the CESL, as long as the mistake is essential, for the mistaken party to be allowed to rescind the contract, it is sufficient that the other party caused the mistake. From an efficiency perspective, however, causation is not enough to allow <b>rescission</b> <b>for</b> mistake. Second, the CESL permits rescission when one party failed to disclose information to the other party that would have revealed to the latter his essential mistake and the former party knew or could be expected to have known the mistake. In contrast, under efficiency, not all essential mistakes made by the one party that the other party knew or could have known about constitute grounds <b>for</b> <b>rescission.</b> Third, the CESL allows <b>rescission</b> <b>for</b> fraud, which includes non-disclosure of information. The CESL provides a list of considerations that should be taken into account in deciding whether a duty of disclosure arises. In contrast, under efficiency, there are far more concrete guidelines for determining whether a duty of disclosure arises, and in fact, under certain conditions, intentional (2 ̆ 2 fraudulent 2 ̆ 2) misrepresentations are even permitted. Fourth, the CESL allows a contract to be rescinded when both parties made the same essential mistake. Yet efficiency considerations entail that this should not always be the case and that some mutual mistakes should not be grounds <b>for</b> <b>rescission...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court of Nevada {{held that}} the {{doctrine}} of mutual mistake is not grounds <b>for</b> <b>rescission</b> of a contract when the party bears the risk of mistake.

5000|$|Justice White, {{writing for}} the majority, {{disagreed}} with the DC Circuit and held that the scope of judicial review is the same <b>for</b> <b>rescission</b> {{as it is for}} enacting regulations in the first place. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the view that it should treat rescission the same as a refusal to regulate in the first place: [...] "The Motor Vehicle Safety Act expressly equates orders 'revoking' and 'establishing' safety standards; neither that Act nor the APA suggests that revocations are to be treated as refusals to promulgate standards." ...|$|R
