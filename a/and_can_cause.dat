5|$|Aphasia is {{the result}} of damage to the brain's {{language}} centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> severe, chronic language impairment. Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.|$|E
5|$|Entropion is the inward rolling {{of the eye}}lid, {{commonly}} {{the lower}} lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E

5|$|In {{compound}} implants (two stage implants), {{between the}} actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to {{small amount of}} air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{tropical}} upper tropospheric trough in the Southern Hemisphere lies {{over the}} trade wind {{region of the}} east central Pacific <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> tropical cyclogenesis offshore Central America. In the western Pacific, tropical upper tropospheric lows are the main cause for the few tropical cyclones which develop north of the 20th parallel north and east of the 160th meridian east during La Niña events.|$|E

5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E

5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
50|$|Phototoxins are toxins that <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{allergic}} reactions in particularly susceptible individuals <b>and</b> which <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> dangerous photosensitivity {{in a much}} broader range of subjects.|$|R
25|$|Psycho-social {{factors such}} as stress, abuse, poor social or {{familial}} situations, <b>and</b> poverty <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> anger problems.|$|R
50|$|Some HPV types, such as HPV-5, may {{establish}} {{infections that}} persist for {{the lifetime of}} the individual without ever manifesting any clinical symptoms. HPV types 1 <b>and</b> 2 <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> common warts in some infected individuals. HPV types 6 <b>and</b> 11 <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> genital warts <b>and</b> laryngeal papillomatosis.HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82 are considered carcinogenic.|$|R
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{significant damage}} to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior {{is the main}} ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight {{and are therefore}} recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
50|$|Mutations {{of several}} other Z-disk related proteins, such as desmin, alfa-B-crystallin <b>and</b> myotilin <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{disorders}} similar to zaspopathy.|$|R
