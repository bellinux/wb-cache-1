500|$|It {{is truly}} a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the skipper's tenacity. [...] More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at any time, and do what ever was required. [...] It's a good sea story about doing {{what had to be}} done. [...] On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to re-read about one of the {{forerunners}} of all we're done since.|$|E
500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it." ...|$|E
500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 August 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC had commissioned the six-part comedy Heading Out, which was created and written by Perkins. The BBC's Executive editor of Comedy Commissioning, Kristian Smith, called the show [...] "a warm, intelligent and brilliantly funny sitcom." [...] While Perkins stated that Heading Out [...] "might well be the thing that I'm most proud of. It's been a joy to work on, and I hope that joy proves to be infectious." [...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. She knew that she wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so she could come out to them. The comedian revealed that she is a fan of thrillers and wanted to have a ticking clock element to the show, so she thought Sara's coming out would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|All {{agreed that}} this would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and after {{dividing}} what remained of the food brought along, and getting a drink at a spring, they selected a tree that suited their purpose and mounted to the thickest of the limbs.|$|E
6000|$|Thomas Rooper {{took his}} pipe {{from his mouth}} and sat up straight. Gazing steadfastly at his companion, he remarked, [...] "If {{you think that is}} such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> why don't you do it yourself? There can't be anybody much harder up than you are." ...|$|E

"Now, Ben, I think you'd better learn a hymn; I {{always used}} to when I was a little chap, and it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Sundays," [...] began the new teacher, with a patronizing air, which ruffled his pupil {{as much as the}} opprobrious term [...] "little chap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{should never}} say {{anything}} about it," [...] Rupert said. [...] "I should just {{do it because it}} would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and would save the lives of some of our grenadiers, who will, likely enough, lead the assault. Besides, it would be an adventure, like any other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} that," [...] said the Poor Thing; [...] "for in my thought it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what our fathers did, {{and to keep}} what they kept without question. And in my thought one thing {{is as good as}} another in this world; and a shoe of a horse will do." ...|$|E

60|$|Upon {{the whole}} it seemed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Thereupon they quickened their pace, {{avoiding}} high roads, and following obscure paths tending {{more or less}} northward. But there was an unpractical vagueness in their movements throughout the day; {{neither one of them}} seemed to consider any question of effectual escape, disguise, or long concealment. Their every idea was temporary and unforefending, like the plans of two children.|$|E

[...] "That is my case at any rate, and what I want to know now is if I have your support in my suit. Remember, I have {{something}} to offer, Haswell, for instance, a large fortune of which I will settle half--it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in our business,--and a baronetcy {{that will be a}} peerage before long." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{this book}} Merchant {{describes}} three forms of control: control of specific actions, control of results {{and control of}} personnel. When knowledge of which specific actions are desirable is excellent, it is always <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> control specific actions. When the ability to measure results on important performance dimensions is high, it is always <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> control results. When {{it is difficult to}} know which specific actions are desirable and when it is difficult as well to measure the results, the optimal control is the personnel control.|$|R

60|$|The {{first thing}} she thought of {{when she opened her}} eyes in the morning was poor Miss Barbara in the next room, and that dreadful bill; and then, like a flash of lightning, she thought of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for the Thorpedykes. The project which now laid itself out, detail after detail, before her seemed so simple, so sensible, so {{absolutely}} wise and desirable in every way, that she got up, dressed herself with great rapidity, and went in to see Mrs. Cliff.|$|E

I used sometimes to think that that might be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> though I changed my mind very often about it, but I do not think so, now, at all. Dora is an awfully nice girl in ever so many ways, but since I have been at Barport with her, I am positive that I do not want you to marry her." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening we}} took a walk along the sea-wall. It was a {{beautiful}} starlight night, and {{a great many people}} were walking about. When we got down near the fort,--which looked bigger and grayer than ever by the starlight,--Rectus {{said he would like to}} get inside of it by night, and I agreed that it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> So we went over the drawbridge (this place has a drawbridge, and portcullises, and barbicans, and demi-lunes, and a moat, just as if it were a castle or a fort of some old country in Europe),--but the big gate was shut. We didn't care to knock, for all was dark, and we came away. Rectus proposed that we should reconnoitre the place, and I agreed, although, in reality, there wasn't anything to reconnoitre. We went down into the moat, which was perfectly dry, and very wide, and walked all around the fort.|$|E

6000|$|The cloud sat very black upon Mountjoy Scarborough's {{face as he}} said this, and the blacker it sat {{the more}} Mr. Grey liked him. If {{something}} {{could be done to}} redeem from ruin a young man who so felt about his mother,--who so felt about his mother simply because she had been his mother,--it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Augustus had entertained no such feeling. He had said to Mr. Grey, as he had said also to his brother, that [...] "he had not known the lady." [...] When the facts as to the distribution of the property had been made known to him he had cared nothing for the injury done by the story to his mother's name. The story was too true. Mr. Grey knew that it was true; but he could not on that account do other than feel an intense desire to confer some benefit on Mountjoy Scarborough. He put his hand out affectionately and laid it on the other man's knee. [...] "Your father has not long to live, Captain Scarborough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marcia Raynor," [...] I said--"for I {{shall not}} call you by that title which {{you put on}} and take off as you please--I here declare to you that I shall never give up Sylvia.

I make no answer to what you have charged me with, but I {{say to you that}} as Sylvia's life and my life cannot be one as I would have it, I shall live the life that she lives, even though our lives be ever apart.

6000|$|You {{misunderstood}} me in one point: I always {{hoped to}} found such a society; {{that was the}} outside of my dream, and would mean entire success. BUT - I cannot play Peter the Hermit. In these days of the Fleet Street journalist, I cannot send out better men than myself, with wives or mothers {{just as good as}} mine, and sisters (I may at least say) better, to a danger and a long-drawn dreariness that I do not share. My wife says it's cowardice; what brave men are the leader-writers! Call it cowardice; it is mine. Mind you, I may end by trying to do it by the pen only: I shall not love myself if I do; and is it ever <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a thing for which you despise yourself? - even in the doing? And if the thing you do is to call upon others to do the thing you neglect? I have never dared to say what I feel about men's lives, because my own was in the wrong: shall I dare to send them to death? The physician must heal himself; he must honestly TRY the path he recommends: if he does not even try, should he not be silent? ...|$|E
