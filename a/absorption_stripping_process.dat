The membrane structure was examined in terms of gas permeation, critical water entry pressure, overall porosity, contact angle and mass transfer resistance. The morphology of membrane was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) instrument. The CO 2 absorption and desorption performance of both surface modified membranes were investigated in a hollow fiber membrane contactor system and compared against the unmodified membranes. Pore size, overall porosity and contact angle of fabricated membranes increased significantly by surface modification. Surface modified PVDF and PSf membranes showed higher CO 2 <b>absorption</b> and <b>stripping</b> flux compared to plain PVDF and PSf membranes. Results of long-term study demonstrated that after an initial CO 2 flux reduction the surface modified membranes performance maintained constant over 130 h operation. By increasing SMM concentration in spinning dope to 6 wt. %, CO 2 <b>absorption</b> and <b>stripping</b> flux increased. However, by increasing SMM concentration to 8 wt. % both CO 2 <b>absorption</b> and <b>stripping</b> flux decreased, considerably. Thus, {{it can be concluded}} that for surface modification of PVDF and PSf hollow fiber membrane contactor 6 wt. % of SMM as additive is an optimum concentration. From CO 2 stripping experiments it was found that liquid absorbent temperature played an important role on CO 2 stripping flux but gas flow rate had no significant effect.

The flare was observed with the 1. 6 meter aperture New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. For this unique data set, sunspot dynamics during flaring were analyzed {{for the first}} time. By directly imaging the upper chromosphere, running penumbral waves are clearly seen as an outward extension of umbral flashes, both {{take the form of}} absorption in the 10830 Å narrow-band images. From a space-time image made of a slit cutting across a flare ribbon and the sunspot, we find that the dark lanes for umbral flashes and penumbral waves are obviously broadened after the flare. The most prominent feature is the sudden appearance of an oscillating <b>absorption</b> <b>strip</b> inside the ribbon when it sweeps into the sunspot's penumbral and umbral regions. During each oscillation, outwardly propagating umbral flashes and subsequent penumbral waves rush out into the inwardly sweeping ribbon, followed by a returning of the <b>absorption</b> <b>strip</b> with similar speed. We tentatively explain the phenomena {{as the result of a}} sudden increase in the density of ortho-Helium atoms in the area of the sunspot being excited by the flare's EUV illumination. This explanation is based on the observation that 10830 Å absorption around the sunspot area gets enhanced during the flare. Nevertheless, questions are still open and we need further well-devised observations to investigate the behavior of sunspot dynamics during flares. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
