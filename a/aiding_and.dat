They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the uprising, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and African National Congress (ANC), and of <b>aiding</b> <b>and</b> abetting the students' revolt.|$|E

The APA contends that equitable access to more appropriate equipment will {{improve the quality of}} life of people with disabilities and improve their capacity to participate in community living. The provision of <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> equipment is essential for many people with disabilities and is complementary to the provision of quality physiotherapy services. Physiotherapists have a key role in prescribing <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> equipment and assisting people with disabilities to access appropriate equipment.

Description of <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> equipment <b>Aids</b> <b>and</b> equipment are products that assist a person with a disability by improving their functioning (AIHW 2003). <b>Aids</b> <b>and</b> equipment include specialised aids for breathing, eating, drinking, bathing, toileting, mobility, positioning (lying, seating, standing) and sleeping; home modifications, hoists, augmentative communication devices and environment control units. <b>Aids</b> <b>and</b> equipment can provide comfort, pain relief, safety, and support and can assist in the pursuit of education, training...|$|R
5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for <b>aiding</b> <b>and</b> abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on 20 July 1931 before Mr Justice Wright, with Sir William Jowitt, D.N. Pritt and Eustace Fulton for the prosecution, Sir John Simon, J.E.

On count 1 Kylsant was charged with issuing a document, namely the annual report for 1926 with intent to deceive the shareholders about the true state of the company, Morland was charged with <b>aiding</b> <b>and</b> abetting this offence. Count 2 was an identical count relating to the annual report for 1927 against both defendants and on count 3 Kylsant alone was charged with issuing a document—the debenture stock prospectus of 1928 with intent to induce people to advance property to the company. All counts were contrary to section 84 of the Larceny Act 1861. Both defendants {{pleaded not guilty to}} all counts.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial was}} held at the Assizes in the small rural market town of Buckingham. More used to the trials of local poachers and sheep thieves, Buckingham had never before seen such a spectacle. The town was {{inundated}} with journalists and the merely curious. Byrne was charged with manslaughter. Tom Cribb, Reuben Martin, Thomas Reynolds, and George Cooper were charged with <b>aiding</b> <b>and</b> abetting manslaughter. With such illustrious names as Cribb's, Jackson's and Spring's involved, the trial had the potential to turn into a huge establishment scandal. People of all classes had bet hundreds of pounds on the outcome of the boxing match. Despite being banned, prize fighting enjoyed huge public support and patronage from levels up to the younger male members of the Royal family, some of whom Jackson had taught to box. The support received by Byrne at his trial is testimony to the wealth of his backers. The establishment rallied to his support; Byrne was represented by three barristers and five solicitors, and twelve witnesses journeyed from London to give evidence on his behalf.|$|E

This paper empirically assesses the contribution of FDI <b>and</b> <b>aid</b> to economic growth in a panel of 139 developing countries over 23 years (1990 - 2012). This study makes a distinction between foreign <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> foreign infrastructure <b>aid.</b> The latter is foreign aid, which is purely targeted at infrastructural developments of a country.

This study finds some result to support a significant positive relationship between foreign <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> FDI. A second result is that the positive effect of aid seems to be stronger when using the infrastructure aid variable. We could not verify that more aid combined with more FDI lead to a higher growth. The above findings are important, particularly in light of th...|$|R
