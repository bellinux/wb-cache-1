60|$|Of {{the nature}} of our task I must {{continue}} to give some summary idea. The forecastle was lumbered with ship's chandlery, the hold nigh full of rice, the lazarette crowded with the teas and silks. These must all be dug out; and that made but a fraction of our task. The hold was ceiled throughout; a part, where perhaps some delicate cargo was once stored, had been lined, in addition, with inch boards; and between every beam there was <b>a</b> <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> into the bilge. Any of these, the bulkheads of the cabins, the very timbers of the hull itself, might be the place of hiding. It was therefore necessary to demolish, as we proceeded, a great part of the ship's inner skin and fittings, and to auscultate what remained, like a doctor sounding for a lung disease. Upon the return, from any beam or bulkhead, of a doubtful sound, we must up axe and hew into the timber: a violent and--from the amount of dry rot in the wreck--a mortifying exercise. Every night saw a deeper inroad into the bones of the Flying Scud--more beams tapped and hewn in splinters, more planking peeled away and tossed aside--and every night saw us as far as ever from the end and object of our arduous devastation. In this perpetual disappointment, my courage did not fail me, but my spirits dwindled; and Nares himself grew silent and morose. At night, when supper was done, we passed an hour in the cabin, mostly without speech: I, sometimes dozing over a book; Nares, sullenly but busily drilling sea-shells with the instrument called a Yankee fiddle. A stranger might have supposed we were estranged; as a matter of fact, in this silent comradeship of labour, our intimacy grew.|$|E

50|$|The STP-Paxton Turbocar {{was built}} around an {{aluminum}} box-shaped backbone. The driver was {{seated on the}} right side of the backbone, while the engine, a Pratt & Whitney Canada ST6B-62 turbine engine, was mounted on the left side of the backbone. Though never successful as an automobile powerplant, the small aircraft engine it was based on would become one of the most popular turboprop aircraft engines in history. The engine drove a Ferguson 4-wheel drive system, which transmitted the power to the wheels. A torque converter eliminated the need for a clutch pedal and gearshift. The engine idled at 54% of full throttle, which meant that the driver didn't even have to press the accelerator pedal to pull away; all he had to do was ease his foot off the brake pedal. <b>A</b> <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> was mounted behind the cockpit, which acted as an airbrake.

40|$|Personalized {{ventilation}} {{has great}} potential to improve inhaled air quality and to accommodate individual thermal preferences. In order to quantify these perceived benefits, a numerical method has been developed. In this method, a numerical thermal manikin (NTM), {{with the real}} geometry of a human body, is obtained by employing a laser scanning technique. When placed in a virtual environment, the thermal interactions with the environment are calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By iteration, the calculated air velocity near the body surface is fed into a sophisticated thermoregulation model developed at the University of California, Berkeley, so that the local thermal comfort in a non-uniform environment created by personalized air (PA) is rigorously investigated. In this paper, the performances of three different PV systems are investigated, namely, the desk-edge-based PV, PV using <b>a</b> <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> (MP), and chair-based PV. The results exhibit reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements. The three types of PV are all able to lower human exposure to ambient room pollutants and bring a “cool head” thermal condition favorable for thermal comfort. The present work illustrates that {{in the development of}} localized personal environmental control systems, an NTM coupled with a human-body thermal regulation model is a useful tool for visualizing thermal comfort and ventilation effectiveness.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} novel hybrid signal {{processing}} technique to extract information on disbond-type defects {{from a single}} B-scan {{in the process of}} non-destructive testing (NDT) of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) material using ultrasonic guided waves (GW). The selected GFRP sample has been a segment of wind turbine blade, which possessed an aerodynamic shape. Two disbond type defects having diameters of 15 mm and 25 mm were artificially constructed on its trailing edge. The experiment has been performed using the low-frequency ultrasonic system developed at the Ultrasound Institute of Kaunas University of Technology and only one side of the sample was accessed. A special configuration of the transmitting and receiving transducers fixed on <b>a</b> <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> with a separation distance of 50 mm was proposed for recording the ultrasonic guided wave signals at each one-millimeter step along the scanning distance up to 500 mm. Finally, the hybrid signal processing technique comprising the valuable features of the three most promising signal processing techniques: cross-correlation, wavelet transform, and Hilbert–Huang transform has been applied to the received signals for the extraction of defects information from a single B-scan image. The wavelet transform and cross-correlation techniques have been combined in order to extract the approximated size and location of the defects and measurements of time delays. Thereafter, Hilbert–Huang transform has been applied to the wavelet transformed signal to compare the variation of instantaneous frequencies and instantaneous amplitudes of the defect-free and defective signals...|$|E
40|$|We {{have created}} a visual 3 D anthropometric {{landmark}} glossary usable over the Web. Implemented using VRML, the Virtual Reality Modeling Language, users may easily locate and determine the names of these landmarks. Landmarks are visualized as small spheres located over the body.

The landmarks also highlight when selected, giving visual feedback. In addition a number of reference planes, such as the Frankfort plane and the coronal, sagittal and transverse planes can be turned on or off. Additional display controls are available via <b>a</b> <b>movable</b> control <b>panel.</b> The initial set of landmark names comes from the CAESAR (Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource) project.

40|$|Gain {{calibration}} for X-ray imaging {{systems with}} <b>a</b> <b>movable</b> flat <b>panel</b> detector and an intrinsic crosshair {{is a challenge}} due to the geometry-dependent heel effect and crosshair artifact. This study aims to develop a gain correction method for such system by implementing the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction technique. Flood field images containing crosshair and heel effect were acquired in 4 different flat panel detector positions at fixed exposure parameters. The crosshair region was automatically detected using common image processing algorithms and removed by a simple interpolation procedure, resulting in a crosshair-removed image. A large kernel-based correction was then used to remove the heel effect. Mask filters corresponding to each crosshair region were applied to the resultant heel effect-removed images to invalidate the pixels of the original crosshair region. Finally, a seamless gain map was composed with corresponding valid pixels from the processed images either by the sequential replacement or by the selective averaging techniques developed in this study. Quantitative evaluation was performed based on normalized noise power spectrum and detective quantum efficiency improvement factor for the flood field images corrected by the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction-based gain maps. For comparison purpose, a single crosshair-removed gain map was also tested. As a result, it was demonstrated that the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction technique achieved better image quality than the crosshair-removed technique, showing lower normalized noise power spectrum values over most of spatial frequencies. The improvement was more obvious at the priori-crosshair region of the gain map. The mean detective quantum efficienc...|$|R
