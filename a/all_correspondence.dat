5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> with the government should be in Dutch.|$|E

Novak and Evans claimed this was part of an organized campaign to put pressure on Pinochet's government closely coordinated by the Cuban and Soviet governments, using individuals like Letelier to implement these efforts.

500|$|Two {{years after}} Sam Houston's death, Baylor University {{president}} William Carey Crane {{was commissioned by}} Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had {{little more than a}} passing acquaintance with [...] "the hero of San Jacinto". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's [...] "guardian angel", as he called her, had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L. Haley, [...] "...Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret, that he had no more war to fight within himself, left him with more energy to wage political battle." [...] Ultimately, several of Houston's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor, but not everyone was inspired to join the effort. According to daughter Maggie, the author had told her that many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest. Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas was rejected by the initial publisher, but was eventually published by J. B. Lippincott in 1884.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{temporary}} {{lull in the}} Jay Treaty furor after Washington signed it on August 24. The following year, however, it flared up again, when the House of Representatives inserted itself into the debate. This time the fight was not only over {{the merits of the}} treaty, but also about whether the House had the power under the Constitution to refuse to appropriate the money necessary for a treaty already ratified by the Senate and signed by the president. Citing its constitutional fiscal authority (Article I, Section 7), the House requested that the president turn over all documents that related to the treaty, including his instructions to Jay, <b>all</b> <b>correspondence,</b> and all other documents relating to the treaty negotiations. He refused to do so, invoking what later became known as executive privilege, and insisted that the House did not have the Constitutional authority to block treaties. A contentious debate ensued, during which, Washington's most vehement opponents in the House {{went so far as to}} publicly call for his impeachment. Through it all, Washington responded to his critics by using his prestige, political skills, and the power of office in a sincere and straightforward fashion to broaden public support for his stance. On April 30, the House voted 51–48 to approve the requisite treaty funding. Jeffersonians carried their campaign against the treaty and [...] "pro-British Federalist policies" [...] into the political campaigns (both state and federal) of 1796, where the political divisions marking the First Party System became crystallized.|$|E

[...] Following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps, he was elected chief of the Parry Island Band from February 1921. [...] Once in office he caused a schism in the band after he wrote a letter calling for certain individuals and those of mixed race to be expelled from the reserve. [...] He was re-elected in 1924 and served until he was deposed via an internal power struggle in April 1925. [...] Before the motion could go through, Pegahmagabow resigned. [...] A decade later, he was appointed councillor from 1933 to 1936. [...] In 1933 the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) changed its policies and forbade First Nation chiefs from corresponding with the DIA. [...] They directed that <b>all</b> <b>correspondence,</b> as of the spring of 1933, go through the Indian Agent. [...] This gave huge power to the Agent, something that grated on Pegahmagabow, who did not get along with his Indian Agent, John Daly. [...] First Nation members who served in the army during World War I were particularly active as political activists. [...] They had travelled the world, earned the respect of the comrades in the trenches, and refused to be sidelined by the newly empowered Indian Agent. [...] Historian Paul Williams termed these advocates [...] "returned soldier chiefs", and singled out a few, including Pegahmagabow, as being especially active. [...] This caused intense disagreements with Daly and eventually led to Pegahmagabow being deposed as chief. [...] Daly and other agents who came in contact with Pegahmagabow were incredibly frustrated by his attempts, in his words, to free his people from [...] "white slavery". [...] The Indian agents labelled him a [...] "mental case" [...] and strove to sideline him and his supporters.|$|E
