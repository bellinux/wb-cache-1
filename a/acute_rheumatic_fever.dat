The incidental finding of Aschoff bodies in myocardial biopsies is frequently reported in the nineteenth-century literature, with prevalences as high as 35 %, but no clinical or prognostic data on the patients is included.

Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with <b>acute</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E

40|$|T H E {{abdominal}} {{manifestations of}} <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> {{have been known}} since Andral, in 1839, {{called attention to the}} presence of abdominal pain in cases showing other evidences of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever.</b> The French, who were the first to study this problem, found signs and symptoms of peritoneal irritation in <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever,</b> manifested chiefly by attacks of abdominal pain at the onset of rheumatic activity, and found that when the arthritic pains began the abdominal pains stopped and vice versa. This important association of abdominal pain and <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> has largely escaped the attention of the internist and the surgeon. Poynton, 1 in 1925, was the first to describe a chronic peritonitis in a fatal case of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> with most of the exudate around the liver and spleen.

2500|$|Additional {{complications}} may {{be caused}} by GAS, namely <b>acute</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> and acute glomerulonephritis. Rheumatic fever, a disease that affects the joints, kidneys, and heart valves, is a consequence of untreated strep A infection caused not by the bacterium itself. Rheumatic fever is caused by the antibodies created by the immune system to fight off the infection cross-reacting with other proteins in the body. This [...] "cross-reaction" [...] causes the body to essentially attack itself and leads to the damage above. A similar autoimmune mechanism initiated by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection is hypothesized to cause pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), wherein autoimmune antibodies affect the basal ganglia, causing rapid onset of psychiatric, motor, sleep, and other symptoms in pediatric patients.|$|E
40|$|In the guinea pig, chronic scurvy with {{superimposed}} infection (beta streptococcus) and to {{a lesser}} extent chronic scurvy alone, produces an arthropathy with striking pathologic similarities to that of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> and the closely allied condition of rheumatoid arthritis. Considerable significance is attached to the widespread occurrence in the experimental animal subjected to scurvy and infection, {{and to a}} lesser extent in scurvy alone, of lesions similar to if not identical with the fibrinoid degeneration which has been considered the fundamental lesion of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever.</b> A subcutaneous nodule essentially similar to the subcutaneous nodules of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> was observed in one experimental animal. Attention is called to a group of general pathologic changes frequently observed in <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> which were also found in the experimental animals subjected to scurvy and infection. These include degenerative changes in skeletal muscle, focal necrosis in the liver, fibrosis of the Malpighian bodies in the spleen, erythrophagocytosis in the lymph nodes, and focal lymphocytic accumulations in the kidneys. The problem of hemorrhage is considered. It is suggested that a scorbutic state may be the basis of the hemorrhagic manifestations common to the <b>acute</b> phases of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever.</b> The unsatisfactory nature of previous experimental attempts to reproduce the pathology of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> is noted. The lesions produced by subjecting the guinea pig to the combined influence of scurvy and infection are considered to be fundamentally similar in character and distribution to those of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever.</b> The pathologic observations recorded in this and a previous publication (2) are believed to offer evidence that the disease known as <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> may be the result of the combined influence of scurvy and infection. It is suggested that a subclinical degree of scurvy may constitute the rheumatic tendency in which the added factor of infection causes the development of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> or possibly the closely allied condition of rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) {{causes a}} variety of diseases, {{including}} <b>acute</b> pharyngitis, impetigo, <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> and the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Moreover, S. pyogenes {{was responsible for the}} classical example of a nosocomial infection, the epidemics of puerperal fever (childbed fever) that caused the death of numerous women in earlier centuries. The most extensively studied virulence factor of S. pyogenes is the surface M protein, which inhibits phagocytosis and shows antigenic variation. Recent data indicate that many M proteins confer phagocytosis resistance because the variable N-terminal region has non-overlapping sites that specifically bind two components of the human immune system, the complement inhibitor C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) and IgA-Fc. Concerning puerperal fever, molecular and epidemiological analysis suggests that the S. pyogenes surface protein R 28 may have played a pathogenetic role in these epidemics. This article summarizes the properties of M protein and the R 28 protein and considers a potential problem encountered in connection with the use of animal models for vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{antigenic}} mimicry in autoimmune {{diseases such as}} <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever</b> has been under investigation for decades {{and the range of}} cross-reactive tissue antigens for streptococcal-induced antibodies identified in rheumatic heart disease is still expanding. To identify heart tissue-reactive antigens which may be implicated in the secondary immunopathogenesis of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever,</b> sera from 56 patients with <b>acute</b> <b>rheumatic</b> heart disease were probed in two-dimensional Western blots for reactivity against heart tissue antigens. After two-dimensional immunoblot analysis, proteins were submitted to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. This analysis identified creatine kinase, two mitochondrial proteins and, at a low level, various stress proteins as cross-reactive myocardial antigens. Therefore, in addition to myosin, creatine kinase may represent another major antigen for autoreactive antibodies in rheumatic heart disease.

The {{aim of this}} study is to determine relationship between hs-CRP and MV restenosis 48 - 36 months after performing PTMC. Methods: A total of 50 patients who had undergone PTMC due to rheumatic etiology (41 female, 9 male; mean age 46 ± 11, range 27 - 71), all followed up on an out patients basis 36 months after PTMC, were included in the study. The hs-CRP was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: No association was found between hs-CRP level and mean transmitral valve gradient 36 months after PTMC, MV area by planimetry, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, mitral regurgitation grade, left atrial diameter, atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm and Wilkins score. Conclusion: Our study have shown that there is no association between hs-CRP and MV restenosis in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) who underwent PTMC. Therefore, it has been postulated that inflammation is not a cause of post PTMC restenosis...|$|R

This surprisingly high rate of group G colonization (14. 3 %) led to a retrospective study of school surveys in 1967 which showed that the colonization rate with this organism was 2. 3 % (range 1. 3 - 3. 5 %). A review of bacitracin-sensitive streptococcal isolates from hospital admissions of patients with <b>acute</b> glomerulonephritis (AGN), <b>rheumatic</b> <b>fever,</b> and their siblings, between January 1967 and July 1980, was conducted.

The other 11 group G isolates were from rheumatic-fever patients and their siblings. Thus, the group G colonization rate fluctuates in the population.
