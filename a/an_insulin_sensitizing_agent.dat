40|$|Women with polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{are increasingly}} being treated with metformin as <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> to reduce symptoms of hyperandrogenism and promote fertility. Indications such as hirsutism and cycle regulation require long term treatment. The drug is also being used through pregnancy.

We describe the failure of recruitment to a study undertaken to explore the effects of metformin treatment discontinuation in women with PCOS, to provide both clinical and aetiological information. The study failed because the patients did not wish to stop treatment, and it illustrates the problems facing doctors working in this area. To achieve a safer prescribing environment, we recommend that action be taken by the manufacturer of metformin to work with regulatory agencies on a European base to extend prescribing indications for metformin to women with PCOS...|$|E
40|$|Abnormalities of glucose regulation, {{including}} impaired glucose {{tolerance and}} insulin resistance, are often seen among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) –infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Insulin resistance in this population may result from antiviral medication directly impairing glucose uptake in the muscle, effects of HIV per se, or indirect effects, such as fat redistribution. Insulin resistance may {{increase the risk of}} coronary heart disease among this population of patients, in part by inhibiting normal thrombolysis. The optimal treatment for insulin resistance and impaired glucose intolerance in HIV-infected patients is not known, but preliminary studies have suggested that metformin, <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> improves insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and waist circumference. Initial studies of thiazolidinediones also suggest the potential utility of such agents to improve insulin sensitivity, decrease hepatic steatosis, and increase subcutaneous fat.

This open label pilot study evaluated this potential utility of bromocriptine-QR. Methods. Ten T 2 DM subjects on metformin (1 - 2 [*]gm/day) and high-dose (TDID ≥ 65 [*]U/day) basal-bolus insulin were enrolled to receive once daily (morning) bromocriptine-QR (1. 6 – 4. 8 [*]mg/day) for 24 weeks. Subjects {{with at least one}} postbaseline HbA 1 c measurement (N= 8) were analyzed for change from baseline HbA 1 c, TDID, and postprandial glucose area under the curve of a four-hour mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Results. Compared to the baseline, average HbA 1 c decreased 1. 76 % (9. 74 ± 0. 56 to 7. 98 ± 0. 36, P= 0. 01), average TDID decreased 27 % (199 ± 33 to 147 ± 31, P= 0. 009), and MMTT AUC 60 – 240 decreased 32 % (P= 0. 04) over the treatment period. The decline in HbA 1 c and TDID was observed at 8 weeks and sustained over the remaining 16 -week study duration. Conclusion.

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} a major {{worldwide}} health problem. Intervention programs to ameliorate the rate of obesity have been designed and implemented; yet the epidemic has no end near in sight.

40|$|Abstract In 2000, {{more than}} 151 {{million people in}} the world are diabetic. It is {{predicted}} that by 2010, 221 million people and by 2025, 324 million will be diabetic. In the U. S., for the population born in 2000, the estimated lifetime risk for diabetes is more than 1 in 3. The economic and human cost of this disease is devastating. The current cost of diabetes in the U. S. is estimated to be at $ 132 billion, which includes $ 92 billion of direct medical costs and $ 40 billion of indirect costs such as disability, work loss and premature mortality. The outbreak of the current diabetic epidemic has been accompanied by a similarly drastic increase in obesity. The relation between the two is a matter of debate but presumably both are caused by changes in dietary habits and an increasingly sedentary modern lifestyle. Compelling scientific evidence indicates that lifestyle modification effectively prevents or delays the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. Recent clinical trials also demonstrate that success in the treatment of obesity, either surgically or pharmacologically, leads to the prevention of type 2 diabetes among the obese. Clinical data have also revealed that the <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> troglitazone is efficacious in both β-cell preservation and delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.

40|$|Troglitazone, <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> has {{a direct}} {{positive}} inotropic effect. However, the mechanism of this effect remains unclear. Thus, we examined the inotropic effect of troglitazone while focusing on intracellular Ca 2 + handling. Troglitazone significantly increased peak isovolumic left ventricular pressure (LVPmax), peak rate of rise of LVP (dP/dtmax), peak rate of fall of LVP (dP/dtmin) in isolated rat hearts perfused at a constant coronary flow and heart rate. This inotropic effect of troglitazone was not inhibited by pretreatment with carbachol (muscarine receptor agonist), H 89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), U 73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor), H 7 (protein kinase C inhibitor), verapamil (L-type Ca 2 + channel antagonist), thapsigargin (Ca 2 +-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor) or ryanodine (ryanodine receptor opener). Radioimmunoassay showed that the cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration in the left ventricle was not increased by troglitazone. Whole-cell patch clamp analysis revealed that troglitazone {{had no effect on}} inward Ca 2 + currents in cardiomyocytes. In fura- 2 loaded perfused rat hearts, troglitazone exerted its positive inotropic effect without increasing Ca 2 + concentration. These results suggest that neither the inward Ca 2 + currents nor Ca 2 + handling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was involved in the inotropic effect of troglitazone. Furthermore, troglitazone exerted its positive inotropic effect without affecting the intracellular concentration of Ca 2 +. In conclusion, the positive inotropic effect of troglitazone is mediated by a sensitization of Ca 2 +...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rosiglitazone, <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} {{implicated in the}} control of inflammatory processes and modulation of expression of various cytokines such as tumor ne-crosis factor (TNF-α). However, its mechanistic effect of gastric mucosal integrity remains to be elucidated. Methods: The present {{study was designed to}} determine effect of rosiglitazone on gastric mucosal lesions induced by indomethacin (IND) in rats. Pyloric ligation was performed for the collection of gastric juice, and gastric ulceration was induced by a single intra-peritoneal injection of IND (30 mg/kg). Results: IND administration caused a significant decrease in the volume of gastric juice mucin and gastric mucosal nitrite and pros-taglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels. This was accompanied by a significant increase in gastric juice free and total acidity and pepsin activity. In addition, an elevation in the gastric mucosal lipid peroxide and serum TNF-α level was observed. Pretreatment with rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg, orally, for 1 weeks) resulted in a significant reduction in the elevated gastric mucosal lesions and lipid peroxides levels. This was associated with a marked increase in gastric juice mucin and a reduction in TNF-α level. Moreover, rosiglitazone significantly increased the gastric mucosal total nitrite and PGE 2 levels. Conclusions: Rosiglitazone exerts a gastroprotective effect against IND-induced gastric mucosal lesions and its anti-ulcer effect is mediated via scavenging free radicals, increasing NO, PGE 2 and mucus production in addition to its anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Thus, rosiglitazone could be a relevant drug for patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and at high risk of de-veloping gastric ulceration...|$|E

Main methods 16 week-old MSG rats were treated with metformin for 15 days and compared with age-matched untreated MSG and non-obese non-diabetic rats (control). Blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, vascular reactivity and prostanoid release in the perfused mesenteric arteriolar bed as well as nitric oxide production and reactive oxygen species generation in isolated mesenteric arteries were analyzed. Key findings 18 -week-old MSG rats displayed higher Lee index, fat accumulation, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Metformin treatment improved these alterations. The norepinephrine-induced response, increased in the mesenteric arteriolar bed from MSG rats, was corrected by metformin. Indomethacin corrected the enhanced contractile response in MSG rats but did not affect metformin effects. The sensitivity to acetylcholine, reduced in MSG rats, was also corrected by metformin. Indomethacin corrected the reduced sensitivity to acetylcholine in MSG rats but did not affect metformin effects.

Methods A prospective case based therapeutic comparison between insulin, sulfonylurea, metformin and thiazolidinedione was observed over one decade with 20 CFRD patients diagnosed using American Diabetes Association guideline standards. Patients entering the study elected treatment based on risk and benefit information provided for treatment options. Patients receiving organ transplant or requiring combination diabetic medications were excluded from the study.

40|$|Impaired glucose {{tolerance}} (IGT) {{is associated}} with defects in both insulin secretion and action and carries a high risk for conversion to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Troglitazone, <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> reduces glucose concentrations in subjects with NIDDM and IGT but is not known to affect insulin secretion. We sought to determine the role of beta cell function in mediating improved glucose tolerance. Obese subjects with IGT received 12 wk of either 400 mg daily of troglitazone (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) in a randomized, double-blind design. Study measures at baseline and after treatment were glucose and insulin responses to a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test, insulin sensitivity index (SI) assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion rates during a graded glucose infusion, and beta cell glucose-sensing ability during an oscillatory glucose infusion. Troglitazone reduced integrated glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose by 10 % (P = 0. 03) and 39 % (P = 0. 003), respectively. SI increased from 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 to 2. 6 +/- 0. 4 x 10 (-) 5 min- 1 pM- 1 (P = 0. 005).

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{results from a}} combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids on insulin resistant cell lines, viz skeletal muscle (C 2 C 12) and fat (3 T 3 -L 1), and to investigate the effects of these cannabinoids on insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells (INS 1). Insulin resistance was induced in the cells using 20 ng/mL TNF-α (3 T 3 -L 1) and 100 nM insulin (C 2 C 12). Insulin resistant cells were exposed to cannabinoids for 48 hours after which glucose uptake, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis was performed. Additionally, adipokine assays were performed on the 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. The insulin resistant 3 T 3 -L 1 and C 2 C 12 cells had reduced glucose uptake, decreased IRS- 1 and Glut- 4 expression indicative of an insulin resistant state. The extract and THC significantly enhanced glucose uptake, IRS- 1 and Glut- 4 in 3 T 3 -L 1 and C 2 C 12 cells. The extract and THC thus have the potential to be <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Interleukin- 6 was significantly decreased by THC.

Curs acadèmic: 2016 - 2017 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{a devastating}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{and the most}} common cause of dementia affecting elderly people. Its pathological hallmarks are the presence of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), also known as senile plaques, and intracellular clusters of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, commonly called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Classically, the brain was considered to be insulin-insensitive, but evidence has proved the contrary and now it is widely accepted that insulin and IGF- 1 have neuromodulatory actions. Insulin signaling is involved in various neuronal functions such as synapse transmission, cognition, learning and memory. Insulin resistance, together with AβOs neurotoxicity, neuronal metabolic stress and neuroinflammation, has been shown to play a role in AD pathogenesis. In this review we will describe the connection between neuronal insulin signaling and the pathogenesis and progression of AD, as well as the new promising therapeutic approaches focused on the insulin signaling pathway that are being researched, such as intranasal <b>insulin</b> or <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

The objectives were to determine the mechanism by which <b>an</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> (2, 4 -thiazolidinedione; TZD) and plane of nutrition (PON) can affect the metabolic health of transition cows. In experiment one, plasma leptin and tumor necrosis factor-[alpha], and adipose tissue peroxisome proliferator activated-[gamma] (PPAR[gamma]) mRNA were increased by prepartum TZD administration. The effects of PON and feed deprivation on insulin responses were measured in experiment two via glucose tolerance test (GTT) and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) techniques. Cows subjected to high and low PON and then subjected to feed deprivation had different responses in glucose and lipid metabolism as measured by both GTT and HEC. The effects of feed deprivation were much greater than PON. Cows deprived of feed had much slower clearance of glucose during GTT, suggesting greater insulin resistance. Following feed deprivation, cows had greatly attenuated insulin response to GTT. In the final experiment, the effects of both PON and TZD were investigated using GTT, insulin challenge (IC), and adipose tissue mRNA analysis. There were differential effects of PON on glucose and fatty acid metabolism such that cows fed a lower PON had smaller glucose but larger NEFA responses following GTT. The only significant interactions of PON and TZD administration were that plasma NEFA responses were most dramatic for cows treated with TZD and fed lower PON. While TZD administration or diet did not affect fatty acid synthase, leptin, TNF[alpha], or adiponectin mRNA expression, the higher energy level diet increased mRNA of PPAR[gamma] and lipoprotein lipase.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the effect of lipid exposure on FA metabolism, glucose transport and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of rodents and lean and obese humans. This thesis also examined whether specific <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> (globular adiponectin (gAd), exercise, ceramide synthesis inhibitor (fumonisin B 1; (FB 1)) could prevent the suspected deleterious effects of palmitate. Finally, this thesis examined whether the lipogenic capacity of muscle of obese humans is different compared to lean. In the first study, 4 hrs of 2 mM palmitate exposure impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle from obese but not lean individuals. The coincubation of 2. 5 µg/mL gAd did not prevent the effect of palmitate. Globular Ad stimulated fatty acid (FA) oxidation in lean and obese humans, suggesting that stimulating FA oxidation is not sufficient to prevent the detrimental effects of palmitate. Skeletal muscle of obese humans is characterized by increased FA transport and TAG accumulation; however {{little is known about the}} role of lipogenesis in lipid accumulation in obesity. In the second study, the skeletal muscle lipogenic capacity, and proteins involved in ceramide metabolism were not different between lean and obes...|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} impact of the gestational diabetes on the maternal and fetal health is well known and this impact {{is closely related to}} gestational age at which the diagnosis is done. Therefore, the use of therapeutic options able to prevent or delay the gestational diabetes occurrence has a positive impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Physical activity and dietary advice represent the first choice and they are the most studied as well. They represent a non-pharmacological option and {{have a positive impact on}} insulin resistance although they do not seem to prevent the gestational diabetes onset. The preconceptional use of metformin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome protects the pancreatic beta cell reserve preventing or delaying the occurrence of gestational diabetes. However, there are also doubts on the drug safety in pregnancy since it completely crosses the placenta. From this point of view, the inositol could represent an excellent alternative. Its role as <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> is well documented on improving both the hormonal and reproductive parameters. However, the studies on its preconceptional use in preventing gestational diabetes are too limited though the first results are extremely encouraging...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} [PCOS] is the commonest {{cause of}} anovulatory infertility. Treatment modes available are numerous mainly relying on ovarian stimulation with FSH, <b>a</b> reduction in <b>insulin</b> concentrations and <b>a</b> decrease in LH levels {{as the basis}} of the therapeutic principles. Clomiphene citrate is still the first line treatment and if unsuccessful is usually followed by direct FSH stimulation. This should be given in a low dose protocol, essential to avoid the otherwise prevalent complications of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies. The addition of a GnRH agonists, while very useful during IVF/ET, adds little to ovulation induction success whereas the position of GnRH antagonists is not yet clear. Hyperinsulinemia is the commonest contributor to the state of anovulation and its reduction, by weight loss or <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> such as metformin, will alone often restore ovulation or will improve results when used in combination with other agents. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is proving equally as successful as FSH for the induction of ovulation, particularly in thin patients with high LH concentrations. Aromatase inhibitors are presently being examined and may replace clomiphene in the future. When all else has failed, IVF/ET produces excellent results. In conclusion, there are very few women suffering from anovulatory infertility associated with PCOS who cannot be successfully treated today. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-alcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) is {{the more}} aggressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH can progress to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and primary liver cancer. Therapy is evolving with {{a substantial number of}} trials of promising new agents now in progress. In this article however, we will examine data for several older forms of therapy which have been fairly extensively studied over the years: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) supplements, vitamin E, <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> with <b>a</b> focus on pioglitazone and statin agents. Early interest in PUFA derived from their potential benefit in cardio-metabolic disease and the close association of NAFLD/NASH with Metabolic Syndrome. Results have been variable although most studies show reduction of liver fat without other major effects and their effects are influenced by concomitant weight loss and underlying genetic factors. Vitamin E has had some efficacy in pediatric NASH but questionable efficacy in even mild NASH among adults. Pioglitazone has shown significant histological benefit in a number of trials but concern over side-effects (especially weight gain) have dampened enthusiasm. <b>A</b> newer <b>insulin</b> sensitizer, liraglutide, has also shown promise in a small randomized, controlled trial. Very limited data exists regarding the histological effects of the statins in NASH and these agents appear to be fairly neutral with neither clear cut benefit nor detriment. Their use is best guided by cardiovascular risks rather than liver histology...|$|R
40|$|Glitazones or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a {{class of}} oral <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents.</b> They act on the nuclear {{receptor}} of the target cells called as Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor- γ (PPAR-γ). They were introduced into clinical practice in 1997. The first agent troglitazone was extensively studied, later withdrawn for association with hepatotoxicity. Second generation TZDs are rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Other {{members of the group}} are ciglitazone and englitazone. These compounds show qualitatively similar metabolic activity but vary in potency. 1 Site and Mechanism of Action (Fig. 1) PPAR γ is a nuclear receptor found predominantly in adipose tissue, also present in skeletal muscle and liver. Natural ligands of PPAR γ include fatty acids (FA), prostaglandin metabolites and leukotrienes. TZDs are synthetic ligands of the intracellular PPAR- γ. TZDs are lipophilic drugs which readily enter cells and bind to PPAR γ with high affinity. PPAR γ is complexed with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and their activation results in activation of regulatory sequences of DNA that control the expression of specific genes. Besides pioglitazone also works through PPAR α at liver for regulation of lipid homeostasis. Fig. 1 : Mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones C h a p t e r 4...|$|R
40|$|The Type 2 {{diabetic}} db/db mouse experiences vascular dysfunction {{typified by}} changes in the contraction and relaxation profiles of small mesenteric arteries (SMAs). Contractions of SMAs from the db/db mouse to the alpha(1) -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) were significantly enhanced, and acetylcholine (ACh) -induced relaxations were significantly depressed. Drug treatment of db/db mice with a nonthiazolidinedione peroxisome prolifetor-activated receptor-gamma agonist and <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> 2 -[2 -(4 -phenoxy- 2 -propylphenoxy) ethyl]indole- 5 -acetic acid (COOH) completely prevented the changes in endothelium-dependent relaxation, but, with the discontinuation of therapy, endothelial dysfunction returned. Dysfunctional SMAs were found to specifically upregulate {{the expression of a}} 35 -kDa isoform of sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP), which is a component of the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus and implicated in the regulation of membrane function in muscle cells. Real-time PCR revealed high SLMAP mRNA levels in the db/db microvasculature, which were markedly downregulated during COOH treatment but elevated again when drug therapy was discontinued. These data reveal that the microvasculature in db/db mice undergoes significant changes in vascular function with the endothelial component of vascular dysfunction specifically correlating with the overexpression of SLMAP. Thus changes in SLMAP expression may be an important indicator for microvascular disease associated with Type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Prior {{studies have}} {{reported}} that elevated concentrations of several plasma amino acids (AA), particularly branched chain (BCAA) and aromatic AA predict the onset of type 2 diabetes. We sought {{to test the hypothesis}} that circulating BCAA, aromatic AA and related AA metabolites decline in response to the use of <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> in overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Methods. We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo, controlled study conducted in twenty five overweight/obese (BMI similar to 30 kg/m(2)) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Participants were randomized to three months of pioglitazone (45 mg per day) plus metformin (1000 mg twice per day, N = 12 participants) or placebo (N = 13). We measured insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and fasting concentrations of AA and AA metabolites using ultra-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and after the three-month intervention. Results. Insulin sensitizer therapy that significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity reduced 9 out of 33 AA and AA metabolites measured compared to placebo treatment. Moreover, insulin sensitizer therapy significantly reduced three functionally clustered AA and metabolite pairs: i) phenylalanine/tyrosine, citrulline/arginine, and lysine/alpha-aminoadipic acid. Conclusions. Reductions in plasma concentrations of several AA and AA metabolites in response to three months of insulin sensitizer therapy support the concept that reduced insulin sensitivity alters AA and AA metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) {{is defined as}} any degree of glucose intolerance occurring first time during pregnancy. Its prevalence is simultaneously increasing with the global rise of diabesity. GDM commonly develops, when maternal glucose metabolism is unable {{to compensate for the}} progressive development of insulin resistance, arising primarily from the consistently rising diabetogenic placental hormones. It classically develops during the second or third trimester. Theoretically, insulin sensitizers should have been the ideal agent in its treatment, given the insulin resistance, the major culprit in its pathogenesis. Fortunately, majority of women can be treated satisfactorily with lifestyle modification, and approximately 20 % requires more intensive treatment. For several decades, insulin has been the most reliable treatment strategy and the gold standard in GDM. Metformin is effective <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> and <b>an</b> established first line drug in type 2 diabetes currently. As it crosses the placenta, a safety issue remains an obstacle and, therefore, metformin is currently not recommended in the treatment of GDM. Nevertheless, given the emerging clinically equivalent safety and efficacy data of metformin compared to insulin, it appears that it may perhaps open a rather new door in managing GDM. The aim of this review is to critically analyze, the safety and efficacy data of metformin regarding its use in GDM and pregnant mothers with polycystic ovarian disease, which has emerged in past decades...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes three}} manuscripts related to peripheral arterial disease. The first examines {{the effects of}} assigned glycemic control strategy on the incidence of peripheral arterial disease in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2 D) trial. The BARI 2 D results show that patients assigned to control their type 2 diabetes with a strategy that primarily used <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> (metformin and/or thiazolidinediones) experienced fewer incident cases of peripheral arterial disease than patients assigned to a glycemic control strategy that primarily used insulin providing agents. The second manuscript extends this work by examining risk factors for peripheral arterial disease in the BARI 2 D trial. The analyses included traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as biomarkers indicative of inflammation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. In patients treated with <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> medications, biomarkers of inflammation and related processes were associated with lower extremity outcomes while {{this was not the}} case for patients treated with <b>insulin</b> providing medications, <b>a</b> useful mechanistic insight into how the different types of diabetes drugs may affect the progression of atherosclerosis. The third manuscript reports the results of a data collection project evaluating the reproducibility and reliability of two methods for measuring the ankle-brachial index. Reproducibility was excellent for Doppler-measured ABI, while the Colin oscillometric device showed moderate reproducibility. Agreement between Colin and Doppler was somewhat poor; therefore, we would not recommend the Colin device for measuring ABI in clinical settings. Each manuscript contributes uniquely to public health significance. The first suggests that a glycemic treatment strategy based on insulin sensitizers may reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. The second demonstrated that biomarkers of inflammation and fibrinolysis offer additional predictive value over traditional cardiovascular risk factors for incidence of PAD in type 2 diabetes patients treated with <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> medications, implying that different types of glycemic control medications may have different mechanistic effects on the progression of atherosclerosis. The third reinforces current guidelines that Doppler ABI should remain the primary diagnostic for PAD in clinical and research settings. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> on hormonal and metabolic parameters as well as menstrual patterns in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients with PCOS were included. Metformin was administered to patients at 1, 500 mg or 1, 700 mg daily for 3 months. If the patients had no improvement of the menstrual cycle or metformin-related adverse effects developed, the patients changed medication to a daily dose of either 15 mg pioglitazone or up to 45 mg. Then resumption of a regular menstrual cycle or recovery of ovulation was evaluated. Hormonal and metabolic profiles were compared between the response and non-response group to insulin sensitiz-ing agents. Results: One hundred and five patients with PCOS were treated with metformin for 3 months. Forty-eight patients (45. 7 %) showed improve-ment of menstrual cycle regularity after 3 months of metformin use, whereas 57 patients (54. 3 %) had no change. The mean free testosterone measured after 3 months of treatment was significantly lower in metformin responders than in non-responders. The other parameters did not differ between the groups. Of the 23 patients who used pioglitazone for 3 to 6 months, 19 patients (82. 6 %) showed improvement in their men-strual cycles. Conclusion: Metformin treatment seems to be effective for the improvement of menstrual cyclicity irrespective of insulin resistance in wome...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAimsThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the influence of obesity and insulin resistance on tumor development and, in turn, the effect of <b>insulin</b> <b>sensitizing</b> <b>agents.</b> Main methodsMale offspring of Wistar rats received monosodium glutamate (400 mg/kg) (obese) or saline (control) from the second to sixth day after birth. Sixteen-week-old control and obese rats received 5 × 105 Walker- 256 tumor cells, subcutaneously injected into the right flank. Some of the obese and control rats received concomitant treatment with metformin (300 mg/kg) by gavage. At the 18 th week, obesity was characterized. The percentage of rats that developed tumors, the tumor relative weight and the percentage of cachexia incidence were analyzed. The tumor tissue was evaluated histologically by means of hematoxylin and eosin staining. Key findingsMetformin did not correct the insulin resistance in obese rats. The tumor development was significantly higher in the obese group, whereas metformin treatment reduced it. After pathological analysis, we observed that the tumor tissues were similar in all groups except for adipocytes, which were found in greater quantity in the obese and metformin-treated obese groups. The area of tumor necrosis was higher in the group treated with metformin when compared with the untreated one. SignificanceMetformin reduced Walker- 256 tumor development but not cachexia in obese rats. The reduction occurred independently of the correction of insulin resistance. Metformin increased the area of necrosis in tumor tissues, which may have contributed to the reduced tumor development...|$|R
