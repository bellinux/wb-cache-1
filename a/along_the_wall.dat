5|$|Bouchard {{was one of}} nine {{players and}} one builder elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966. On October 15, 2008, the Montreal Canadiens celebrated their 100th season by {{unveiling}} the Ring of Honour, an exhibit <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the upper deck of the Bell Centre, paying tribute to their 44 players and 10 builders {{who are members of}} the Hockey Hall of Fame. Bouchard along with Elmer Lach, the two oldest surviving members, were on hand to drop the ceremonial puck at centre ice.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June 626, {{a coordinated}} {{assault on the}} walls began. Inside the walls, some 12,000 well-trained Byzantine cavalry troops (presumably dismounted) defended the city {{against the forces of}} some 80,000 Avars and Slavs. Despite {{continuous}} bombardment for a month, morale was high inside the walls of Constantinople because of Patriarch Sergius' religious fervor and his processions <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> with the icon of the Virgin Mary, inspiring the belief that the Byzantines were under divine protection.|$|E
5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.|$|E

5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} shot in a revamped version of the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E

5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways around the top. A stone gatehouse was built {{on the west side of}} the wall, leading from the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, Worcester {{first became}} {{the capital of}} the Hwicce kingdom, and later formed part of the wider kingdom of Mercia. Worcester and its defences were reorganised by Ealdorman Æthelred and Æthelflæd and bishop Werferth in the 890s. This {{involved}} creating a burh, a fortified Anglo-Saxon town; in Worcester this took the form of a planned settlement, extending out from the old Roman defences, with the Shambles forming a street running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> on the east. Archaeological evidence suggests that the burh had 4,650 feet (1,417 m) of walls in total; documentary evidence from the Burghal Hidage document, written shortly after the creation of the walls, suggests they were 4,960 feet (1,512 m) long, a discrepancy that may be accounted for by changes {{in the course of the}} river since the 10th century. The walls incorporated the old Roman fortifications on the south and south-east side of the city and appear to have included a defensive ditch, with a revetment supporting a wooden palisade.|$|E
5|$|The outer bailey is {{the southernmost}} {{feature of the}} castle; it is {{pentagon}} shaped and there are five towers spaced <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, {{the wall of the}} middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Château Gaillard {{was one of the first}} castles in Europe to use machicolations—stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8thcentury.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2012 revealed that the effect {{is due to the}} particular shape of the glass coupled with the small bubble size found in stout beers. If the vessel widens with height then bubbles will sink <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> – this is the case for the standard pint glass. Conversely, in an anti-pint (i.e. if the vessel narrows with height) bubbles will rise <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

25|$|Towers that {{protruded}} {{from the}} wall were located at regular intervals <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Large and elaborate towers, called corner towers (角楼, Jiǎolóu), were placed where two walls joined (i.e. at corners). These {{were significantly higher than}} the wall itself, and gave defenders a bird's eye view over both the city and its surroundings.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupation}} of the turrets seems to have occurred in distinct phases. The first was the initial occupation immediately after construction (from 122AD onwards), and remained in use after the construction of forts <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> line. As {{with many of the}} Wall's defences, the turrets were abandoned in favour of the Antonine Wall around 142AD. During this period of abandonment, many turrets were robbed of building stone, possibly by the remaining Roman garrisons.|$|E
