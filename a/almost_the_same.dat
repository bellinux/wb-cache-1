5|$|Germination of cysts is {{accompanied}} by changes in the intima, visible with an electron microscope. The intima consists of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and has <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> volume as the central body. During germination of cysts, the intima hydrolyses and {{is used by the}} cell for the synthesis its components.|$|E

5|$|The {{program of}} the Afro-Asian Games was <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{as that of the}} Asian Games, the only {{difference}} being in the number of sports. These Games witnessed eight disciplines in eight sports. Synchronised swimming and diving were not contested.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
30|$|In WF temperature, kMNF {{decreased}} as {{the temperature}} rose [16], but kW <b>almost</b> remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> [17]. Similarly, CMNF decreased slightly {{as the temperature}} rose, but CW <b>almost</b> remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> [14]. Effectively, kMNFCW / kWCMNF is smaller at high temperatures than at low temperatures if the effect of CMNF is smaller than that of kMNF.|$|R

5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part {{in an attempt to}} reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system. For the 2004 European elections too, a new system less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E
5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|From the Second Age on, Quenya {{was also}} used ceremonially by the Men of Númenór and their {{descendants}} in Gondor and Arnor for the official names of kings and queens; this practice was resumed by Aragorn {{when he took the}} crown as Elessar Telcontar. Quenya in the Third Age had <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> status as the Latin language had in medieval Europe, and was called Elven-latin by Tolkien.|$|E

5|$|In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part for {{themselves}} and leaving Ceolwulf with the west. The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2014, {{three years}} and two days after this tornado, a violent EF4 tornado touched down west of Ferndale and moved along <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path as this tornado, causing 16 {{fatalities}} and many injuries. However, it affected more of Mayflower than this tornado did and caused greater damage all along the path, especially in Vilonia, before lifting near El Paso.|$|E
5|$|The average {{level of}} non-revenue water (physical and {{economic}} losses) in Colombia in 2006 {{is estimated to}} be 49%. This level is higher than the Latin American average (approximately 40%) and the regulatory goal of 30%. In the past, the national average of non-revenue water was estimated 40% in 2001, which is <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in 1990. In the largest cities of the country, levels of non-revenue water are below the national average (40% in Bogotá, 35% in Medellín and 39% in Cali).|$|E

5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Belgium varied little over the period. Belgium's border with the Netherlands was <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{as that which}} had been created after the Dutch Revolt in the early 17th century, and its western border was <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{as those of the}} 18th-century polities the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège. It was only after the French annexation of 1795 that the territory became a single entity. In the 1830s, Belgian revolutionaries sought to create an independent state within the borders of the nine provinces that had been established under French occupation while ending the traditional roles of the small duchies, princedoms and counties which had traditionally been the basic territorial units. Aside from Zeelandic Flanders, part of Luxembourg, and Northern Limburg, which were ceded to the Dutch to compensate for the loss {{of the rest of the}} territory, the outline of Belgium in 1914 was virtually identical to that established by the French in 1795. The three ceded territories had a total of 300,000 inhabitants at the time.|$|E
5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just {{far enough}} away to have <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|$|E

5|$|When {{the order}} was placed, {{it was the first}} Norwegian {{electric}} locomotive with the mechanical components built in Germany. At the same time, NSB ordered five six-axle diesel-electric locomotives from Thyssen-Henschel (Mark Di 4), <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the Danish Mark ME 1500. The Di 4/ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17. The two were planned to have the same rectifiers and motors, but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120.|$|E
5|$|While the {{gameplay}} remained <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as {{in previous}} titles, the game introduced a four-player battle mode, and the PS2 version included new features to the series, including a scrolling adventure, a customization mode, and two new characters. Guilty Gear Isuka received mixed critical reviews. It was praised for its visual, music and customization features. However, although {{some aspects of}} the new gameplay—such as the two fighting planes and the turn button—were praised as original, their implementation was criticized. The removal of features present in previous titles was also not well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|At <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as Chesapeake {{lost control}} of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over {{the deck of the}} British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
