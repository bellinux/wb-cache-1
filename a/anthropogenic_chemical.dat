Here they show the links between nature and nurture need to be redefined to accommodate <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>chemical</b> contamination. The fact is that at the global level environmental recovery is not possible. In recognizing and accepting this worldwide change, the types of adaptations that have occurred as a consequence must be considered. In addition, they proposed a fundamental shift in the field that integrates various disciplines involved in the study of environmental contamination to recognize that contamination is widespread and cannot be remedied at the global level. Thus, greater effort must be placed on integrative and interdisciplinary studies that explicitly illuminate how the causal mechanisms and functional outcomes of related processes operate at each level of biological organization {{while at the same time}} revealing the relations among the levels. This article caused a good deal of comment, and with analysis now extending to the problem of evolution in a contaminated world.

Results of heavy metal studies in aerosols obtained during 11 research expeditions in summer/autumn period from 1991 to 2000, and at Severnaya Zemlya and Wrangel Island in spring, in 1985 – 1989 are discussed. Concentrations of most heavy metals in {{the atmosphere in the}} marine boundary layer in the Russian Arctic are nearly of the same order as literature data from other Arctic areas. The content of heavy metals in the aerosols over the seas of the Russian Arctic shows an annual variation with maximal concentrations during the winter/spring season.

40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} a great deal of {{international}} discussion on the nature and relevance of endocrine disrupting compounds in the environment. Changes in reproductive organs of fish and mollusks have been demonstrated in rivers downstream of sewage discharges in Europe and in North America, which have been attributed to estrogenic compounds in the effluent. The anatomical and physiological changes in the fauna are illustrated by feminization of male gonads. The compounds of greatest hormonal activity in sewage effluent are the natural estrogens 17 β-estradiol, estrone, estriol and the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol. Androgens are also widely present in wastewaters. Investigations of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>chemical</b> contaminants in freshwaters and wastewaters have shown a wide variety of organic compounds, many of which have low levels of estrogenic activity. In many highly populated countries the drinking water is sourced from the same rivers and lakes that are the recipients of sewage and industrial discharge. The River Thames which flows through London, England, has overall passed through drinking water and sewage discharge 5 times from source to mouth of the river. Under these types of circumstance, any accumulation of endocrine disrupting compounds from sewage or industry potentially affects the quality of drinking water. Neither basic wastewater treatment nor basic drinking water treatment will eliminate the estrogens, androgens or detergent breakdown products from water, due to the chemical stability of the structures. Hence a potential risk to health exists; however present data indicate tha...|$|E

This herbicide is known to have non-targeted undesirable effects on humans, animals and soil microbes, but specific molecular targets at sublethal levels are unknown. In this study, we have used Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 (Rlv) as a nitrogen fixing, beneficial model soil organism to characterize the effects of 2, 4 -D. Using metabolomics and advanced microscopy we determined specific target pathways in the Rlv metabolic network and consequent changes to its phenotype, surface ultrastructure, and physical properties during sublethal 2, 4 -D exposure. Auxin and 2, 4 -D, its structural analogue, showed common morphological changes in vitro which were similar to bacteroids isolated from plant nodules, implying that these changes are related to bacteroid differentiation required for nitrogen fixation. Rlv showed remarkable adaptation capabilities in response to the herbicide, with changes to integral pathways of cellular metabolism and the potential to assimilate 2, 4 -D with consequent changes to its physical and structural properties. This study identifies biomarkers of 2, 4 -D in Rlv and offers valuable insights into the mode-of-action of 2, 4 -D in soil bacteria...|$|E

Using sensitive biomarkers such as Vitellogenin (VTG), Zona Radiata Protein (ZRP), sex hormone pathways and CYP 1 A activities (EROD, BPMO), exposure and effects of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>chemical</b> have been studied in more than 200 Mediterranean specimens.

These fish showed higher levels of both proteins and 17 β-estradiol than mean levels in males from reference sites, suggesting high exposure to xenoestrogens in the Mediterranean Sea. A role of Organochlorines in this induction phenomenon is suggested by statistically significant correlations found between VTG and ZRP levels in males and levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in gonads (p< 0. 05), plasma 17 β-estradiol and polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) in gonads (p< 0. 05), ZRP and pp’DDE in liver (p< 0. 06).

Specifically, the role of emissions of biogenic halogenated species for the stratospheric halogen budget and the role of increasing emissions of SO 2 in Southeast Asia or from minor volcanic eruptions for the increasing stratospheric aerosol loading need to be reassessed in light of these findings.
