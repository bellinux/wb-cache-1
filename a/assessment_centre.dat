In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses both on and off campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One {{of his first}} changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, {{as well as an}} <b>assessment</b> <b>centre</b> to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E

Although <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> are are a popular technique {{that has been used}} and studied for at least 50 years, primarily in Western countries (Thornton & Rupp, 2006), there is a general lack of research into the implementation and effectiveness in developing countries in spite of a widespread growth in their use in recent years (Thornton & Krause, 2009). Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how cultural differences may influence the implementation of <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> and how this might differ from its implementation in more developed nations. In this regards, this paper focuses on exploring the acceptance of <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> in Malaysia by using the organisational justice theory. Based on literature review, a conceptual framework of how the Malaysian culture may influence the acceptance of <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> in Malaysian public sectors will be proposed...|$|R

40|$|Both <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> and 360 degree {{feedback}} {{have become}} very popular new era HR tools. With human resources gaining strategic importance combined with raising costs of talented managers and their scarce availability, organizations are left with no alternatives than identifying and grooming talent from within. This {{has led to the}} increased use of <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> and 360 degree tools for developing leadership competencies. Some times 360 degree feedback is used as tool for career development and succession planning. Sometimes <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> are used as predictors of fast track managers. However research on the predictive ability of ACs or 360 degree feedback is scant. This study is based on data gathered from three organizations that have conducted <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> as well as 360 degree feedback. In all three organizations ACs and 360 degree feedback were used as development tools. In all these organizations competency mapping was done and common competencies were identified using behaviour indicators. Competencies were assessed by external assessors and by their seniors, juniors, and colleagues on the same competency model. Results showed no definite patterns and lead to the conclusion that past performance as assessed by 360 degree feedback predictor of future potential as assessed by the <b>assessment</b> <b>centres.</b> The findings seem to be valid irrespective of the nature of competencies assessed and across various categories of employees. Given the lack of correlation, caution is necessary while using the data for promotion and succession planning exercises. ...|$|R

These centres comprise {{of a number of}} instruments which {{are used to}} establish competencies needed to perform effectively. The validity of this measure is yet to be fully ascertained as previous studies have shown that although <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> have predictive validity, they lack construct validity. The research study therefore set out to establish whether <b>assessment</b> <b>centres</b> used within financial institutions have predictive validity but lack construct validity. For purposes of this study, two sets of data each comprising of responses from 120 and 91 employees were used. This data was retrieved from a financial institution within the Western Cape. Contrary to previous studies, there was low predictive validity within this study. Some of the factors that could have contributed to the low correlation between performance and assessment ratings include a rather small sample that was used, having different criterion being measured in the evaluations than in the <b>assessment</b> <b>centres,</b> range restriction, complexity of assessing behaviour, and having a number of dimensions from which to derive an Overall Assessment Rating (OAR). However, similar to previous studies, this study also found low construct validity amongst the ratings. In addition, a further analysis indicated that both performance and personality measures are valid methods in predicting performance...|$|R

A university graduate {{with a major}} in psychology, {{he was the first}} senior appointment from outside the Western Australian prison system in almost half a century. He viewed prison as [...] "a place for rehabilitation and re-education ... where people can retain their identity and, if necessary, create a new identity". One of his first changes was to make himself chairman of the classification committee, and clear its backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment through more frequent committee meetings. Campbell also established an officer training school, as well as an <b>assessment</b> <b>centre,</b> where new prisoners worked, supervised by specially trained officers who gave reports to the classification committee. Following international trends, Campbell introduced work release and community service programs, training programs for both prisoners and officers, and social workers and welfare officers to assist prisoners and their families during and after their imprisonment.|$|E

[...] This destruction necessarily led to {{a fair amount of}} reconstruction {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. [...] Another factor in Bolsover Street's changing face in the last century has been the continued growth and development of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. The most recent instance of this has been the opening of the new central London Outpatient <b>Assessment</b> <b>Centre</b> and the associated residential development. [...] The Centre maintains the Hospital's original Outpatients’ Hall with murals by Nan West, a student of the Slade School, The murals cover some 90 square metres and are reminiscent of the pre-Raphaelites.
