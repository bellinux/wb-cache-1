Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties. He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader Ralph Reader's RAF Gang Show entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him <b>and</b> <b>Sellers</b> toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India. His tour also included Ceylon and Burma, although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, <b>and</b> <b>Sellers</b> may have exaggerated its length. He also served in Germany and France after the war.|$|E
5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers <b>and</b> <b>sellers.</b> Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 Sellers {{made his}} directorial debut with Mr. Topaze, {{in which he}} also starred. The film {{was based on the}} Marcel Pagnol play Topaze. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial {{abilities}} received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike, <b>and</b> <b>Sellers</b> rarely referred to it again. The same year he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed Only Two Can Play, a film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling), and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Surrey Canal in 1811 changed the {{character}} of the road from rural to industrial. Tanneries were established along it and a soap processing plant was built. Older properties occupied by the upper and middle classes were converted into flats for the emerging working class population. By the time Bricklayers Arms goods station opened in 1845, the road was entirely built up and Old Kent Road had one of the highest population densities in Europe, with an average of 280 residents per acre. Sections along the road were commercial with various market stalls <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> until the construction of the tramway in 1871. Camberwell Public Library No.1, which later became the Livesey Museum for Children was designed by Sir George Livesey in 1890. The road's southern section remained residential throughout the 19th century. Nos.864, 866 and 880–884 were constructed by John Lamb in 1815, and feature Ammonite capitals, ornamental features resembling fossils, a feature also used in contemporary architecture in Brighton.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a middleman on the search and trading behavior of the traders. It is shown that the buyer <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> types with middle valuations choose to search for each other, while the buyer <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> types with high or low valuations drop out of the search market and choose to trade directly with the middleman. The ask and bid prices of the middleman act as an outside option for the buyer <b>and</b> <b>seller,</b> <b>and</b> influence the outcome of the bargaining between the two. The model generalizes Gehrig (1993) by endogenizing the traders' search intensities, by allowing the traders to go to an intermediary even if thy have engaged in search, and by enabling the intermediary to provide the service of immediacy.

25|$|Marx {{also argues}} that, insofar as {{capitalist}} class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature {{of how it}} actually operates. Buyers <b>and</b> <b>sellers</b> compete with other buyers <b>and</b> <b>sellers.</b> Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for {{their share of the}} new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, but necessary, and the more one is able to know about others, the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Short PapersInternational audienceIn e-marketplaces {{with limited}} {{inventory}} where buyers’ demand {{is larger than}} sellers’ supply, promoting honesty raises new challenges: sellers may behave dishonestly because they can sell out all products without the necessity of gaining high reputation; buyers may provide untruthful ratings to mislead other buyers {{in order to have}} a higher chance to obtain the limited products. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to promote buyer <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> honesty in such e-marketplaces. More specifically, our mechanism models both buyer <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> honesty. It offers higher prices to the products provided by honest sellers so that the sellers can gain larger utility. Honest buyers also have a higher chance to do business with honest <b>sellers</b> <b>and</b> are able to gain larger utility. Experimental results confirm that our mechanism promotes both buyer <b>and</b> <b>seller</b> honesty...|$|R
