5|$|Clacks, 2014, by Backspindle Games (Designers: Leonard Boyd & David Brashaw), Published in {{conjunction}} with Z-Man Games. In this game players compete to send their 'message' on a clacks board while disrupting their opponents' messages. It resembles the game <b>Amoeba,</b> with its constantly changing board.|$|E
5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology {{is the study}} of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology {{is the study of}} observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of <b>amoeba.</b>|$|E
5|$|New venues in {{the game}} include virtual recreations of real arenas, such as Ozzfest, <b>Amoeba</b> Music, Live Nation’s House of Blues, Sunset Strip and San Francisco’s AT Park. One venue showcases the {{trademark}} art style of Tool and was developed {{in collaboration with the}} band. World Tour is the first Activision game on the PlayStation 3 to support dynamic in-game advertising provided by IGA Worldwide; similar advertising for the Xbox 360 version is provided by Massive Incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|The formal {{taxonomy}} of protosteloid <b>amoebae</b> groups them all according to fruiting bodies, mostly leaving out {{characteristics of the}} <b>amoebae.</b> Recent {{studies have shown that}} all protosteloid <b>amoebae</b> studied to date are probably included in the group known as Amoebozoa or Eumyceotzoa. [...] However, protosteloid <b>amoebae</b> are not all closely related and some fall within groups of <b>amoebae</b> in which the other <b>amoebae</b> are nonfruiting. [...] Therefore, it appears that the ability to make fruiting bodies may have evolved more than once.|$|R
50|$|L. pneumophila {{thrives in}} aquatic systems {{where it is}} {{established}} within <b>amoebae</b> in a symbiotic relationship. Legionella bacteria survive in water as intracellular parasites of water-dwelling protozoae, such as <b>amoebae.</b> <b>Amoebae</b> are often part of biofilms, and once Legionella and infected <b>amoebae</b> are protected within a biofilm, they are particularly difficult to destroy.|$|R
50|$|Testate <b>amoebae</b> taxa are {{differentiated}} {{by their}} test characteristics {{and the type}} of pseudopodia (lobose or filose). Testate lobose <b>amoebae</b> (Testacealobosia) produce wide pseudopodia while testate filose <b>amoebae</b> (Testaceafilosia) produce slender pseudopods.|$|R
5|$|Python was {{conceived}} {{in the late}} 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system <b>Amoeba.</b> Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python {{is reflected in the}} title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).|$|E

Under Dobell, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae found in the human gastrointestinal tract, focusing on the species responsible for amoebic dysentery, Entamoeba histolytica. Dobell, Bishop, and Patrick Laidlaw studied the effects of amoebicides like emetine {{for the purpose of}} treating amoebal diseases. Later in her career, she named the <b>amoeba</b> genus Dobellina after her mentor.|$|E
5|$|Green Day {{began the}} {{recording}} process for 21st Century Breakdown in January 2008. Later that year, it was {{confirmed that the}} band worked with producer Butch Vig. The album was recorded with Vig throughout 2008 and into early 2009 at four locations in California: Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, Studio 880 in Oakland, Jel Studios in Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa Studios in Costa Mesa. While recording in Hollywood, the band members bought cheap turntables from <b>Amoeba</b> Music and listened to many vinyl records for inspiration, including albums by The Beat and The Plimsouls. Armstrong cited as inspiration the music of The Kinks' Ray Davies, The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow, The Doors' The Doors and Strange Days, and Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell. Drummer Tré Cool noted the influence of Eddie Cochran and The Creation on Armstrong's writing.|$|E

40|$|A fluorimetric assay {{has been}} used to {{determine}} the DNA content of <b>amoebae</b> of Dictyostelium discoideum during growth and development. <b>Amoebae</b> grown in axenic culture tended to be multinucleate and had a greater DNA content than <b>amoebae</b> grown with a bacterial substrate, which were mononucleate. During the first 10 h of development there was little change in the DNA content of <b>amoebae</b> grown with a bacterial substrate, but the average DNA content per cell in <b>amoebae</b> grown axenically decreased as the <b>amoebae</b> became virtually mononucleate. <b>Amoebae</b> at 10 h development that had been harvested during exponential axenic growth were divided into two populations by countercurrent distribution in a polymer two-phase system. DNA content indicated that one population was largely in the G 2 -phase of the cell cycle, whereas the other population was largely in the G 1 -phase. Similar results were obtained at 10 h development with <b>amoebae</b> harvested during the stationary phase of axenic growth, although these <b>amoebae</b> start development all in the G 2 -phase of the cell cycle. Spores had a low DNA content, indicating that they were in G 1 -phase. It is proposed that all <b>amoebae</b> in G 2 -phase after early development differentiate, after mitosis, into spores and that stalk cells are formed from <b>amoebae</b> that remain in G 1 -phase after 10 h development...|$|R

5|$|The {{water that}} {{flows through the}} Roman Baths is {{considered}} unsafe for bathing, partly due to its having passed through the still-functioning original lead pipes, and up until World War II, it was advertised {{on the basis of}} the radioactivity it contained. However, the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases. In October 1978, a young girl swimming with the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed that Naegleria fowleri, an extremely dangerous disease-causing <b>amoeba,</b> was in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes.|$|E

25|$|Chemotaxis {{is defined}} as a passage of an {{organism}} toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In D. discoideum, the <b>amoeba</b> secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every <b>amoeba</b> moves toward a central <b>amoeba,</b> the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and <b>amoeba</b> movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Amoebae</b> grazing {{can be an}} {{important}} loss factor for blooms of the common cyanobacterium Microcystis. Some Microcystis strains seem to be protected against <b>amoebae</b> grazing, but it is unclear whether this is achieved by their colony morphology or biochemically. These factors were investigated in grazing experiments using two Microcystis-grazing <b>amoebae</b> (Korotnevella sp. and Vannella sp.) and two Microcystis strains with differing colony morphology (aeruginosa and viridis morphotype) and different sensitivity to <b>amoebae</b> grazing. <b>Amoebae</b> did not increase in density and failed to reduce the growth rate of cultures of the <b>amoebae</b> insensitive viridis strain, irrespective of whether the Microcystis strain was colonial or unicellular. This suggests that the extended mucilage matrix surrounding viridis colonies is not the main defence mechanism against <b>amoebae</b> grazing. At the same time, the growth rate of both unicellular and colonial cultures of the amoebae-sensitive aeruginosa strain was heavily reduced by the growing <b>amoebae.</b> The addition of filtered viridis-conditioned medium to aeruginosa cultures significantly decreased both <b>amoebae</b> growth and its effect on aeruginosa growth rates, which indicates that extracellular compounds constitutively produced by viridis are at least partially responsible for their insensitivity to <b>amoebae</b> grazing. These results demonstrate the potential importance of chemical interactions between lower trophic levels (protists) for Microcystis bloom dynamics...|$|R

Given the evidence that several pathogenic species replicate within <b>amoebae</b> and emerge more virulent and more resistant and the abundance of <b>amoebae</b> in healthcare settings, we investigated interactions of Acanthamoeba polyphaga with epidemic MRSA isolates. MRSA proliferated {{in the presence of}} <b>amoebae,</b> attributable partly to intracellular replication. Following 24 h of co-culture, confocal microscopy revealed that c. 50 % <b>amoebae</b> had viable MRSA within phago-lysosomes and 2 % of <b>amoebae</b> were heavily infected with viable cocci throughout the cytoplasm.

25|$|Increased arsenic, nitrate and {{fluoride}} contamination {{was detected}} {{in drinking water}} in various localities in Pakistan, according to an official government document. Generally, water pressure is low in Pakistani supply systems. Together with leaky pipes, this leads to infiltration of contaminated water. A survey of drinking water samples in Karachi in 2007/08 found that, of 216 ground and surface water samples collected, 86% had lead levels higher than the WHO maximum acceptable concentration of 10 parts per billion (ppb). The mean lead concentration was 146 ppb in untreated ground water and 77 ppb in treated tap water. In 2012, according to Rafiq Khanani, professor and pathology chairman at the Dow University of Health Sciences, water-borne Naegleria fowleri have killed at least 10 people in Karachi in three months. The infection does not occur by drinking water infested with the <b>amoeba,</b> but if water enters the nose. The <b>amoeba</b> then attack the brain and cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Newspapers reported that drinking water was provided without any treatment or disinfection, which facilitated {{the spread of the}} <b>amoeba.</b> As a reaction to the findings, a citizen of Karachi submitted a court petition asking the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board to fulfill its duty to provide clean water. In October 2012, the Sindh High Court issued a notice to the Board asking it to comment on the petition.|$|E

40|$|Free-living <b>amoebae,</b> mainly Acanthamoebae and Naegleriae, {{have been}} {{detected}} in almost every water sample taken {{in the course of}} potable water treatment in six treatment plants. While <b>amoebae</b> are only to a minor degree sensitive to chemical disinfection, <b>amoebae</b> concentration is largely reduced by flocculation, sedimendation and also by filtration. In the filtration stage care must be taken to avoid recontamination by <b>amoebae</b> enriched at the surface of the filter material. Up to 300 <b>amoebae</b> per liter drinking water were found even in samples from household installation. The <b>amoebae</b> act as hosts for a variety of bacteria, e. g.

25|$|An elegant set of {{mathematical}} equations that reproduces the spirals and the streaming patterns of D. discoideum {{was discovered by}} mathematical biologists Thomas Höfer and Martin Boerlijst. Mathematical biologist Cornelis J. Weijer has proven that similar equations can model its movement. The equations of these patterns are mainly influenced by {{the density of the}} <b>amoeba</b> population, the rate of the production of cyclic AMP and the sensitivity of individual amoebas to cyclic AMP. The spiraling pattern is formed by amoebas at the centre of a colony who rotate as they send out waves of cyclic AMP.|$|E
25|$|Legionella is a {{parasite}} of protozoans such as <b>amoeba,</b> and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often include very hot water flushes (160°F; 70°C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, {{and in some}} cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120°F (50°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.|$|E
25|$|Dictyostelium discoideum is {{a species}} of soil-living <b>amoeba</b> {{belonging}} to the phylum Amoebozoa, infraphylum Mycetozoa. Commonly referred to as slime mold, D. discoideum is a eukaryote that transitions from a collection of unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The lifecycle of D. discoideum is relatively short, which allows for timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are applicable to human cancer research. The simplicity of its lifecycle makes D. discoideum a valuable model organism to study genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.|$|E
40|$|Thermotaxis by {{individual}} <b>amoebae</b> of Dictyostelium discoideum on a temperature gradient is described. These <b>amoebae</b> show positive thermotaxis at temperatures between 14 °C and 28 °C shortly (3 hr) after food depletion. Increasing {{time on the}} gradient reduces the positive thermotactic response at the lower temperature gradients (midpoint temperatures of 14, 16, and 18 °C), and <b>amoebae</b> show an apparent negative thermotactic response after 12 hr on the gradient. The thermotaxis response curve for “wild-type” <b>amoebae</b> after 16 hr on the gradient {{is similar to that}} shown for the pseudoplasmodia. Growth of the <b>amoebae</b> at a different temperature causes a shift in the thermotaxis response curve for the <b>amoebae.</b> This adaptation is similar to that shown for the pseudoplasmodia. Two mutants in thermotaxis, HO 428 and HO 813, show changes in amoebal thermotaxis similar to the observed changes in pseudoplasmodial thermotaxis. On the basis of the similarities between these responses, thermotaxis by the <b>amoebae</b> is proposed to be the basis for thermotaxis by the multicellular pseudoplasmodium...|$|R
40|$|Testate <b>amoebae</b> are a {{group of}} shelled {{protozoa}} that occur in high density populations in wet environments.

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is a soil fungus {{that causes}} {{life-threatening}} meningitis in immunocompromised patients {{and is a}} facultative intracellular pathogen capable of replication inside macrophages. The mechanism by which environmental fungi acquire and maintain virulence for mammalian hosts is unknown. We hypothesized that the survival strategies for Cn after ingestion by macrophages and <b>amoebae</b> were similar. Microscopy, fungal and <b>amoebae</b> killing assays, and phagocytosis assays revealed that Cn is phagocytosed by and replicates in Acanthamoeba castellanii, which leads to death of <b>amoebae.</b> An acapsular strain of Cn did not survive when incubated with <b>amoebae,</b> but melanization protected these cells against killing by <b>amoebae.</b> A phospholipase mutant had a decreased replication rate in <b>amoebae</b> compared with isogenic strains. These observations suggest that cryptococcal characteristics that contribute to mammalian virulence also promote fungal survival in <b>amoebae.</b> Intracellular replication was accompanied by the accumulation of polysaccharide containing vesicles similar to those described in Cn-infected macrophages. The {{results suggest that the}} virulence of Cn for mammalian cells is a consequence of adaptations that have evolved for protection against environmental predators such as <b>amoebae</b> and provide an explanation for the broad host range of this pathogenic fungus...|$|R

25|$|The {{split between}} {{classical}} and some atypical MAP kinases happened quite early. This is suggested {{not just by}} the high divergence between extant genes, but also recent discoveries of atypical MAPKs in primitive, basal eukaryotes. The genome sequencing of Giardia lamblia revealed the presence of two MAPK genes, one of them similar to the already-well-known mammalian MAPKs (ERKs, p38s, etc.), the other one showing similarities to the mammalian ERK7 protein. The situation is similar in the multicellular <b>amoeba</b> Dictyostelium discoideum, where the ddERK1 protein {{appears to be a}} classical MAPK, while ddERK2 more closely resembles our ERK7 and ERK3/4 proteins. Atypical MAPKs can also be found in higher plants, although they are poorly known. Similar to the situation in mammals, most aspects of atypical MAPKs are uncharacterized {{due to the lack of}} research focus on this area.|$|E
