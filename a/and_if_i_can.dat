500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together."

Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help, that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E

Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research. Morris explained in a July 2013 interview, prior to the reopening of the case: [...] "What happened here is wrong. It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help correct that, I will be a happy camper." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the tour}} began {{to sell out}} all over Europe and the UK, many fans speculated that Minogue would bring her tour to Australia and Japan. While {{promoting}} her ITV special, The Kylie Show on [...] "Sunrise", she stated: [...] "I {{just want to have}} in my head more solidly what the tour will be <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> manage what I have so far, I would love to come back [...] ".

2500|$|With Nixon's resignation, Congress {{dropped its}} {{impeachment}} proceedings. Criminal prosecution {{was still a}} possibility both on {{the federal and state}} level. Nixon was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional pardon of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had “committed or may have committed or taken part in” as president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was {{in the best interest of}} the country. He said that the Nixon family’s situation “is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it.

2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|E
2500|$|General Hindman reacted {{quickly to}} what he {{perceived}} as Burleson’s fear and refusal to fight. On June 19, General Hindman relieved Col Burleson from command and turned the regiment over to Lt. Col. Matlock. [...] The next day on June 20, 1862, Col Burleson telegraphed to General Hindman stating “I received your dispatch and have turned over the command to Col. Matlock with 858 men organized and by night I would have had 1000. [...] I am proud to be relieved of the command and also proud of the success I have had over here in raising troops. I will go to my regiment as soon as I can. In conclusion allow me to return to you my sincere thanks for the honor you conferred in giving me the command over here on Cache, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be of service to my country or the cause you are engaged in, at any time, call on Burleson.” [...] Lt. Col. Matlock was directed to obtain mounts for his infantry companies and then proceed with the formal organization of a regiment and send recommendations for field and staff officers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} no doubt of that, Bullen; so I mean to spend all the time I have to spare here on my back; <b>and</b> sleep, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> continuously." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps I'll {{go in with}} you, after all. I'll just {{step out}} into the cold air, <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> harden my cheek for that interview. Your diffidence is infectious, Maxwell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{answer to}} your {{question}} may be there," [...] he said. [...] "Read the letter while you have the chance. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> advise you, say so at once." ...|$|E
