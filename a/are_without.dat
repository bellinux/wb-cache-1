5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who <b>are</b> <b>without</b> symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they <b>are</b> <b>without</b> money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. He says {{there will be no}} more attacks, as they need peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three agree that they should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women <b>are</b> <b>without</b> birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents <b>are</b> <b>without</b> electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine other people were from an apartment building near Great Mills. Two people are injured and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a drainage ditch before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|That praises <b>are</b> <b>without</b> reason lavished on the dead, {{and that}} the honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E
