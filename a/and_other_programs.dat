5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs</b> increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E
5|$|Public school {{instruction}} in music in Baltimore began in 1843. Prior to that, itinerant and professional singing masters were the dominant form of formal {{music education in}} the state. Music institutions like the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra sometimes have programs aimed at youth education, and other organizations have a similar focus. The Eubie Blake Center exists to promote African American culture, and music, to both youth and adults, through dance classes for all age groups, workshops, clinics, seminars <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E

5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. It is common to find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs</b> {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E
5|$|The school {{relied heavily}} on donations, which made up over {{ten percent of the}} total budget. The Friends of SCPA (commonly known as The Friends), a nonprofit {{organization}} led by parents and members of the business and arts communities, had been a vital source of funding since the school's inception. In 1984, The Friends raised over $400,000 to pay the salaries of the artistic director, technical director, costume designer, and dance, strings, and production teachers. In later years, The Friends raised up to $1million each year through special events, corporate gifts and sponsorships, advertising sales, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs</b> to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries, production expenses, scholarships for private lessons, and artists in residence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1910 and 1920, Auburn High changed from an academy of the classic 19th-century model, {{focusing}} on the traditional Latin course, to a high school offering vocational and technical courses {{in addition to the}} academic offerings. Auburn High added vocational courses to the curriculum in 1918, the eighth high school in the state to implement such a program. Over the next two decades, Auburn High developed its modern extracurricular face, forming band, choir, drama, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs,</b> as well as diversifying occupational classes. In 1925, Auburn High {{became one of the first}} high schools in the state to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. A new school building was constructed in 1931, and in 1956, the school was officially renamed Auburn High School.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs</b> around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E
