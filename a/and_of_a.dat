5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

5|$|Back in Paris {{with two}} years of his grant remaining, Bizet was {{temporarily}} secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.|$|E
5|$|Drawings {{scratched}} on slate {{have been}} found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits {{of an old man}} <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young, bearded man <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-legged animal. The drawings were found in the Viking levels but are Pictish in style and may either pre-date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next. Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way. The Viking-style loom weights, spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design. A bronzegilt harness mounting made in Ireland in the 8th or 9th centuries has also been found and many items from this period are in the Shetland Museum. Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 1263 {{the dispute}} with the Scottish king over the Hebrides induced Haakon to {{undertake}} an expedition to the islands. Having learned in 1262 that Scottish nobles had raided the Hebrides and that Alexander III planned to conquer the islands, Haakon went on an expedition with his formidable leidang fleet of at least 120 ships in 1263, having become accustomed to negotiating backed by an intimidating fleet. The fleet left Bergen in July, and reached Shetland and Orkney in August where {{they were joined by}} chieftains from the Hebrides and Man. Negotiations were started by Alexander following Norwegian landings on the Scottish mainland, but were purposely prolonged by the Scots. Having waited until September/October for weather that caused trouble for Haakon's fleet, a clash occurred between a smaller Norwegian force and a Scottish division at the Battle of Largs. Although inconclusive <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limited impact, Haakon withdrew to Orkney for the winter. A delegation of Irish kings invited Haakon to help them rid Ireland of English settlers as High King of Ireland, but this was apparently rejected against Haakon's wish.|$|E

Modern scholars favoring Hamilton have portrayed Jefferson and his allies, in contrast, as naïve, dreamy idealists.

The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of Galicia being a historical part of the Crown of Poland, for which he was denounced by Ukrainian nationalist leaders.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the species}} of Marginatae {{associated}} with willow, five (I.salicis-herbaceae, I.substellata, I.praetervisa, I.salicis and I.mixtilis) {{can be readily}} distinguished from I.saliceticola as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: I.mixtilis and I.praetervisa favour willow only in montane habitats, while I.salicis-herbaceae and I.substellata grow exclusively in montane habitats. I.salicis is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from dunes. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of I.dunensis are distinctly larger <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different shape to those of I.saliceticola, and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, {{and has not been}} recorded in Finland. I.obtusiuscula also has larger spores of a different shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. Phylogenetic analysis of the respective internal transcribed spacer sequences has confirmed that I.obtusiuscula and I.saliceticola are separate species.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
