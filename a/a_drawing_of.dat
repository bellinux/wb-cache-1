5|$|Confusion arose when {{an issue}} of the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion of}} the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not have been at the affair or he had reproduced <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the wrong flag.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the animal.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{the events}} of the episode never occurred, and Walter, having time to {{contemplate}} the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case, tosses it into the fireplace.

5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, {{but it became}} more of a museum from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle's south tower and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> a ship dated to around 1700.|$|E

The album cover was {{designed}} by Moshe Brakha, {{who had worked with}} the Rolling Stones to yield the Black and Blue (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. The back cover of the album was <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> a bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band's logo.|$|E

50|$|The current {{bridge is}} the fourth {{railroad}} span in the same location, originally known as Naugatuck Junction. The original bridge was the first railroad bridge over the Housatonic river, built by the New York and New Haven Railroad, and was a single-track wooden Covered Howe Truss, 1,293 feet in length and <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> 134 feet, built in 1848. It held {{the distinction of being}} the longest covered bridge ever built in the state of Connecticut. The second bridge was a double-track cast iron Whipple truss, 1,091 feet in length and <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> 206 feet, built in 1872 by the Keystone Bridge Company for the New York and New Haven Railroad. The third bridge was a double-track wrought iron Pratt truss, 1,091 feet in length and <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> 206 feet, built in 1884 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The current bridge, a four-track steel with Warren through truss spans, Scherzer Bascule bridge, 1,072 feet in length and <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> 110 feet, was completed in 1906 by the American Bridge Company for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.|$|R

5|$|Back {{in present-day}} Washington D.C., Scully brings to Mulder's {{attention}} news about a body found in New Jersey with its arm and shoulder missing. Upon {{arriving at the}} Atlantic City morgue, Scully and Mulder discover that the body was eaten by a human. However, the local detective, Thompson, denies the agents access to the investigation. Scully returns to Washington to attend her godson's birthday party, while Mulder stays in New Jersey. At the party, Scully meets Rob, the divorced father {{of one of the}} guests. Meanwhile, Mulder questions homeless people about the case. A man shows him <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> a humanoid and tells him that he saw it and that the other homeless people and cops know about it. Mulder gives his hotel room key to the man and sleeps in the alley, where he sees a shadowy, human-like creature. He chases the creature, but is arrested before he can catch it.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a number of small posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Coggins's {{interest}} in sailing and maritime subjects began in London {{when he would}} sail model yachts on Round Pond in Kensington Gardens. This interest developed into a lifelong passion during his teens when he sailed small craft on Hempstead Harbor, near his new home on Long Island. During {{the early years of}} World War II, Coggins took a sampling of his war illustrations to Worthen Paxton, the art director of LIFE Magazine, who commissioned Coggins to produce <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> an imaginary coastal invasion of England. Coggins was paid $250 for that work, a large sum at the time, which paid his rent for five months. Appearing on July 15, 1940, this was the first of many war time illustrations for LIFE. Some of Coggins's works are in the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection.|$|E

5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E
5|$|On Dell and Toshiba laptops, {{the port}} is {{marked with the}} {{standard}} USB symbol with an added lightning bolt icon on the right side. Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> a battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (putting it into sleep mode) and have the device continue to charge.|$|E
50|$|If {{the teams}} still {{remained}} tied, goal difference {{will become a}} factor. A one-game playoff would be implemented in case the teams are still tied. <b>A</b> <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> lots was to become the last solution to breaking a tie. Controversially, Independiente Santa Fe and Jorge Wilstermann tied on points which would have required a playoff; CONMEBOL, however, scrapped the idea and decided that the last semifinal slot was to be given by <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> lots which the Colombians won.|$|R

5|$|The {{settlements}} of Hale and Hale Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} Hale Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant Hale. During this era the land around Hale and Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{extensively}} {{documented in the}} colonial era. Francisco Ximénez, who first revealed the K'iche' epic Popul Vuh to the world, visited Q'umarkaj in {{the final years of}} the 17th century. Miguel Rivera y Maestre wrote a report of the site for the government of Guatemala in 1834. In 1840 John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood paid a brief visit to the site after reading Rivera y Maestre's report, and Catherwood mapped the site and produced <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the Temple of Tohil. In 1865, the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Q'umarkaj, although the maps have since been lost. A more detailed survey of the site was made by Alfred P. Maudslay in 1887, being published between 1889 and 1902. Archeological excavations were carried out in the 1950s and the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> {{straight}}-line <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{planar graph}} G is <b>a</b> planar <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> G such that each vertex is mapped {{to a point}} on the Euclidean plane, each edge is <b>drawn</b> as <b>a</b> straight line segment, and no two edges intersect except possibly at a common endpoint. A segment in <b>a</b> straight-line <b>drawing</b> is <b>a</b> maximal set of edges that form a straight line segment. <b>A</b> k-segment <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> G is <b>a</b> straight-line <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> G such {{that the number of}} segments is at most k. A plane graph is a fixed planar embedding of a planar graph. In this paper we prove that it is NP-hard to determine whether a plane graph G with maximum degree four has <b>a</b> k-segment <b>drawing,</b> where k ≥ 3. The problem remains NP-hard when the drawing is constrained to be convex. We also prove that given <b>a</b> partial <b>drawing</b> Γ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plane graph G, it is NP-hard to determine whether there exists <b>a</b> k-segment <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> G that contains all the segments specified in Γ, even when G is outerplanar.
