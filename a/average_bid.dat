Using a structural estimation approach, we find a close correspondence between the theoretical predictions of those models and experimental behavior. The basic pattern of <b>average</b> <b>bids</b> in the data consists of a combination of overbidding for low signals, and value-bidding for higher signals. The logit QRE model with heterogeneous bidders fits this pattern reasonably well. Combining quantal response with either cursed beliefs (CE-QRE) or a level-k of strategic sophistication (LK-QRE, CH-QRE) leads to a close match with the data. All these variations on quantal response models predict minimal differences of <b>average</b> <b>bidding</b> behavior across different versions of the game, consistent with the experimental findings. Finally, we reanalyze data from an earlier experiment on the same auction by Ivanov, Levin and Niederle (2010). While their data exhibit much more variance compared with ours, nonetheless, we still find that these models also fit their data reasonably well, even in the presence of extreme overbidding observed in that experiment.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The first part uses economic experiments to investigate how participants choose to divide a surplus {{in the presence of}} competing focal points. The second part examines whether a monetary policy shock has asymmetric regional effects. Chapter 2 suggests a simple separation mechanism based on heterogeneity among subjects to understand how they choose equilibrium when there are competing focal points. In a Nash demand game where buyers and sellers bargain for a liter of milk, we find that some subjects choose to split the available surplus equally while others are sensitive to the frame and therefore choose the prevailing market price of the product. The choice of focal point seems to depend on subjectsâ€™ characteristics and how strong the frame is for the subject. Chapter 3 examines whether the focal point induced by a product is sensitive to experience. In a repeated Nash demand game where buyers and sellers bargain for a coca-cola, I find that a small difference in feedback affects whether <b>average</b> <b>bids</b> converge to equal-splits. When both parties can observe the opponentâ€™s bid after each period, <b>average</b> <b>bids</b> do converge to equal-splits, but when the seller only learns if a transaction has taken place or not, <b>average</b> <b>bids</b> do not converge. Instead, around half of the subjects in this treatment stick to the prevailing market price of the product. This result remains when these sellers get to observe the buyerâ€™s bid. The repeated choice of focal point is also affected by individual characteristics and how attached subjects are to the product. Chapter 4 investigates the effects on employment in 21 Swedish regions of a monetary policy shock using a VAR model with exogenous foreign variables for the 1993 : 1 - 2007 : 4 period. The regional impulse responses clearly indicate asymmetric effects in which employment falls significantly in some regions, while not changing significantly in others. These differences seem to stem from the interest and exchange rate channel, whereby regions with larger shares of employment in the goods sector and higher export intensity are adversely affected. In addition, there is one group of regions that, surprisingly, see increased employment in response to the same policy shock...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates an <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction, {{in which}} the bid closest to the average wins the auction. In the first study, I investigate the equilibrium bidding strategy in the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction, when cost constitutes a private value without the winner?s curse. More specifically, {{in addition to the}} pooling equilibrium established by the existing literature, I characterize a partially pooling equilibrium with three bidders, {{in which the}} bid function is constant for small cost realizations and strictly increasing in cost for high cost realizations. Moreover, complete necessary conditions for the existence of partially pooling equilibrium are provided in the case of more than three bidders. Lastly, unlike the first price auction, the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction loses efficiency, and the buyer is likely to pay the more compared to first price auction. The second study investigates the characterization of the equilibrium bid function with three bidders in the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction, considering the possibility of cost overrun and penalty. When the penalty is zero, every bidder bids an identical amount. If the penalty is large, either some bidders bid identically and the rest of bidders follow a strictly increasing bidding strategy, or all bidders place an identical bid. Finally, I compare the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction with the first price reverse auction from the buyer?s point of view. If the penalty is not imposed on insolvent bidders, the buyer who chooses the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction could be better off. On the other hand, if the penalty is large enough to prevent all bidders from defaulting, the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> auction is always worse.

40|$|The low bid {{method is}} the most {{frequently}} used competitive bidding method in the construction industry. However, its main disadvantage is awarding projects to irresponsive extremely low bids which leads to disputes and claims between the owner and the contractor. To remedy this issue, some countries use the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> method which awards the job to the contractor who submits the closest bid to the average of all submitted bids. A comparison between Friedman's low bid method and the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> method was conducted by Ioannou and Leu (1993), and showed mat although the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> method protects the owner against extremely low bids, it does not promote fierce competition {{as is the case in}} a low bid awarding system.

40|$|When bids do not {{represent}} binding commitments, {{the use of a}} first price sealed bid auction favors those bidders who are less penalized from reneging on their bids. These bidders are the most likely to win but also the most likely to default on their bid.

40|$|Abstract: Bidding and {{determining}} the optimum markup {{are two major}} decisions that a contractor has to think about thoroughly {{when faced with a}} new project. Several bidding models have been presented in the literature to help contractors make these two decisions; however, they mostly considered the perspective of one contractor bidding on a single project, obscuring the interaction and learning components among contractors and the observation of emergent bidding patterns at both individual and aggregate levels. This research uses an evolutionary approach to model construction-bidding market dynamics and study the effect of contractorsâ€™ risk attitude on their markups, and on the longterm progression of bid prices under two bid-tendering approaches, namely the low and <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> methods. Simulation results showed that the most risk-tolerant contractors submit the lowest bid prices under the low-bid method and the highest prices under the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> method. Moreover, the low-bid approach revealed long-term equilibrium in tendered prices whereas the <b>average</b> <b>bid</b> method reflected a gradual bidprice increase. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} regret-related feedback information on bidding behavior in sealed-bid first-price auctions. Two types of regret are possible in this auction format. A winner of the auction may regret paying too much relative to the second highest bid, and a loser may regret missing an opportunity to win at a favorable price. In theory, under very general conditions, being sensitive to winning and paying too much should result in lower <b>average</b> <b>bids,</b> and being sensitive to missing opportunities to win at a favorable price should result in higher bids. For example, the U. S. Government's policy of revealing losing bids may cause regret-sensitive bidders to anticipate regret and bid conservatively, decreasing the government's revenue. We test these predictions in the laboratory and find strong support for both. auctions, competitive bidding, regret, learning, experimental economics...|$|R

We show theoretically and experimentally that a trade-off exists between dominant-strategy implementation and externality-robust implementation.
