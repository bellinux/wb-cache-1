25|$|BYU {{would start}} {{the second half}} with the ball but once again the Wisconsin defense would force a three–and–out. After a nice punt return by Kenzel Doe, the Badgers would start the drive at the Cougars 23-yard line. The BYU defense would hold the Badgers to a 26-yard field goal and giving Wisconsin a 20–3 lead. The Cougars would <b>answer</b> <b>right</b> back quick 6–play drive capped by a 34-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Cody Hoffman from QB Taysom Hill. A couple of stalled drive by both teams but Wisconsin would get the ball at their own 8-yard line after a 73-yard punt by BYU and were moving the ball into BYU territory as their quarter came to an end. The Badgers would score just over a minute into the fourth quarter on a 14-yard touchdown run by James White giving the Badgers a 27–10 lead. The next four drive (two by each team) would all result in punts. BYU would score after a 9–play 57 yard drive capped by a 5-yard touchdown pass to Cody Hoffman from Taysom Hill. BYU then forced the Badgers to punt and the Cougars would get the ball back with 2:12 {{left in the game}} and down by 10 points. BYU got down to the Wisconsin 25-yard line but ran out of time, Wisconsin won 27–17.|$|E
500|$|Jason {{has been}} {{referenced}} or parodied in other films. In the film Scream, directed by Freddy Krueger creator Wes Craven, actress Drew Barrymore's character is being stalked by a killer who calls {{her on her}} home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man's trivia questions. One question is [...] "name the killer in Friday the 13th." [...] She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until Part 2. Writer Kevin Williamson claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he asked this question in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, because nobody got the <b>answer</b> <b>right.</b> In another Wes Craven film, Cursed, a wax sculpture of Jason, from Jason Goes to Hell, {{can be seen in}} a wax museum. [...] In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial [...] "The '80s Called".|$|E
500|$|Although the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] skit and {{the scenes}} {{in which it was}} {{prepared}} were all scripted, Carell and Ryan improvised several of the moments including Michael's [...] "Yay!" [...] cheer upon getting an <b>answer</b> <b>right,</b> the bow Carell and Ryan take at the end while the Buffalo branch employees are angry, and Michael's Indian accent. Carell improvised with several different accents on the set, with the producers settling on the one that sounded most like the character from the film, although he used his regular accent when answering the final question in the skit. Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ("Dunder...Dunder...") while filming, and Carell made up the subsequent line [...] "We're circling it" [...] about their good sketch idea. The extras were told not to laugh or react at all to the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] sketch, but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions {{in order to create a}} genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2006. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 65). E-learning {{is the use of}} technologies to deliver lessons. It is an interactive instructional experience in which the student and the teacher are in separate physical locations. We have generated an E-learning engine or template for the teachers to enable the students to learn the lessons through incremental thinking questions chosen by the teachers in their absence. By using our software tool, interfaces will be generated automatically lesson by lesson after getting all required information from the teachers. Each question will be case (background text) based, so that the students can {{be able to get the}} <b>answers</b> <b>right</b> without being taught the topics by the teachers. The students will get feedback immediately through hints and guide to <b>right</b> <b>answers.</b> If they are unable to give the <b>right</b> <b>answers,</b> then they can get to know how to get the <b>answers</b> <b>right</b> through guide to <b>right</b> <b>answers.</b> If they give the wrong answers, then the system will give them the hints through messages for making them able to get the <b>answers</b> <b>right.</b> The students will be able to evaluate themselves through this tool after knowing their scores. They will also get to know how much they are prepared or how much they should be. Parvez AhmadTania IslamB. Computer Science and Engineerin...|$|R

500|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of A Minor with a time {{signature}} in common time. Jackson's vocal range spans from G3 to C6. The track has a tempo of 114 beats per minute. [...] "Bad" [...] {{was viewed as a}} rived [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] progression. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented on the track's lyrical content while reviewing Bad, [...] "When Jackson declares that 'the whole world has to <b>answer</b> <b>right</b> now,' he is not boasting but making a statement of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare." [...] Sigerson compared the track to material by James Brown, whose [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song. Lyrically, [...] "Bad" [...] pertains to proving to people that you are tough boasting, with Jackson asking [...] "who's bad?" [...] in a repeating lyric in the song's chorus.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR SISTER,-I mailed {{a letter}} to you and Ma this morning, but since then I have {{received}} yours to Orion and me. Therefore, I must <b>answer</b> <b>right</b> away, else I may leave town without doing it at all. What in thunder are pilot's wages to me? which question, I beg humbly to observe, is of a general nature, and not discharged particularly at you. But it is singular, isn't it, that such a matter should interest Orion, when it is of no earthly consequence to me? I never have once thought of returning home {{to go on the}} river again, and I never expect to do any more piloting at any price. My livelihood must be made in this country--and if I have to wait longer than I expected, let it be so--I have no fear of failure. You know I have extravagant hopes, for Orion tells you everything which he ought to keep to himself--but it's his nature to do that sort of thing, and I let him alone. I did think for awhile of going home this fall--but when I found that that was and had been the cherished intention and the darling aspiration every year, of these old care-worn Californians for twelve weary years--I felt a little uncomfortable, but I stole a march on Disappointment and said I would not go home this fall. I will spend the winter in San Francisco, if possible. Do not tell any one that I had any idea of piloting again at present--for it is all a mistake. This country suits me, and--it shall suit me, whether or no....|$|E
