5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the space {{velocity of the}} star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, {{it has been found}} that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E

5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E

25|$|Some {{ecological}} economists prioritise adding {{natural capital}} {{to the typical}} capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle.|$|E

25|$|The French {{title of}} this section has been {{retained}} in translation from the French Wikipedia page because the apparently corresponding term in English has {{not quite the same}} meaning.

25|$|Infanticide {{avoidance}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} reason animals, like mammals, <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to choose polyandry. Infanticide is observed to be the major cause of mortality in various mammals. Polyandry is thought to evolve from their offspring's vulnerability to infanticide. There is evidence that polyandry is an effective strategy that is adapted by many to increase their offspring survival through the avoidance of male infanticide. Bank voles (Myodes glareolus) has supported the infanticide avoidance hypothesis where polyandrous females' offspring have a higher survival than monandrous females' offspring.|$|E

25|$|It {{is alleged}} by some that the Duke of Brunswick was well-inclined {{to enter into}} the views of the Pope, but that he found he could neither raise men nor money {{sufficient}} to warrant even a probability of success. This we <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to doubt, for had Otho been ambitious, he might have obtained the empire without much difficulty; and supported as he was by England and Denmark, it is not likely that he could have been at a loss for an army, or for the means of supporting it.|$|E
25|$|Continuity {{theory is}} the view that in ageing people <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to maintain, {{as much as they}} can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have {{developed}} in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between {{the past and the present}} and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} generally {{rejects the}} view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological economists <b>are</b> <b>inclined</b> to acknowledge {{that much of what}} is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.|$|E
