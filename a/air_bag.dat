25|$|An <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one {{on the passenger side}} as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the passenger side, the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{released}} a coupé {{version of the}} Camry in 1993, for the 1994 model year with styling {{very similar to the}} four-door version, stimulating modest sales. This vehicle would be dropped for the next generation and replaced by the Camry Solara. Also in this year, the 3VZ-FE V6 departed in favour of the new aluminium 1MZ-FE V6. This new engine coincided with the standard fitment of dual front air bags, whereas the 1991 to 1993 Camrys only has driver's <b>air</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Europe, only 1152 {{examples}} of this model were sold through the official Mazda network. Only one spec was available and it included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins {{in place of the}} back seats. It also has the stiffer suspension and strut braces from the R models. Germany top the sales with 446 cars, while UK is second at 210 and Greece third with 168. The European models also received the 1994 interior facelift, with a passenger <b>air</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the {{relatively}} short production {{period of the}} FTO there were original equipment catalogues {{of a host of}} options made available. Many items were cosmetic in nature, such as stickers or chromed goods, although more substantial styling pieces such as side skirts and spoilers were also available. Practical items such as a passenger <b>air</b> <b>bag,</b> installed in the dashboard above the glove box, or ski-racks were also listed. There were also special 15 and 16inch PIAA alloy wheels. Strut braces, as found standard on the GP Version R for example and machine-stamped 'RalliArt', were also available via the Mitsubishi association with the Ralliart franchise.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Martin Eberhard was {{replaced}} by an interim CEO, Michael Marks. Marks accepted the temporary position while a recruitment was undertaken. In December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became the CEO and President of Tesla. In October 2008, Musk succeeded Drori as CEO. Drori became Vice Chairman and left the company in December. In January 2008, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{announced that it would}} grant a waiver of the advanced <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> rule noting that the Tesla Roadster already includes standard air bags; similar waivers have been granted to many other small volume manufacturers as well, including Lotus, Ferrari, and Bugatti. Tesla delivered its first production car in February 2008 to Musk.|$|E
40|$|Side <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> a {{relatively}} new technology {{designed to protect the}} head and/or torso in side-impact collisions, are becoming increasingly common in automobiles. Their efficacy in preventing US driver deaths among cars struck on the near (driver’s) side was examined using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the General Estimates System. Risk ratios for driver death per nearside collision during 1999 – 2001 were computed for head/torso and torso-only side <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> in cars from model years 1997 – 2002, relative to cars without side <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Confounding was addressed by adjusting nearside risk ratios for front- and rear-impact mortality, which is unaffected by side <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Risk ratios were 0. 55 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 43, 0. 71) for head/torso <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> and 0. 89 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 79, 1. 01) for torso-only <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Risk was reduced when cars with head/ torso <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> were struck by cars/minivans (significant) or pickup trucks/sport utility vehicles (nonsignificant). Risk was reduced in two-vehicle collisions and among male drivers and drivers aged 16 – 64 years. Protective effects associated with torso-only <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> were observed in single-vehicle crashes and among male and 16 - to 64 -year-old drivers. Head/torso side <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> appear to be very effective in reducing nearside driver deaths, whereas torso-only <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> appear less protective. accidents, traffic; air bags; automobiles; mortality; safety; vehicles Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; FARS, Fatality Analysis Reporting System; GES, General Estimates System; RR, ris...|$|R

50|$|The United States Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 {{required}} {{passenger cars}} {{and light trucks}} built after 1 September 1998 to have <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> for the driver and the right front passenger. In the United States, NHTSA estimated that <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> had saved over 4,600 lives by 1 September 1999; however, the crash deployment experience of the early 1990s installations indicated that some fatalities and serious injuries were in fact caused by <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> In 1998, NHTSA initiated new rules for advanced <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> that gave automakers more flexibility in devising effective technological solutions. The revised rules also required improved protection for occupants of different sizes regardless of whether they use seat belts, while minimizing the risk to infants, children, and other occupants caused by <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} Grand Cherokee {{was launched}} in 1992 as a 1993 model year vehicle in the luxury SUV segment. The [...] "ZJ" [...] models, manufactured from 1992 to 1998, originally came in three trim levels: base (also known as SE), Laredo, and Limited, subsequent trims were added, included Orvis (95–98), TSI (97–98). The base model included features such as full instrumentation, cloth interior, and a standard five-speed manual transmission, while gaining the moniker [...] "SE" [...] name for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> (starting in 96) and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power door locks, cruise control, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke alloy wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring body color lower body paneling, and gold exterior accents. The Limited also boasted standard features such as leather seating, heated mirrors, front power seats, a keyless entry system, wood grain interior appliqué, lace style alloy wheels, a driver information center with compass, digitized climate control, and electrochromic rearview mirror, and Jensen brand stereo with multi-band equalizer. By 1996 the option list grew to include heated seats. Standard was the 4.0, with the 5.2 V8 (and 5.9 in 1998) being optional. As with other models.
