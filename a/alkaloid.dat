5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first <b>alkaloid</b> {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine <b>alkaloid</b> ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The <b>alkaloid</b> profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E
50|$|Indole <b>alkaloids</b> are a {{class of}} <b>alkaloids</b> {{containing}} a structural moiety of indole; many indole <b>alkaloids</b> also include isoprene groups and are thus called terpene indole or secologanin tryptamine <b>alkaloids.</b> Containing more than 4100 known different compounds, {{it is one of}} the largest classes of <b>alkaloids.</b> Many of them possess significant physiological activity and some of them are used in medicine. The amino acid tryptophan is the biochemical precursor of indole <b>alkaloids.</b>|$|R
40|$|According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015, only {{processed}} Aconitum tubers can be clinically applied, and {{the effect}} of processing is unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of processing on cardiac efficacy of <b>alkaloids</b> in Aconitum tubers. First, the chemical ingredients in unprocessed and processed Aconitum tubers were identified and compared by using high performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF/MS) and multivariate pattern recognition methods. Then the representative <b>alkaloids</b> in Aconitum tubers, aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine, which belong to diester-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids,</b> monoester-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids,</b> and amine-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids,</b> respectively, were selected for further validation of attenuated mechanism. Subsequent pharmacological experiments with aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine in SD rats were used for validate the effect of processing on cardiac functions. After processing the Aconitum tubers, {{it was found that the}} contents of diester-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids</b> were reduced, and those of monoester-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids</b> and amine-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids</b> were increased, suggesting that diester-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids</b> were transformed into monoester-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids</b> and amine-diterpenoid <b>alkaloids.</b> Through further decocting the aconitine in boiling water, it was confirmed that the three <b>alkaloids</b> could be progressively transformed. Pharmacological experiments with aconitine, benzoylaconine, and aconine in SD rats showed that aconitine at a dose of 0. 01  mg/kg and aconine at a dose of 10  mg/kg enhanced the cardiac function, while benzoylaconine at a dose of 2  mg/kg weakened the cardiac function.

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine <b>alkaloid,</b> were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction.

5|$|<b>Alkaloids</b> {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known <b>alkaloids</b> exist, {{examples}} include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. <b>Alkaloids</b> have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some <b>alkaloids</b> can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain <b>alkaloids</b> bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. <b>Alkaloids</b> can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although <b>alkaloids</b> act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|R
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes.

5|$|The city {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} food processing, textile, printing and metal processing. In 2012, it accounted for 30% of the city GDP. Most of the industrial areas are located in Gazi Baba municipality, on the major routes and rail lines to Belgrade and Thessaloniki. Notably, the ArcelorMittal and Makstil steel plants are located there, and also the Skopje Brewery. Other zones are located between Aerodrom and Kisela Voda, along the railway to Greece. These zones comprise <b>Alkaloid</b> Skopje (pharmaceuticals), Rade Končar (electrical supplies), Imperial Tobacco, and Ohis (fertilisers). Two special economic zones also exist, around the airport and the Okta refinery. They have attracted several foreign companies, such as Johnson Controls, Johnson Matthey and Van Hool.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of <b>alkaloid</b> in the stem of N. papyraceus than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E

However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the <b>alkaloid</b> scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Several unique {{chemicals}} {{are produced by}} Mycena haematopus. The primary pigment is haematopodinB, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of pyrrole and quinoline, both heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities. Additional <b>alkaloid</b> compounds in M.haematopus include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior {{to the discovery of}} these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the <b>alkaloid</b> coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

The present paper summarizes the occurrence of <b>alkaloids</b> in the food chain, their mode of action and possible adverse effects including a safety assessment. Pyrrolizidine <b>alkaloids</b> are a reason for concern because of their bioactivation to reactive alkylating intermediates.
