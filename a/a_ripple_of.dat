500|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} {{under the}} influence of Agnes caused more than <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>of</b> scandal in the aristocratic circles of the Holy Roman Empire. [...] Descended as he was from the hereditary seneschals of Waldburg, Gebhard came from a line of stalwart Catholic defenders of what was considered the universal faith. One of his uncles was the bishop of Augsburg; his grandfather's brother had been a general in the German Peasants' War of 1525 and instrumental in the destruction of the German Peasant army. The family had been long-time supporters of Habsburg dynastic aspirations and policies, and key advisers for in the often-troubled Imperial relationships with the Swabian Imperial circle (Kreis). [...] Gebhard himself had been raised in a Catholic tradition, and strongly influenced by the Jesuits in his education. His career had been solely focused on obtaining a preferential position in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and his election as the archbishop of Cologne, in a close contest with the equally-qualified Wittelsbach candidate, attested not to the diligence and application of his personal faith, but his family's Imperial influence.|$|E

[...] ("The Guard retreats. Save {{yourself}} if you can!"). Wellington then stood up in Copenhagen's stirrups, and waved his hat {{in the air to}} signal an advance of the Allied line just as the Prussians were overrunning the French positions to the east. What remained of the French army then abandoned the field in disorder. Wellington and Blücher met at the inn of La Belle Alliance, on the north-south road which bisected the battlefield, and it was agreed that the Prussians should pursue the retreating French army back to France. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815.|$|E

Ripple effect cancellations spread across the entire East Coast. By the afternoon of January23, more than 10,100flights were cancelled across the country, affecting well over 100,000travelers. Nearly 2,000 more flights were delayed. Most airports in the Mid-Atlantic region suspended service altogether, with Baltimore–Washington International, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National, and Washington Dulles International closed through the evening of January24. Flights to and from LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy International, and Newark Liberty International were largely cancelled as well.
