5000|$|Although most of Australia is {{semi-arid}} or desert, {{it includes}} a diverse range of habitats from <b>alpine</b> <b>heaths</b> to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as a megadiverse country. Fungi typify that diversity; an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have been described—occur in Australia. Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.

40|$|Four main {{vegetation}} regions can {{be recognized}} in the Japanese archipelago : a lowland region of evergreen broad-leaved forest （Camellietea japonicae region）; a lowland-to-montane region of summergreen broad-leaved forest （Fagetea crenatae region）; various regions of subalpine needle leaved forests （Vaccinio-Piceetea region）; and small regions of <b>alpine</b> <b>heaths</b> or "tundra" plus treeline krummholz. The evergreen broad-leaved forests are generally dominated by Castanopsis cuspidata (incl. var. siebodii）, Persea thunbergii, and/or various evergreen Quercus species. The understorey contains the character species Camellia japonica as well as various other evergreen smaller trees, shrubs, and herbs. This evergreen forest vegetation has been almost completely destroyed by human settlement activities. The summergreen broad-leaved forests are generally dominated by Fagus crenata and /or other holarctic deciduous trees （e. g. Ulmus, Acer） but may also contain conifers, evergreen broad-leaved understorey species, and a conspicuous ground cover of Sasa spp., a dwarf bamboo. Various wetlands are also well developed in this reion, including raised bogs and various types of fens. The vegetation of this region has recently been clear-cut over large areas and converted to conifer plantations （Larix, Cryptmeria, Chamaecyparis）. The subalpine needle-leaved forests occur above the summergreen forests wherever the mountains rise high enough, generally within the belt 1600 - 2500 meters in central Honshu), The most important species are Abies mariesii and A. veitchii, Tsuga diversifolia, Picea jezoensis, and Larix kaempheri, with Vaccinium spp. as character species. Above the subalpine forests (generally above 2500 m in central Honshu), and on unstable sites below, occur Pinus pumil krummholz and various <b>alpine</b> meadows and <b>heaths.</b> All of these subalpine and alpine areas are currently threatened by expanding tourism. Potential natural vegetation represents the theoretical vegetation which would arise, under current conditions, if all disturbance were removed. The map of the potential natural vegetation of Japan suggests four main vegetation regions : a lowland region of evergreen broad-leaved forest （Camellietea japonicae）, a lowland-to montane region of summergreen broad-leaved forest（Fagetea crenatae）, Various regions of subalpine needle-leaved forests（Vaccinio-Piceetea）, and small regions of <b>alpine</b> <b>heaths</b> or "tundra". The Camellietea japonicae region covers roughly the southern half ofJapan, extending up the coasts further to the north, including the original coastline of Tokyo Bay. The suummergreen forest replaces the evergreen forest as winters become colder, both {{to the north and}} at higher elevations （about 700 - 1600 m in central Honshu）. The subalpine needle-leaved forests occur mainly at higher elevations （above 1600 m in central Honshu）but can descend almost to sea level on Hokkaido...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} {{strongly}} influence species distribution and, thus, {{the structure and}} function of ecosystems. This paper describes simulated changes {{in the position of}} the upper treeline in the Swedish mountains in response to predicted climate change. Data on predicted summer temperature changes, the current position of the treeline, and a digital elevation model were used to predict the position of the treeline over a 100 -year timeframe. The results show the treeline advancing upward by 233 - 667 m, depending on the climate scenario used and location within the mountain chain. Such changes hypothetically caused a 75 - 85 % reduction in treeless <b>alpine</b> <b>heaths,</b> with 60 - 93 % of the remaining areas being scree slopes and boulder fields. For this change to occur, the migration rate of the trees would be in the order of 23 - 221 m yr- 1, which is well within published migration rates for wind-dispersed deciduous trees. The remaining alpine areas would be strongly fragmented. These drastic changes would influence all aspects of mountain ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation and human land-use patterns...|$|R

Tall heaths with plants up to 2m (Orites acicularis, Leptospermum rupestre, Coprosma nitida) are usually found in areas of better drainage usually with a rock strewn surface. Low heaths (15-50+ cm), (Baeckea gunniana, Epacris serpyllifolia, Richea sprengelioides) are more frequently found on more peaty soils and frequently border wet areas.|$|E
50|$|Erris Head {{has been}} {{designated}} a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the European Union's Habitats Directive. Erris Head SAC comprises approximately 15 km of cliff plus adjoining habitats. The geology of the region consists of acid rocks, such as quartzite, gneiss and Silurian schists and slates. The sea cliffs are very exposed and subject to very high rainfall. They are of moderate height, reaching a maximum of about 90 m in the north-east and are predominantly north-facing.

40|$|Heathland {{habitats}} in Ireland occur {{primarily in}} an oceanic setting which is {{strongly influenced by}} changes in the climate. As {{a consequence of the}} oceanic environment, Ireland has a high proportion of the northern Atlantic wet and <b>alpine</b> and boreal <b>heaths</b> of high conservation value within Europe. Future climate change is widely expected to place additional pressure on these systems. Seven bioclimatic envelope modelling techniques implemented in the BIOMOD modelling framework were used to model Wet and <b>Alpine</b> and Boreal <b>heath</b> distributions in Ireland. The 1961 to 1990 baseline models closely matched the observed distribution, and emphasise the strong dependency on climate. Mean winter precipitation, mean winter temperature and elevation were found to be important model components. The fitted models discrimination ability was assessed using the area under the curve (range 0. 874 to 0. 929, Wet heath; 0. 858 to 0. 936, <b>Alpine</b> and Boreal <b>heath)</b> of a receiver operating characteristic plot; the true skill statistic (range 0. 648 to 0. 713, Wet heath; 0. 666 to 0. 737, Alpine and Boreal heath); and Cohen’s kappa (range 0. 652 to 0. 714, Wet heath; 0. 641 to 0. 738, <b>Alpine</b> and Boreal <b>heath).</b> A BIOMOD ensemble prediction from all the models was used to project changes based on a climate change scenario for 2031 to 2060 dynamically downscaled from the Hadley Centre HadCM 3 -Q 16 global climate model. The climate change projections for the individual models change markedly from the consistent baseline predictions. Projected climate space losses (gains) from the BIOMOD consensus model are - 40. 84 % (limited expansion) and - 10. 38 % (full expansion) for Wet heath; and - 18. 31 % (limited expansion) and + 28. 17 % (full expansion) for <b>Alpine</b> and Boreal <b>heath.</b> Although the consensus models project gains in climate space for both habitats {{in other parts of the}} country, new habitat formation in these areas is unlikely as current (and hence near future) land use and other conditions are not likely to favour expansion...|$|R

The N concentration and 8 ' 5 N were determined in leaves of 25 plant species from 8 functionallmycorrhizal groups from an alpine lichen heath in the Teberda Reserve, Northern Caucasus, Russia. Functional groups were represented by ericoid mycorrhizal species (ERI), ectomycorrhizal species (ECT), arbuscular mycorrhizal forbs (AM-FORB), arbuscular mycorrhizal grasses (AM- GRA), arbuscular mycorrhizal nodulated legumes (FAB-N), non-mycorrhizal graminoids (sedges and rushes) (NOM-CIRA), non-mycorrhizal hemiparasites (NOM-SP), and orchids (ORC).
