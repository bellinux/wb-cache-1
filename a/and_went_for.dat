5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E
5|$|The pay-per-view's {{main event}} was a {{standard}} {{match for the}} WWF Championship, where the champion Diesel defended the title against Sid (managed by Ted DiBiase).

5|$|The {{penultimate}} {{match on}} the card saw Eve defend the WWE Divas Championship against Maryse. Maryse took the early advantage, but when she threw Eve outside the ring, and attempted to kick her, she kicked the ringpost instead, allowing Eve to take control {{with a series of}} dropkicks. Eve performed a standing moonsault and a sunset flip for a near-fall. Maryse countered a rolling senton splash attempt by Eve <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> her finishing move, the French Kiss; that was countered by Eve for the pin, who retained her championship.|$|E
5|$|The semifinals of the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament followed, {{beginning}} with Team 3D pitted against Cage and Rhino {{in the sixth}} encounter. The bout lasted ten minutes. Before the contest, the TNA commentators announced that Booker T's attack on Cage and Rhino had caused them to have concussions in the storyline. During the contest, Team 3D associate Johnny Devine came to the ring and handed Ray a kendo stick without the referee's knowledge. Although Rhino tackled Devon <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> the cover, Devine entered the ring to distract the referee, allowing Ray to hit Rhino with the kendo stick and cover to win the contest for his team.|$|E
5|$|The semifinals {{were held}} on the September 2 episode of Impact!. Shelley and Waltman {{defeated}} the team of Hoyt and Konnan in the first semifinal match at 4 minutes and 22 seconds.

5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|Struthers {{was one of}} six children, {{three boys}} and three girls. The boys were privately tutored in the classics, {{mathematics}} and modern languages at home in Brucefield House. They went out boating in summer, skating in winter on the nearby dam; they rode ponies, went swimming in the nearby Firth of Forth, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> long walks with wealthy friends. Both his older brother James {{and his younger brother}} Alexander studied medicine. James Struthers became a doctor at Leith; Alexander Struthers died of cholera while serving as a doctor in the Crimean War. His sisters Janet and Christina provided a simple education at Brucefield for some poor friends, Daniel and James Thomson. Daniel (1833–1908) became a Dunfermline weaver as well as a historian and reformer.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF played eight matches for the season, winning {{four and}} losing the rest. Miller's top score was 141 in faster-than-even time against Public School Wanderers at Hove. He {{went on to}} play for Dominions, a {{composite}} team from the British Commonwealth, in a two-day match against England in August, scoring 32 and two and bowling a total of eight overs for 46 runs without taking a wicket. England fielded a team of almost Test standard, with six capped Test players and four others who made their debut immediately after the resumption of international cricket following the war. The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend, England batsman Denis Compton. In their first battle at the crease, Miller aimed a short ball that took off past Compton's shoulder <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> four byes. By {{the end of his}} season, Miller's bowling began to attract media attention. He ended the season in a match at Lord's between the airmen: the RAAF against the RAF. Miller took 3/23 and scored 91 in the RAAF's total of 8/164. None of the matches during the 1943 season were accorded first-class status.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronometer}} {{was returned}} to Greenwich 6 February 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing. It did not come back to Greenwich for nearly two years. On 4 March 1828 it was issued to Captain J. Bolder in command of HMS Hecla. At this time Hecla was a famous ship: {{under the command of}} George Francis Lyon she had been part of Parry's second expedition to find the Northwest Passage. Over 6,000 members of the public visited the ship at Deptford while she waited to set out on Parry's third expedition in 1824. The attempt was abandoned in 1825 after the leading ship, HMS Fury was abandoned due to ice damage. Parry used Hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach the North Pole. Parry unwillingly gave up Hecla when the admiralty sent her to survey the West African coast under the command of Bolder. In July 1830 the chronometer was returned from Hecla <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> cleaning to Robert Molyneux in London. It {{was returned to}} Greenwich in November but not immediately issued to another ship.|$|E

25|$|The {{initials}} MSA {{were well}} {{regarded as an}} airline icon, and both carriers tried to use them.
