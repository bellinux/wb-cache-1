[...] Starting in 2015, the CMP began awarding achievement pins based on the score one earns at a given match. [...] For example, to earn a bronze, silver, or gold CMP [...]22 Rimfire Pistol Achievement Pin, one must achieve a score of 235-249, 250-264, or 265+ respectively in the authorized excellence category of competition. [...] Also in 2015, the CMP established minimum cut scores that must be achieved for a given weapon in the authorized excellence category of competition before one can earn credit points (also referred to as [...] "leg points") towards a distinguished marksmanship badge. [...] Once the minimum cut score has been achieved or exceeded (260-300 for [...]22 rimfire pistol, 250-300 for service pistol, and 455-500 for service rifle), the shooter becomes eligible to earn leg points. [...] The number of leg points that can be earned are {{based on the number of}} competitors, one's score, one's ranking, and you must fall within the top 10% of all match shooters regardless of your minimum cut score. [...] Typically, the highest one-sixth of the top 10% earn ten leg points, the next highest two-sixths earn eight, and the remaining three-sixths earn six. [...] Depending on the <b>awarding</b> <b>organization,</b> competitors must earn between one and six leg points to be awarded their first excellence-in-competition badge. [...] Everyone must earn at least 30 leg points to reach [...] "distinguished status" [...] and be awarded one of the distinguished marksmanship badges. [...] Leg points accumulate throughout a competitor's lifetime until [...] "distinguished status" [...] is attained. [...] Thus, leg points earned as a member of the U.S. armed forces will transfer toward [...] "distinguished status" [...] as a civilian, and vice versa.|$|E
