2500|$|Butkus {{was drafted}} by the Bears as the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL Draft. He soon {{established}} himself as a ball hawk with his penchant for forcing turnovers. In his NFL career, he intercepted 22 passes, recovered 27 fumbles (a record when he retired), and was responsible for causing many more fumbles with his jarring tackles. His tackling ability earned him both admiration and trepidation from opposing players. According to Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, Butkus [...] "was a well-conditioned animal, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> hit you, he tried to put you in the cemetery, not the hospital." [...] In 2009, the NFL Network named Butkus the most feared tackler of all time.|$|E

For the Navy was his family, the junior {{officers}} he trained and the enlisted men who did {{so much of the}} hand-labor in the boats. He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his father, would then write about the things he'd seen and done... More than once I spoke with him about the psychological aspects of combat, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> told me what I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2005, Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman entered {{negotiations}} {{to star in}} an untitled 20th Century Fox project written by director Baz Luhrmann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie, with Luhrmann directing the film. For her role, Kidman learned to round up cattle. In May 2006, due to Crowe's demanding personal script approval before signing onto the project, Luhrmann sought to replace the actor with Heath Ledger. Crowe said he didn't {{want to work in}} an environment that was influenced by budgetary needs. About this casting issue, Luhrmann said, [...] "it was hard pinning [...] down. Every time I was ready, Russell was in something else, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was ready, I would be having another turmoil". The following June, Luhrmann replaced Crowe with actor Hugh Jackman. In January 2007, actors Bryan Brown, Jack Thompson, and David Wenham were cast into Australia. In November 2006, Luhrmann began searching for an actor to play an Aboriginal boy of 8–10 years old and by April 2007, 11-year-old Brandon Walters was cast into the role of Nullah. Academic D. Bruno Starrs has written about how this casting choice and the decision to have the character of Nullah narrate the film reinforce its [...] "left-leaning" [...] message regarding the 'Stolen Generations'.|$|E
2500|$|Figo's {{second game}} {{back at the}} Camp Nou, on 23 November 2002, {{produced}} one of the defining images of the Barcelona–Real Madrid rivalry. There {{was no sign of}} the hatred or the hurt subsiding, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> came within range of the Barcelona fans, beer cans, lighters, bottles and golf balls flew. Figo commented, [...] "I was worried that some madman might lose his head." [...] This time, Figo had decided that he would take corners, as well as throw-ins, and midway through the second half Madrid won a corner. Amid a shower of flying objects, it took Figo two minutes to take it. Another corner followed on the other side, and as Figo walked across, he slowed to pick up the missiles and as he prepared to take the corner he moved away some of the debris, while giving an ironic thumbs-up and smiling. Every time he began his run-up to take the corner, another missile would land which was repeated over and over, until the referee Luis Medina Cantalejo suspended the game for almost 20 minutes. During the break in play, the defining image of the rivalry, a pig's head, was picked up on camera, which was in among the debris near the corner flag.|$|E
