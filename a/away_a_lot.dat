According to Durst, [...] "The name is there to turn people's heads <b>away.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those {{are the people that}} we don't even want {{listening}} to our music." [...] Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name.|$|E

Day said: [...] "During this long, boring period, I used to while <b>away</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller [...] But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to Ella Fitzgerald.

2500|$|In some scenes, {{the glow}} in the pupils of replicants' eyes creates a sense of artificiality. This effect was {{produced}} by cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth shining a light along the optical axis of the camera. According to Ridley Scott, [...] "that kickback you saw from the replicants' retinas {{was a bit of}} a design flaw. I was also trying to say that the eye is really the most important organ in the human body. It's like a two-way mirror; the eye doesn't only see a lot, the eye gives <b>away</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> A glowing human retina seemed one way of stating that". He considers the glow to be a stylistic device only, but Brion James (Leon) suggests that pollution was the [...] "cause" [...] for the glow.|$|E
2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape <b>away</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh." [...] Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy [...] "restores balance" [...] to the couple when they are in conflict and represent [...] "the commoners" [...] while the couple represents [...] "nobility" [...] or [...] "the clergy." [...] MacCabe wrote that Roxy [...] "offer an image of acceptable sociality" [...] in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls [...] "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation." ...|$|E

Mr. Bunter at last opened his eyes, but he could not speak. He was dazed and inert. The steward bandaged a nasty scalp-wound while Captain Johns held an additional light.
