25|$|In October 2007, McTell {{released}} an 'audio book' titled <b>As</b> <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Can Tell. The three CDs included readings from the autobiography interspersed with new {{recordings of the}} songs they inspired. The <b>As</b> <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Can Tell treble CD was promoted by a tour that included a concert at St Mary’s church in Banbury, a location that featured in {{the first volume of}} autobiography.|$|E

25|$|During 2008, McTell {{combined}} the two volumes of his autobiography {{into a single}} volume under the title <b>As</b> <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Can Tell for publication to coincide with his autumn tour.

I feel I have taken the club <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can, {{and that it would}} be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} word geldi, the unmarked suffix -di {{indicates}} past tense. In the second word gelmiş, the suffix -miş also indicates past tense but indirectly. It may be translated into English with the added words obviously, apparently or <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> understand. The direct past tense marker -di is unmarked (or neutral) {{in the sense that}} whether or not evidence exists supporting the statement is not specified.|$|E

25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|After their Defeat the Rebels {{retired to}} the Isle aux Noix, where they {{continued}} till lately, sending out some Parties, and many Emissaries, to debauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians, {{in which they}} have proved too successful, and for which they were too well prepared by the Cabals and Intrigues of these two last years; We knew of their being reinforced, and very considerably, I suppose, as they appeared in Numbers near St. John's last Sunday Evening; where or when they landed, or the Particulars since, we have but very imperfect Accounts of, all Communications with the Forts of St. John's and Chambli, being, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can find, entirely cut off.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|A {{month after}} resigning from the {{national}} scene, Southall returned to management with Hastings United. However just one year on he was sacked, with the Hastings chairman saying that [...] "there have recently been {{an increasing number of}} issues on which Neville and I have disagreed and it had {{got to the point where}} our working relationship had broken down, beyond the point of repair, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was concerned".|$|E
500|$|Simon Hopkinson, {{writing in}} The Independent in 2000, praises Acton's Christmas pudding: [...] "It {{was to the}} cookery writing of the legendary Eliza Acton where Joyce Molyneux [...] went to find her perfect pudding recipe. And, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember, the {{particular}} reason why she liked the result of Acton's recipe above all others was because it had this unusual lightness to it, yet also seemed to offer up the required richness too." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{name of the}} magazine, [...] "Lobster", has {{attracted}} multiple interpretations. Dorril recalls that [...] "We wanted the magazine to sound not pompous, and as a teenager, he would invent names for punk rock groups. 'Lobster' {{was just one of}} his favourites." [...] Ramsay recalls that [...] "The name [...] "Lobster" [...] was Steve Dorril's choice. I couldn't think of an alternative and I didn't think the name mattered. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know it had no connotations for Dorril; indeed as I remembered it, the absence of connotations was part of is appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 28, 2014, Simon & Schuster {{published}} a massive 960 page, thirteen {{and a half}} pound edition of Dylan's lyrics, The Lyrics: Since 1962. The book was edited by literary critic Christopher Ricks, Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow, to offer variant versions of Dylan's songs, sourced from out-takes and live performances. A limited edition of 50 books, signed by Dylan, was priced at $5,000. [...] "It’s the biggest, most expensive book we’ve ever published, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know," [...] said Jonathan Karp, Simon & Schuster’s president and publisher.|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent {{resigned}} {{as leader of}} the Liberal Party on September 5, 1957, but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected. With a lame-duck leader, the Liberals were ineffective in opposition. Paul Martin stated that [...] "I'm sure I never thought the day would come when [...] would ever be a member of a government, let alone head of it. When that happened, the world had come to an end <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was concerned." [...] In January 1958, St. Laurent was succeeded by Lester Pearson.|$|E

500|$|The expedition's {{other main}} accomplishments {{included}} the first ascent of Mount Erebus, {{and the discovery}} of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, reached on 16 January 1909 by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson, and Alistair Mackay. Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his expedition account, Heart of the Antarctic. Emily Shackleton later recorded: [...] "The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole was 'a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am concerned'".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, she {{starred in}} the home {{invasion}} horror film The Strangers with Scott Speedman, a film about a young couple who are terrorized one night by three masked assailants in their remote country house. Although the film garnered a mixed reception among critics, {{it was a major}} box office success, earning over $80 million over its considerably smaller $9 million budget. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she noted that The Strangers was the most challenging role of her career. [...] "It was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could push myself in every way: physically, emotionally, mentally." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Illegal" [...] is a ballad with lyrics {{revolving}} around mourning {{for the loss}} of a lover, as seen in the lines, [...] "It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart". It contains elements of pop and country music. Spence D. of the website IGN felt that Shakira adopted an [...] "almost modern day country-styled pop aesthetic". Throughout the song, her vocals are subdued, complete with [...] "rolling delivering, breathy accentuations, and... trill". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the lyrics [...] "You said you would love me until you died/And <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know you're still alive" [...] were similar to Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] (1995).|$|E
