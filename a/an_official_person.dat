He was answered by the natives according to their usual mode of expression, that the moon was in her dark side, {{and that he was}} not to hope to behold her bursting through a cloud to illuminate the thickets and strata of black and slaty rocks, amongst which they were winding. Hartley had therefore no resource, save to keep his eye steadily fixed on the lighted match of the Sowar, or horseman, who rode before him, which, for sufficient reasons, was always kept in readiness to be applied to the priming of the matchlock. The vidette, on his part, kept a watchful eye on the Dowrah, a guide supplied at the last village, who, having got more than halfway from his own house, was much to be suspected of meditating how to escape the trouble of going further. [Footnote: In every village the Dowrah, or Guide, is <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>person,</b> upon the public establishment, and receives a portion of the harvest or other revenue, along with the Smith, the Sweeper, and the Barber.

6000|$|Once more {{upon the}} road without an aim, the {{wanderer}} turned to Augsburg, {{simply as the}} nearest city, and—set up a Newspaper! The Deutsche Chronik flourished in his hands; {{in a little while}} it had acquired a decided character for sprightliness and talent; in time it became the most widely circulated journal of the country. Schubart was again a prosperous man: his writings, stamped with the vigorous impress of his own genius, travelled over Europe; artists and men of letters gathered round him; he had money, he had fame; the rich and noble threw their parlours open to him, and listened with delight to his overflowing, many-coloured conversation. He wrote paragraphs and poetry; he taught music and gave concerts; he set up a spouting establishment, recited newly-published poems, read Klopstock's Messias to crowded and enraptured audiences. Schubart's evil genius seemed asleep, but Schubart himself awoke it. He had borne a grudge against the clergy, ever since his banishment from Ludwigsburg; and he now employed the facilities of his journal for giving vent to it. He criticised the priesthood of Augsburg; speculated on their selfishness and cant, and took every opportunity of turning them and their proceedings into ridicule. The Jesuits especially, whom he regarded as a fallen body, he treated with extreme freedom; exposing their deceptions, and holding up to public contumely certain quacks whom they patronised. The Jesuitic Beast was prostrate, but not dead: it had still strength enough to lend a dangerous kick to any one who came too near it. One evening <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>person</b> waited upon Schubart, and mentioned an arrest by virtue of a warrant from the Catholic Bürgermeister! Schubart was obliged to go to prison. The heads of the Protestant party made an effort in his favour: they procured his liberty, but not without a stipulation that he should immediately depart from Augsburg. Schubart asked to know his crime; but the Council answered him: [...] "We have our reasons; let that satisfy you:" [...] and with this very moderate satisfaction he was forced to leave their city.|$|E
6000|$|But {{neither did}} Danton shriek; though, as Minister of Justice, {{it was more}} his part to do so. Brawny Danton is in the breach, as of stormed Cities and Nations; amid the Sweep of Tenth-of-August cannon, the rustle of Prussian gallows-ropes, the smiting of September sabres; {{destruction}} all round him, and the rushing-down of worlds: Minister of Justice is his name; but Titan of the Forlorn Hope, and Enfant Perdu of the Revolution, is his quality,--and the man acts according to that. [...] "We must put our enemies in fear!" [...] Deep fear, is it not, as of its own accord, falling on our enemies? The Titan of the Forlorn Hope, {{he is not the}} man that would swiftest of all prevent its so falling. Forward, thou lost Titan of an Enfant Perdu; thou must dare, and again dare, and without end dare; there is nothing left for thee but that!

The Cause alone is great; and shall live, and not perish.--So, on the whole, here too is a swallower of Formulas; of still wider gulp than Mirabeau: this Danton, Mirabeau of the Sansculottes.

Two Thousand slain in the Prisons; horrible if you will: but Brunswick is within a day's journey of us; and there are Five-and twenty Millions yet, to slay or to save. Some men have tasks,--frightfuller than ours! It seems strange, but is not strange, that this Minister of Moloch-Justice, when any suppliant for a friend's life got access to him, was found to have human compassion; and yielded and granted 'always;' 'neither did one personal enemy of Danton perish in these days.'

5000|$|Only the {{earliest}} ones, {{which had influence}} {{on the development of}} the order, can be mentioned here. The most important is that of the Four Masters, edited at least six times in old collections of Franciscan texts, under the names of Monumenta, Speculum, Firmamenturn (Brescia, 1502; Salamanca, 1506, 1511; Rouen, 1509; Paris, 1512; Venice, 1513). The chapter of the custodes at Montpellier, 1541, had ordered that the solution of some doubts about the rule should be asked for from each province. We know of two expositions of the rule drawn up on this occasion. Eccleston (c. xii, alias xiii, Analecta Francisc., I, 244) speaks of the short but severe exposition which the friars in England sent to the general, beseeching him by the blood of Jesus Christ to let the rule stand as it was given by St. Francis. Unfortunately, the text of this declaration has not been handed down. We have, however, that of the province of Paris, issued on the same occasion by four masters of theology, Alexander of Hales, Jean de la Rochelle, Robert of Bastia, and Richard of Cornwall. The custos Godfried figures only as <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>person.</b> This interesting exposition of the rule, and the most ancient, for it was written in the spring of 1242, is short and treats only some dubious points, in conformity with the Bull [...] "Quo elongati" [...] and two later decisions of Gregory IX (1240, 1241). Their method is casuistic. They propose doubts, resolve them, and sometimes leave the questions to the superiors, or invoke a decision of the pope, although they speak twice (c. ii, ix) of the possible danger for the pure observance of the rule, if too many papal privileges are obtained. The work of the Four Masters has had the same effect on subsequent private expositions as the Bull [...] "Quo elongati" [...] had on all following pontifical declarations. The most prolific writer on the Rule of St. Francis was St. Bonaventure, who was compelled to answer fierce adversaries, such as Guillaume de Saint-Amour and others. His treatises are found in the Quaracchi edition of his works, VIII, 1898 (see SAINT BONAVENTURE). The standpoint of St. Bonaventure is observance of the rule as explained by the papal declarations and with wise accommodation to circumstances. He himself exercised great influence on the decretal [...] "Exiit" [...] of Nicholas III.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of the Soviet period of our state of course it is important to study the experience of legislation and established in the Soviet era law enforcement. In the Soviet times special attention was given to the criminal. In current article authors consider in detail bases for the techniques of designing and differentiating features of law on official (service) crimes in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of 1922. Studying the structure of the offense, authors identify obvious advantages of legal norms (primarily lack of casuistry), study features of sanctions for the offense, and as well carry out analysis of perpetrator. However, {{as a result of the}} comprehensive study, authors highlight a number of shortcomings. Authors identified several weaknesses in the definition of <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>person</b> as the subject of the crime. Authors argue that it could not affect the legal practice during the period under review. In conclusion, authors justify that the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of 1922 contained several compositions of power’s abuse concentrated in three separate articles, criminal liability which differentiated both the subjective and the objective criteria...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the forms of social undutyfulness in villages, namely the {{criminal}} act manifesting itself in preventing <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>person</b> from performing an official act (art. 289 of CC). This criminal act perturbs the maintenance of public order, unables the state organs to carry out legal verdicts and finally disrupts the principles of solidarity and interactions in local communities. Before all, the data on criminal offences and their performers are presented. Then the authors analyse {{the character of the}} official act when, in the cource of its execution, the official persons were attacked, furthermore the place, time and way of performing a criminal act, the function of official person being attacked, personality, social rank and previous criminal records of offenders, alcoholism and basic characteristics of criminal acts committed in groups. Presenting some factors that actually stimulate this kind of crime in villages, the authors particularly stressed the fact that very often its committment is acompanied by violence, possibly as an expression of usual reactions of socially maladjusted individuals living still in relative backward social and economic communities. Among other factors the authors mentioned unregulated neighbourhood relations and relatively large number of recidivists and habitual drinkers among offenders. Prevention activity should be directed to the improvement of the educational and cultural standard of the population, because it, as a rule, results in the decrease of all forms of crimes, especially those followed by violence. The creation of such public opinion in villages that would resist criminal phenomena is also of great importance. In that respect the authors attach an important function and role to the s. c. arbitrary committees already established in many villages as unofficial organs of villagers. Though the number of this kind of criminal acts, is relatively small, the authors expressed their opinion that the study of this and other similar forms of social misbehaviour is necessary and usefull for the fullier understanding of social processes going on in villages...|$|E

The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys. Readers are asked to note that, {{with the exception of the}} surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association's magazine Which? and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public. Surveys 69005 - 69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of Which? readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of Which? readers are unlikely to be typical. Main Topics : Number of different matters over which respondent has consulted a solicitor in last 5 years; whether has a regular or family solicitor; number of different solicitors used over last 5 years (if more than one used, reason given, matters for which solicitor used (18 categories); method of choice of solicitor (29 categories); whether used solicitor for legal advice only, non-legal advice only, for non-advice matters (e. g. probate), if so, frequency of use, amount paid and opinion of utility service given are recorded. Also stated is whether respondent has been represented by a solicitor in any of 9 types of court. Information also includes; opinion on amount of money that respondent has had to pay solicitor (on a 6 -point value scale), and whether respondent knew the probable cost at outset; time taken to complete legal matter (reason given if time was great), also whether respondent was satisfactorily informed as to what was going on during this time. Knowledge of statutary and voluntary legal advice schemes is tested and use made of advice under such schemes is recorded. Knowledge and use of specialist solicitors is also recorded. Data are also given on whether respondent has ever had cause to make a serious complaint against a solicitor. If yes, action s/he took (7 categories), and his/her opinion as to where the real fault lay (12 categories - e. g. system, individual solicitor etc.). Whether respondent has ever had a document signed or attested by <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>person.</b> If so, who (9 categories); opinion of ease of access to the Commissioner of Oaths and to the Notary Public (4 -point scale in each case); whether respondent has bought or sold property in last 5 years without using services of a solicitor - reason for doing so is recorded (who helped respondent with legal work is also noted).
