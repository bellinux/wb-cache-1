GAO reviewed relevant UN documents; conducted structured interviews with chief procurement officers at 20 peacekeeping missions; and interviewed UN and U. S. officials. State agreed with the report and commented that it would draw upon some of the report findings in its discussion with the United Nations.

40|$|South Africa {{is seen as}} a major {{destination}} for refugees and asylum-seekers and is, according to the 2010 Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the world’s highest destination country for asylum-seekers, mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa. Following the 1994 democratic elections, there was a transformation in foreign policy, embracing the African Agenda, and South Africa became a major country of destination because of its relative prosperity in Africa. As a State Party to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees, South Africa is under a legal obligation to protect refugees and grant them legal rights. At the same time, South African citizens, who had legitimate aspirations that the 1994 democratic government would address their development challenges, opposed the significant flow of refugees into the country by violent acts of xenophobia. The government, seen as a moral authority internationally with human rights being a key principle underpinning its foreign policy, found itself between the promotion of the African Agenda and its commitments to its own citizens. The refugee issue was addressed in the United Nations where the government made multilateral diplomacy a central platform of its foreign policy, a policy embedded in Africa and the South. South Africa is used as a case study to determine how it used multilateral diplomacy in the United Nations refugee regime through its coalition, the African Group, to address the migration issue. The study draws out the weaknesses of the international refugee regime by discussing the roles of two important diplomatic actors: the sovereign states in the United Nations General Assembly, and the international organization mandated to supervise the international refugee regime, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. South Africa’s foreign policy objective of promoting the African Agenda at times conflicts with the promotion of its national interest. Its progressive Constitution (1996) provides economic, social, and cultural rights to refugees, to the resentment of its own citizens, who view the refugees as beneficiaries of the United Nations. The study provides a critical analysis of South Africa’s multilateral diplomacy, and also provides the following recommendations where South Africa could use this mode more effectively to address the migration issue: Reform the international refugee regime; Allocate funds from the United Nations regularly <b>assessed</b> <b>budget</b> to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and, Develop an international normative regulatory framework for irregular migrants.

To effectively manage road infrastructure, firstly road agencies not {{only need to}} optimise the expenditure for data collection, {{but at the same}} time, not jeopardise the reliability in using the optimised data to predict maintenance and rehabilitation costs.

40|$|The Customer Equity and Lifetime Management (CELM) {{solution}} {{is based on}} a decision-support system that offers marketing managers a scientific framework for the optimal planning and budgeting of targeted marketing campaigns to maximize return on marketing investments. The CELM technology combines advanced models of Markov decision processes (MDPs), Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio optimization. MDPs are used to model customer dynamics and to find optimal marketing policies that maximize the value generated by a customer over a given time horizon. Lifetime value optimization is achieved through dynamic programming algorithms that identify which marketing actions, such as cross-selling, up-selling, and loyalty marketing campaigns, transition customers to better value and loyalty states. The CELM technology {{can also be used to}} simulate the financial impact of a given marketing policy using Monte Carlo simulation. This allows marketing managers to simulate several targeting scenarios to <b>assess</b> <b>budget</b> requirements and the expected impact of a given marketing policy.

40|$|University administrators {{involved}} in budget planning must trade off {{variables such as}} faculty size, faculty salary increments, tuition increases, and investment in new initiatives. TRADES is a computer-based, interactive financial model designed to assist in making trade-offs and finding preferred feasible solutions. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experiment to test the significance of preference changes resulting from the use of the TRADES model. In this experiment, 38 subjects were divided into two groups, one provided with TRADES and the other only with a printed university projected forecast. The subjects were asked to rank-order 27 different five-year financial policies. The two groups were compared using the preference function assessment technique of Srinivasan and Shocker. The policy preference changes by TRADES users were found to be significantly greater than the preference changes by nonusers. That is, the experience of using the TRADES model to <b>assess</b> <b>budget</b> policy altered the choice of preferred policy. The implication of this experiment is that the preference functions evolve as better understanding is reached of trade-offs and constraints.

Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine {{the uncertainty of the}} overhead cost rate and other parameters. The cost of developing the system was $ 328, 866. The development cost was $ 52. 79 per patient when amortized over a 7 -year period with a cohort of 1, 000 persons. About 20 % of the cost was incurred in defining the theoretic framework and supporting literature, constructing the variables and survey, and conducting focus groups. About 41 % of the cost was for developing the messages, algorithms, and constructing program elements, and the remaining cost was to create and test the computer education program. About 69 % of the cost was attributable to personnel expenses.

40|$|Although the {{implementation}} date for ICD- 10 -CM and ICD- 10 -PCS (jointly {{referred to as}} “ICD- 10 ” {{throughout the rest of}} this document) may still be several years away, it is not too early to begin planning for the transition, and even putting some of those plans in motion. A well-planned, well-managed implementation process will increase the chances of a smooth, successful transition. Experience in other countries has shown that early preparation is key to success. The best way to manage the challenges inherent in making a transition of this magnitude is to tackle them in a phased approach. Some of the preparation activities necessary for implementation provide benefits to the organization even before ICD- 10 is implemented, such as medical record documentation improvement strategies and efforts to expand coding staff knowledge and skills. Also, an early start allows for resource allocation, such as costs for systems changes and education as well as staff time devoted to implementation processes, to be spread over several years. Thus, many of the costs can be absorbed by existing annual budgets rather than requiring a large budgetary investment at one time. The following checklist and proposed phased approach to implementation were prepared to guide healthcare organizations in planning and managing the transition toward ICD- 10. Phase 1 [...] Impact Assessment The first stage of preparation involves assessing the impact of the change to new coding systems and identifying key tasks and objectives.
