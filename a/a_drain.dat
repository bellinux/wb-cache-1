5|$|By 2003 Wikipedia {{had grown}} to 100,000 {{articles}} in its English-language version, and it became difficult for Bomis to continue financially supporting the project. With Wikipedia <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> on the company's resources, Wales and Sanger decided to fund the project on a non-profit basis. Bomis laid off most of its employees to continue operating, since Wikipedia was not generating revenue. The company owned Wikipedia from its creation through 2003, and Wales used about $100,000 of Bomis' revenue to fund Wikipedia before the decision to shift the encyclopedia to non-profit status.|$|E

The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> on the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E

5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E

5|$|Bomis created Nupedia {{as a free}} online {{encyclopedia}} (with content {{submitted by}} experts) {{but it had a}} tedious, slow review process. Wikipedia was initially launched by Bomis to provide content for Nupedia, and was a for-profit venture (a Bomis subsidiary) through the end of 2002. As the costs of Wikipedia rose with its popularity, Bomis' revenues declined as result of the dot-com crash. Since Wikipedia was <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> on Bomis' resources, Wales and philosophy graduate student Larry Sanger decided to fund the project as a charity; Sanger was laid off from Bomis in 2002. Nupedia content was merged into Wikipedia, and it ceased in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters.

Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> on Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey.

The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. <b>A</b> <b>drain</b> identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E

5|$|The {{war ended}} in 1411 with the Peace of Thorn, in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home their {{negotiating}} {{advantage to the}} full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobles. Poland regained Dobrzyń Land, Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the Wkra river. Most of the Teutonic Order's territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. Władysław then proceeded to release many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved <b>a</b> <b>drain</b> on the Order's resources. This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław's regime after 1411, further fuelled by the granting of Podolia, disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king's two-year absence in Lithuania.|$|E
