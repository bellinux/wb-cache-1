This was done everywhere except in Kufa, where some scholars argue that, Ibn Masʿūd and his followers refused.

Writing for Jezebel, Hilary Crosley Coker crowned Clair [...] "a Trojan Horse for" [...] both feminism and black feminism. Dubbing the character [...] "a bonafide feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, a mother <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on {{the race of the}} sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E

2500|$|According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's [...] "inner war" [...] was {{a result}} of his close {{relationship}} with both of his parents, who were in many ways [...] "opposites." [...] Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during World War I and the 1920s. As a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife,</b> and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore [...] "worshipped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another view to {{the origin}} of name is also related to the Czech word práh (in the mean of a threshold) and a legendary {{etymology}} connects {{the name of the}} city with princess Libuše, prophetess <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> of mythical founder of the Přemyslid dynasty. She is said to have ordered the city [...] "to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house". The Czech práh might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river– thus providing a [...] "threshold" [...] to the castle.|$|E
