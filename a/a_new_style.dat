5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of American poetry, and, due to {{her experience}} of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E
5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995. His work on this story was fully painted, and while considered impressive was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} {{he would be able to}} interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics {{that focused on the}} criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E

5|$|Waugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War and moved his young family to Pixton Park in Somerset, the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment. He also began writing a novel in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style,</b> using first-person narration but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the Royal Marines in December and entered training at Chatham naval base. He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as Work Suspended and Other Stories (1943).|$|E
5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E
5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style,</b> the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings {{were built in}} this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E

5|$|Homogenic is {{the third}} {{international}} solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of Homogenic was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. Homogenic was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. Homogenic marked {{the first of several}} production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the Billboard 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|Other {{designers}} have also {{worked on the}} series. For Nine, the developers wanted to have <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> to suit the game's original vision, so the characters were designed by animator Yasuomi Umetsu. Another designer for the series is Masayuki Doi, who had {{made a name for}} himself with the Trauma Center series; and designed the main characters for Shin Megami Tensei IV. Inspired in his work by Kaneko's designs, he created the main characters' clothing to be a blend of Japanese and western fashions while incorporating design elements from the Star Wars series. For the Devil Survivor games, Atlus were aiming to appeal to a wider audience and reinvigorate the Megami Tensei franchise, hiring Suzuhito Yasuda as character designer for this purpose. Some monsters in the second Devil Survivor were designed by manga artist Mohiro Kitoh.|$|E

The Penguins, noted participants in FCS (I-AA) football, play their games at Stambaugh Stadium and enjoy {{one of the more}} supportive fan bases. All other YSU athletic teams compete in the Horizon League, which does not sponsor football. The Youngstown State men and women's basketball teams hold their games at Youngstown State's Beeghly Center. The teams average about 2,500 fans per game, a number that has been on the rise the past two seasons with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of play under Head Coach Jerry Slocum. In addition, the YSU baseball and softball teams have enjoyed local support and success. The baseball team reached the NCAA super-regionals in 2005, and the softball team did so in 2006.|$|E

5|$|After {{a dispute}} with Eazy-E, Dre left the group {{at the peak of}} its {{popularity}} in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr.Dre as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G. Dr.Dre's debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. Young ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, RBX, The Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Jewell.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the fourth}} Silent Hill game by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo's {{development}} group Team Silent began shortly {{after the release of}} Silent Hill 2 and alongside Silent Hill 3, with the intentions of creating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of game that would take the series in a different direction than the previous games. Despite what has been popularized around the Internet, Silent Hill 4 was always meant to be connected to Silent Hill and not an unrelated separate horror game that later became a Silent Hill title, although different gameplay mechanics and change were intended. News of the game's development was made public by October 2003, and official announcements by Konami followed at Gamers' Day 2004. The game was produced by the series' recurring sound designer and composer Akira Yamaoka. Its working title, prior to its incorporation into the rest of the series, was simply Room 302.|$|E

5|$|Hi-5 {{were one}} of Australia's highest paid {{entertainment}} entities, placing in the Business Review Weeklys annual list several times, earning an estimated A$18million in 2009. The members of Hi-5 are employees of the brand and do not hold equity. Their albums have been certified by ARIA as double platinum (It's a Party), platinum (Jump and Jive with Hi-5, Boom Boom Beat, It's a Hi-5 Christmas) and gold (Celebrate). By 2004 the original line-up had received five consecutive Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards in the same category, Best Children's Album, a then-record. By that time they had also received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program. Foley stated that Hi-5 set a benchmark for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of non-traditional children's entertainment. Hi-5 broke into the South East Asian market after the brand was sold by the Nine Network in 2012. Nine renewed its partnership with the franchise in 2016.|$|E
5|$|In ecclesiastical architecture, a {{style with}} {{more in common}} to that in England was adopted. Important figures {{included}} Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who developed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of church building which accorded with the fashionable High Gothic, but which adapted it for the worship needs of the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), who trained {{in the office of}} George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, worked mainly on small churches in the 'First Pointed' (or Early English) style that is characteristic of Scott's former assistants. By 1880 his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland, such as the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, Edinburgh University; the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central station, the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh and Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E

5|$|The first Christian {{hard rock}} group was {{possibly}} the California-based band Agape, {{formed in the}} late 1960s. Known for their psychedelic rock and blues influences, the band released an album titled Gospel Hard Rock in 1971, followed by Victims of Tradition in 1972. After Agape, the Resurrection Band was formed in 1972 in Milwaukee's Jesus People community and released the hard rock album Music to Raise the Dead in 1974. The Swedish group Jerusalem was formed in 1975 and is cited as another early Christian hard rock group. In 1978, Resurrection Band released its album Awaiting Your Reply and Jerusalem released Jerusalem (Volume 1). Both albums had a notable impact on Christian music culture. During that time, heavy metal was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of music for the Christian music industry, and many Christian labels did not expect it to sell well. However, Awaiting Your Reply hit big in the Christian market, and reached No. 6 on the Gospel album sales charts. Jerusalem also became an instant hit among listeners, and within {{the first six months}} the record sold 20,000 copies, unheard of within the genre of Christian rock in Europe. The Canadian Daniel Band is cited among the first bands, as is Barnabas.|$|E
5|$|Radama's {{successor}} Ranavalona I {{invited a}} shipwrecked craftsman named Jean Laborde {{to construct the}} tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and Manjakamiadana (built 1839–1841), the largest palace at the Rova. Laborde also produced {{a wide range of}} industrial products at factories in the highland village Mantasoa and a foundry in the Antananarivo neighborhood Isoraka. Ranavalona oversaw improvements to the city's infrastructure, including the construction of the city's two largest staircases at Antaninarenina and Ambondrona, which connect la ville moyenne ("the middle town") to the central marketplace at Analakely. In 1867, following a series of fires in the capital, Queen Ranavalona II issued a royal decree that permitted the use of stone and brick construction in buildings other than tombs. LMS missionaries' first brick house was built in 1869; it bore a blend of English, Creole and Malagasy design and served as a model for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style</b> of house that rapidly spread throughout the capital and across the highlands. Termed the trano gasy ("Malagasy house"), it is typically a two-story, brick building with four columns on the front that support a wooden veranda. In the latter third of the 19th century, these houses quickly replaced most of the traditional wooden houses of the city's aristocratic class. The growing number of Christians in Imerina prompted the construction of stone churches throughout the highlands, as well as four memorial cathedrals on key sites of martyrdom among early Malagasy Christians under the reign of Ranavalona I.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>style.</b> Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E
