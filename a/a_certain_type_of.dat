5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E

5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence {{in the context of}} what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E
