5|$|The immune {{response}} {{can be manipulated}} to suppress unwanted responses resulting from <b>autoimmunity,</b> allergy, and transplant rejection, and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system (see immunization) or cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} is a remarkably {{effective}} structure that incorporates specificity, inducibility and adaptation. Failures of host defense do occur, however, and fall into three broad categories: immunodeficiencies, <b>autoimmunity,</b> and hypersensitivities.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is {{increased}} in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid <b>autoimmunity</b> (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism {{before or after}} giving birth.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by <b>autoimmunity.</b> Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, <b>autoimmunity</b> results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and <b>autoimmunity</b> prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|In <b>autoimmunity</b> {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native {{molecules}} in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
25|$|While a {{high level}} of <b>autoimmunity</b> is unhealthy, a low level of <b>autoimmunity</b> may {{actually}} be beneficial. Taking the experience of a beneficial factor in <b>autoimmunity</b> further, one might hypothesize with intent to prove that <b>autoimmunity</b> is always a self-defense mechanism of the mammal system to survive. The system does not randomly lose the ability to distinguish between self and non-self, the attack on cells may be the consequence of cycling metabolic processes necessary to keep the blood chemistry in homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{immunodeficiency}} syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of <b>autoimmunity.</b> The decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for causing <b>autoimmunity</b> through perpetual immune system activation.|$|E
25|$|Microchimerism {{of fetal}} cells (offspring lymphoid cells in {{maternal}} circulation) may generate <b>autoimmunity</b> {{in women who}} have been previously pregnant. Generation of an autoimmune potential via microchimerism may lead to a switch from a silent form of <b>autoimmunity</b> with age-dependent decrease in self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Viral proteins, engulfed molecules, or {{degraded}} self-structures may initiate <b>autoimmunity</b> by {{molecular mimicry}} {{and increase the}} chances of SS development. Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C, and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 {{are among the most}} studied infectious agents in SS. Damaged self-structures targeted for apoptosis may be mistakenly exposed to the immune system, triggering <b>autoimmunity</b> in exocrine glands which are often prone to autoimmune responses.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} the sex role in <b>autoimmunity</b> vary. Women appear to {{generally}} mount larger inflammatory responses than men when their immune systems are triggered, increasing the risk of <b>autoimmunity.</b> Involvement of sex steroids is indicated by that many autoimmune diseases tend to fluctuate in accordance with hormonal changes, for example: during pregnancy, in the menstrual cycle, or when using oral contraception. A history of pregnancy also appears to leave a persistent increased risk for autoimmune disease. It {{has been suggested that}} the slight, direct exchange of cells between mothers and their children during pregnancy may induce <b>autoimmunity.</b> This would tip the gender balance {{in the direction of the}} female.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin gene {{products}} have several actions on acute and chronic inflammation and <b>autoimmunity,</b> with promising therapeutic applications.|$|E
25|$|In {{autoimmune}} polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also <b>autoimmunity</b> and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g. hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) {{and chronic}} mucocutaneous candidiasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} Yersinia enterocolitica bears structural similarity {{with the}} human thyrotropin receptor and was hypothesized {{to contribute to the}} development of thyroid <b>autoimmunity</b> arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.|$|E
25|$|IFN-α {{is another}} product of {{prolonged}} SAg exposure. This cytokine is closely linked with induction of <b>autoimmunity,</b> and the autoimmune disease Kawasaki Disease {{is known to}} be caused by SAg infection.|$|E
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam {{may lead to}} nephrotoxicity, neurobehavioural changes, <b>autoimmunity,</b> {{oxidative}} stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations, non-specific symptoms and complaints, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|In the Harrington–Hollingsworth {{experiment}} in 1950, William J. Harrington performed an exchange blood transfusion {{between himself and}} a thrombocytopenic patient, discovering the immune basis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and providing evidence {{for the existence of}} <b>autoimmunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|These are {{mediated}} by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as allergy, <b>autoimmunity,</b> chronic infections and sepsis are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and T helper (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are ways}} in which <b>autoimmunity</b> caused by {{molecular}} mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination {{seems to be the}} most common method to avoid <b>autoimmunity.</b> Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this {{has been shown to be}} ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the Bcl-2 gene {{has been}} {{identified}} as a cause of a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, prostate, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lung cancer, and a possible cause of schizophrenia and <b>autoimmunity.</b> It is also a cause of resistance to cancer treatments.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{suggests}} the female high tendency to get <b>autoimmunity</b> {{is due to}} an imbalanced X chromosome inactivation. The X-inactivation skew theory, proposed by Princeton University's Jeff Stewart, has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis. Other complex X-linked genetic susceptibility mechanisms are proposed and under investigation.|$|E
25|$|Since SS is {{associated}} with a high prevalence in women, sex hormones, especially estrogen, are believed to affect humoral and cell-mediated immune responses affecting susceptibility to the syndrome. Androgens are generally considered to prevent <b>autoimmunity.</b> Studies on mice models suggest estrogen deficiency stimulates presentation of autoantigens, inducing SS-like symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Neurogenic/central DI {{results from}} a lack of ADH; {{occasionally}} it can present with decreased thirst as regulation of thirst and ADH production occur in close proximity in the hypothalamus. It is encountered as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, neurosurgery, <b>autoimmunity</b> or cancer, or sometimes without an underlying cause (idiopathic).|$|E
25|$|Negative {{selection}} is not 100% effective, some autoreactive T cells escape thymic censorship, and are {{released into the}} circulation. Additional mechanisms of peripheral tolerance active in the periphery exist to silence these cells such as anergy, deletion, and regulatory T cells. If these peripheral tolerance mechanisms also fail, <b>autoimmunity</b> may arise.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia {{affects a}} few percent of newborns, and its {{prevalence}} in {{neonatal intensive care}} units (NICU) is high. Normally, it is mild and resolves without consequences. Most cases affect preterm birth infants and result from placental insufficiency and/or fetal hypoxia. Other causes, such as alloimmunity, genetics, <b>autoimmunity,</b> and infection, are less frequent.|$|E
25|$|Recently, AQP4 {{has been}} found to {{distinguish}} standard multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica, but as MS is a heterogeneous condition, and some MS cases are reported to be Kir4.1 channelopathies (<b>autoimmunity</b> against the potassium channels) it is still possible to consider NMO as part of the MS spectrum. Besides, some NMO-AQP(−) variants are not astrocytopathic, but demyelinating.|$|E
25|$|Whenever {{an immune}} {{response}} is provoked, {{there is some}} risk of <b>autoimmunity.</b> Therefore, immunocontraception trials typically check for signs of autoimmune disease. One concern with zona pellucida vaccination, in particular, is that in certain cases {{it appears to be}} correlated with ovarian pathogenesis. However, ovarian disease has not been observed in every trial of zona pellucida vaccination, and when observed, has not always been irreversible.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{involving}} {{carbon monoxide}} {{have been conducted}} in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential {{to be used to}} prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or <b>autoimmunity.</b> Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibodies}} to tissue transglutaminase follow a complex pathway of generation. For most antigens, T-cells specific to those antigens develop; for <b>autoimmunity,</b> either autoreactive T-cells are not suppressed, or antigens escape the protective process. T-cells are stimulated by antigen, presented by MHC molecules (HLA in humans) on antigen-reactive B-cells. These T-helper cells then stimulate B-cells to multiply and mature into plasma cells that make IgA and IgG to that protein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autoimmunity</b> {{possibly}} {{results by}} the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells. B and T cell tolerance for apoptotic cells is abrogated, and the lymphocytes get activated by these autoantigens; inflammation {{and the production}} of autoantibodies by plasma cells is initiated. A clearance deficiency in the skin for apoptotic cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).|$|E
25|$|Second, <b>autoimmunity</b> {{may have}} a role in {{allowing}} a rapid immune response {{in the early stages of}} an infection when the availability of foreign antigens limits the response (i.e., when there are few pathogens present). In their study, Stefanova et al. (2002) injected an anti-MHC Class II antibody into mice expressing a single type of MHC Class II molecule (H-2b) to temporarily prevent CD4+ T cell-MHC interaction. Naive CD4+ T cells (those that have not encountered any antigens before) recovered from these mice 36 hours post-anti-MHC administration showed decreased responsiveness to the antigen pigeon cytochrome C peptide, as determined by Zap-70 phosphorylation, proliferation, and Interleukin-2 production. Thus Stefanova et al. (2002) demonstrated that self-MHC recognition (which, if too strong may contribute to autoimmune disease) maintains the responsiveness of CD4+ T cells when foreign antigens are absent. This idea of <b>autoimmunity</b> is conceptually similar to play-fighting. The play-fighting of young cubs (TCR and self-MHC) may result in a few scratches or scars (low-level-autoimmunity), but is beneficial in the long-term as it primes the young cub for proper fights in the future.|$|E
25|$|Absence of {{positive}} antibodies or other <b>autoimmunity</b> (e.g., thyroiditis) in patient and family. However, Urbanova et al. found that about {{one quarter of}} Central European MODY patients are positive for islet cell autoantibodies (GADA and IA2A). Their expression is transient but highly prevalent. The autoantibodies were found in patients with delayed diabetes onset, and in times of insufficient diabetes control. The islet cell autoantibodies are absent in MODY {{in at least some}} populations (Japanese, Britons).|$|E
25|$|<b>Autoimmunity</b> {{also affects}} {{sulfatide}} levels. When an enhanced antibody response against myelin lipids occurs, including sulfatide {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis, the demyelination process is increased significantly. When sulfatide and gangliosides are present, the proliferation or production of Natural Killer-T cells that produce cytokines are activated. However, when CD1d deficient-mice are tested for their response to sulfatide, the same response is not seen, which indicates that in myelin, sulfatide is a glycolipid that possesses immunodominance.|$|E
25|$|Idiotype Cross-Reaction – Idiotypes are {{antigenic}} epitopes {{found in}} the antigen-binding portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule. Plotz and Oldstone presented evidence that <b>autoimmunity</b> can arise {{as a result of}} a cross-reaction between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host cell receptor for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell receptor is envisioned as an internal image of the virus, and the anti-idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is a {{fundamental}} property of the immune system. Tolerance involves non-self discrimination which {{is the ability of}} the normal immune system to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, but not self antigens. <b>Autoimmunity</b> is evoked when this tolerance to self antigen is broken. Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a fetus. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta.|$|E
