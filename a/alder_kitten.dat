25|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife. Insects {{found here}} that are scarce in the UK include the {{bleached}} pug (Eupithecia expallidata) and <b>alder</b> <b>kitten</b> (Furcula bicuspis) moths, {{as well as the}} soldier beetle species Malthius frontalis. Locally scarce insects include the green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys rubi) and the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). The site provides a habitat for butterflies, with common species including the comma, gatekeeper, red admiral, speckled wood and tortoiseshell.|$|E
25|$|A {{large area}} of the southerly hill is {{protected}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its biological importance; much of this hill {{is owned by the}} National Trust. Its summit plateau has an extensive area of lowland heath, a rare habitat in Cheshire, and one that is particularly important for reptiles. A substantial population of Lobed Maidenhair Spleenwort, a fern that is rare in Britain, is found here. Nationally scarce species observed in the area include the bleached pug and <b>alder</b> <b>kitten</b> moths, and the Malthus frontalis species of soldier beetle. The western escarpment of the northerly hill has also been designated an SSSI for its exposed Triassic sandstones.|$|E

5000|$|The fore wings grey, with a broad, dark grey central band, and a {{cloud of}} the same colour towards {{the tips of the}} wings; the band is {{inwardly}} margined by an almost straight black line, and outwardly by a curved line; the third line is double, and curved towards the costa, forming the inner edge of the grey cloud, the lower part is wavy. The first black line is inwardly, and the second outwardly edged with ochreous, and preceding the first is a series of black dots.The hindwings are also white with brown dots along the margin. The wingspan is 44-48 mm. Differs from Furcula furcula in its generally larger size, but more especially {{in the shape of the}} black line forming the outer margin of the central band; this forms a clean curve whereas, in the <b>alder</b> <b>kitten</b> it is always more or less angled or dentate towards the front margin of the wings.It flies at night from May to July [...] and is attracted to light, the male more so than the female. The larva is like a small version of the bizarre-looking larva of the puss moth, with the last pair of prolegs modified into two long [...] "tails". It feeds on poplar and aspen, and occasionally on willow.The species overwinters as a pupa in a cocoon on the trunk of its food plant.|$|E
