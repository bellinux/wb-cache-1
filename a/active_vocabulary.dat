25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her <b>active</b> <b>vocabulary</b> at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
2500|$|Linguists later discerned that, in January 1971, Genie showed {{understanding}} of only her own name, {{the names of}} a few others, and about 15–20 words, and her <b>active</b> <b>vocabulary</b> at the time consisted of two phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". They could not {{determine the extent of}} her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before January 1971, and therefore did not know whether she had acquired any or all of these words during the preceding two months. After observing Genie for some time they concluded that she was not selectively mute, and tests found no physiological or psychological explanation for her lack of language. Because her existing medical records also contained no clear indications of mental disabilities researchers determined that, due to her extreme isolation and lack of exposure to language during childhood, she had not acquired a first language.|$|E
2500|$|From {{tapes of}} Genie's {{first two months}} in the hospital, {{linguists}} discerned that by January 1971 she knew her own name, the words mother and father, the four color words red, blue, green, and brown, the words no and sorry, and a few miscellaneous nouns such as jewelry box, door, and bunny. She also appeared to understand negative commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them {{in the context of}} sentences was unclear. There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that she understood the intonation to indicate a yes or no question and that she understood imperative mood sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar. Her <b>active</b> <b>vocabulary</b> at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could remember what they might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not know whether she acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} multi-pass {{approach}} to real-time, largevocabulary speech recognition {{in which we}} dynamically manipulate the vocabulary between passes. For recognition tasks where subsets of the vocabulary can be triggered by the occurences of other words or phrases, a combination of unknown word modelling and vocabulary refinement can be utilized to attack large-vocabulary tasks with relatively small <b>active</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> We evaluate this approach within the JUPITER weather information domain by enabling recognition of all 30, 000 citystate pairs within the USA. By maximally precompiling the static and dynamic portions of our search space using finitestate transducers (FSTs), we splice dynamic-vocabulary components on-demand during decoding with negligible speed impact while enforcing cross-word context-dependent constraints. We find that a dynamic-vocabulary system can compete quite favorably with a single-pass, large-vocabulary system. For even larger vocabularies (e. g., street addresses), static compilation may be infeasible, making a dynamic-vocabulary approach necessary. 1...|$|R
40|$|We address {{personalization}} {{issues of}} image captioning, {{which have not}} been discussed yet in previous research. For a query image, we aim to generate a descriptive sentence, accounting for prior knowledge such as the user's <b>active</b> <b>vocabularies</b> in previous documents. As applications of personalized image captioning, we tackle two post automation tasks: hashtag prediction and post generation, on our newly collected Instagram dataset, consisting of 1. 1 M posts from 6. 3 K users. We propose a novel captioning model named Context Sequence Memory Network (CSMN). Its unique updates over previous memory network models include (i) exploiting memory as a repository for multiple types of context information, (ii) appending previously generated words into memory to capture long-term information without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem, and (iii) adopting CNN memory structure to jointly represent nearby ordered memory slots for better context understanding. With quantitative evaluation and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show {{the effectiveness of the}} three novel features of CSMN and its performance enhancement for personalized image captioning over state-of-the-art captioning models.

50|$|Productive vocabulary, therefore, {{generally}} {{refers to}} words {{that can be}} produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer. As with receptive vocabulary, however, there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an <b>active</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> Knowing how to pronounce, sign, or write a word {{does not necessarily mean}} that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} {{distinction}} {{that must be}} made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive (also called achieve) or receptive (also called receive); even within those opposing categories, there is often no clear distinction. Words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person's receptive vocabulary. These words may range from well-known to barely known (see degree of knowledge below). A person's receptive vocabulary is {{the larger of the}} two. For example, although a young child may not yet be able to speak, write, or sign, he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand {{a good portion of the}} language to which he or she is exposed. In this case, the child's receptive vocabulary is likely tens, if not hundreds of words, but his or her <b>active</b> <b>vocabulary</b> is zero. When that child learns to speak or sign, however, the child's <b>active</b> <b>vocabulary</b> begins to increase. It is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary, for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure, and can produce them, but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and changes to language abilities. Here, we used the revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) to identify suspected MCI in elderly individuals. We then analyzed written and spoken narratives to compare the language abilities between study participants with and without MCI in order to explore the relationship between cognitive and language abilities, and to identify a possible indicator for the early detection of MCI and dementia. We recruited 22 people aged 74 to 86 years (mean: 78. 32 years; standard deviation: 3. 36). The participants were requested to write and talk about one of the happiest events in their lives. Based on HDS-R scores, we divided the participants into 2 groups: the MCI Group comprised 8 participants with a score of 26 or lower, while the Healthy Group comprised 14 participants with a score of 27 or higher. The transcriptions of both written and spoken samples for each participant were used in the measurement of NLP-based language ability scores. Our analysis showed no significant differences in writing abilities between the 2 groups in any of the language ability scores. However, analysis of the spoken narrative showed that the MCI Group had a significantly larger vocabulary size. In addition, analysis of a metric that signified the gap in content between the spoken and written narratives also revealed a larger vocabulary size in the MCI Group. Individuals with early-stage MCI may be engaging in behavior to conceal their deteriorating cognition, thereby leading to a temporary increase in their <b>active</b> spoken <b>vocabulary.</b> These results indicate the possible detection of early stages of reduced cognition before dementia onset through the analysis of spoken narratives...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} encountered by Spanish students of Engineering when they are confronted with a technical text in English lies {{more often than not}} in their poor command of the lexicon, both general and subtechnical. It seems obvious that the learning of lengthy wordlists by rote must be discarded as idle, since the students can usually only recall a few items once a few days have passed. This particular tedious learning task can be eased by favouring a set of associations within the learners’ mental lexicon so as to relate a certain word with its designatum, or else to link mentally the word in English with its homologue (or near homologue) in the mother tongue. These associations share the common objective of adding to the learners’ vocabulary through the creation of word-links, both syntagmatically and paradigmatically. In this paper we present some techniques that have proved helpful to our students in building up both their <b>active</b> and passive <b>vocabulary</b> in quantitative and qualitative terms.
