They abhor the magic that can turn them back into their primitive forms. They control the 1850 and 1996 junctures more-or-less totally, and prefer to use armies, police, criminal syndicates and their human secret warriors to do their dirty work in places intrinsically hostile to them. However, they are skilled in kung fu, guns and have abilities related to their <b>animal</b> <b>heritage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Third Chimpanzee also {{examines}} how asymmetry in {{male and female}} mating behaviour is resolved through differing social structures across cultures, and how first contact between unequal civilizations almost always results in genocide. The book ends by noting that technological progress may cause environmental degradation on a scale leading to extinction. The original {{title of the book}} in its initial 1991 publication was The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee: How Our <b>Animal</b> <b>Heritage</b> Affects the Way We Live; the current title was adopted with the third edition in 2006. In between, the second edition of 2004 was titled The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee: Evolution and Human Life. In 2014, Diamond published an adapted version for young people with Seven Stories Press titled, The Third Chimpanzee for Young People.|$|E

In the first story drawn by Chmielewski for the Świat Młodych (Youth's World) magazine, Romek and A’Tomek find Tytus in a rocket (which at the time was part of the communist anti-American propaganda) as Tytus tells them he was abused by the foreign scientist. In the book version, however, Tytus came to life from a blot of ink the creator Papcio Chmiel accidentally spilled on the floor (this unusual origin fits the slightly surrealistic nature of the books). Tytus, however, many times mentioned (as well as visited) his [...] "homeland" [...] Trapezfik (which is a reference to Tytus' love for physical activity and a combination of the words [...] "trapeze" [...] and [...] "tumble").|$|E

40|$|Emotions {{are complex}} engagements with the world, {{sometimes}} highly reflexive ones. They are not, as some psychologists have claimed, merely {{the outcome of}} physiological processes (Solomon, 1984), or entities that possess us (like evil spirits in some societies), nor are they simply {{a part of our}} <b>animal</b> <b>heritage</b> (to be contrasted with human reason). What these perspectives miss is that emotions are intentional (in the technical sense of being ‘about ’ something); they signify something in-the-world and provide us with a strategy in a difficult situation (Sartre, 1939 / 2002). In other words, emotions are complex judgments and responses to the world involving a Self. By Self I mean the position(s) we take on {{as a member of a}} community (or communities), which mediate our relationship to the world and others from a particular social point of view. As such, an emotion cannot be adequately described in the abstract – as one finds in most psychology textbooks – but must be analyzed concretely, in situ. Angle’s El guerrillero provides us with excellent material for a concrete social analysis of the emotions. The whole story is a stream of consciousnes...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Architecture (Professional) The National Research Foundation has {{recognized}} the zoo {{as a critical}} player towards the conservation of <b>animal</b> <b>heritage</b> in southern Africa. Yet, as we have seen, tantamount to having outstanding research methods, is having the needed facilities to deploy them effectively. In order for this to come to bare, the zoo requires a careful assessment of architectural concerns. This thesis presents exactly those. The wildlife medical centre here proposed precipitates out of a comprehensive study engaging the following issues of concern; zoo healthcare and rehabilitation, sub-nature and animal architecture. The proposed site location currently supports the out-dated hospital (built in 1969), {{which is on the}} zoo's south-eastern corner along Boom Street. Its facilities include a veterinary hospital, research laboratories, a bio-bank, temporary wards, and rehabilitation wards whose design derives not only from traditional matters of architectural concern but also the informed, first-hand knowledge of the animals' needs and preferences as understood by the zoo's staff. Additionally, the proposed design exposes and showcases the zoo's research facilities along its public interface in order to better serve its educational efforts. Thus, this proposal presents the means for promoting conservation awareness and, at the same time, empowers its dedicated staff...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{good deal}} more {{suffering}} in human life that there is in our theories of emotion. One reason for this appears to be that our theories tend to focus on individual emotions or moods. Thus, we focus on terms such as anger or anxiety without considering that there common root is anguish. Another reason is that we want to ground our theories in our evolutionary heritage, so we focus on emotions that we share with other animals and that are clearly observable, such as the Big Four of anger, fear, happiness and sadness. Yet while animals certainly appear to experience pain, and show the effects of loss, they do not the way anticipate pain and loss in the way we do when we consider aging, sickness, death, and the loss of those we love. Hence, in addition to examining specific emotions and relating emotion to our <b>animal</b> <b>heritage,</b> it is important to contexturalize emotion in our broader human being. When we do this we must come to grips with emotional experiences such as suffering and mysticism. When we begin with such experiences, rather than with facial expressions, we find that they are focused on our relationship with something that is radically Other than ourselves. Today, in our secular culture with its scientific parlance, we may speak as Jim Averill has, of our “system of cognitiv...|$|E

40|$|Nicolas Baudin's 1801 - 1804 {{voyage of}} {{discovery}} {{to the southern}} lands was the only scientific expedition to collect specimens of the dwarf emu Dromaius ater, endemic to King Island, Bass Strait, Australia. The expedition's naturalist, Francois Peron, documented the only {{detailed description of the}} life history of the birds (translated here in full for the first time), and the artist Charles-Alexandre Lesueur made the only visual record of a living bird. But the King Island emu's textual, taxonomic and even taxidermic representations were confused with other species and some of their remains, scattered across Europe, are elusive. A bird collected as part {{of one of the most}} ambitious ordering enterprises in early nineteenth-century science has been more or less forgotten. This thesis recovers the natural and unnatural history of the King Island emu, a species extinct in the wild since 1805. Placing the birds at the centre of the narrative, it traces their first encounters with Europeans to their last (and lasting) confinement in the menagerie and Museum. This innovative approach is in keeping with Animal Studies, an interdisciplinary field committed to examining the relationships between human and non-human species. In recounting the birds' story, the thesis discusses the general pattern of contemporaneous scientific collecting and some of the paradoxes of the nature and history of natural history: the link between discovery and demise. Analysing a wide variety of textual records, it demonstrates how competing principles of organisation in Republican natural science, and scientific expeditions, influenced attitudes toward and understandings of the King Island emu, with material consequences for their conservation. The thesis also reveals how visual representations further contributed, albeit unwittingly, to the species' epistemological and literal extinction. While such evidence does much to expose human attitudes to animals, it also shows the ways in which animal "specimens," far from being inert objects of subsidiary influence, actually played a major role in human endeavours. Proof of the emus' life experiences, written on and in their physical remains, likewise provides insight into animal realities only hinted at in the human documents. The thesis thus uncovers a rich seam of alternative experience and interpretation of human and <b>animal</b> <b>heritage</b> while suggesting a rethinking of our taken-for-granted place in the hierarchy of nature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the fictional island and assesses {{the impact of}} Darwinism on the genre. I show how islands have been a recurring feature in European literature, fictional spaces where authors create a microcosm in which they satirise, criticise or hold up a mirror to their own society. I argue that traditonal Utopian islands are static realms and that through the introduction of evolution (Darwin and Wallace made their most important discoveries regarding the mechanism of evolution on islands) fictional islands {{of the last century}} and a half have been radically transformed. The elements of chance, change, random mutation, natural and sexual selection, survival of the fittest as well as the knowledge of an <b>animal</b> <b>heritage</b> have changed the castaway experience, making it a far more anti-utopian one. The publication of The Origin of Species forced a reappraisal of all areas of knowledge and I show how, in the laboratory of the fictional island, authors examine the implications of Darwin's theory. Closely related issues are also taken into account, such as degeneration, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, developments in evolutionary anthropology, psychoanalysis and the coming of modern scientific method. I conduct a close reading of H. G. Wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau in which I consider the phenomenon of the mad scientist (in this case a modern, distinctly Darwinian scientist). Using some of Wells' scientific articles as a starting point, I show how the doctor tries to replicate a speeded up version of evolution in his island laboratory. Wells was a student of T. H. Huxley and the chapter {{examines the}} situation on the island in relation to Huxley's famous essay, "Evolution and Ethics", in which he argues that the "cosmic process" must be fought with an "ethical process". Wells called the novel a "theological grotesque" and I show how the novelist parodies orthodox Christianity and creates a protagonist who is a perverted evolutionary "god". Much of the remainder of the chapter is a detailed examination of degeneration in which I describe how the beast begins to resurface in Moreau's half-human creations {{as well as in the}} human protagonists (graphically evidenced in a "return" to cannibalism). A chapter on Joseph Conrad considers the pessimistic intellectual, philosophical and metaphysical forces that affect the novelist and his protagonist. First I show how the fin de siècle mood, in conjunction with the popular contemporary philosophies of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche (perceived in the light of Darwinian science) colour the cerebral landscape of Victory. The main thrust of this chapter concerns the issues of degeneration and devolution and in this respect I examine contemporary fears concerning cannibalism, thermodynamics, atavism and the anarchy resulting from a corrosion within society. I show further how the issue of sexuality (with relation to such issues as miscegenation, heredity and perversion) bears directly upon the idea of degeneracy. Finally the chapter considers the case of the imperial subject, the other "races" represented on Samburan. Here I am particularly interested in the anthropological application of Darwinism: far from being degenerate or inferior, Conrad depicts the racial other as having the "biological" advantage. By the time William Golding wrote Lord of the Flies, evolutionary elements were coming to novelists diluted in many different areas of enquiry. I discuss how Golding's knowledge of (evolutionary) anthropology and archaeology create a blueprint for the regression of English schoolboys to the level of "savages" and metaphorically to the level of early hominids and even animals. I show how the evil they try to externalise arises from within and is a part of their "animal" heritage. The chapter traces the path of their regression looking at aspects of their microcosmic society and religion. I also consider the situation of Golding's boys with relation to Freud's Totem and Taboo and his theories of child sexuality. Finally Golding's attempt to chart an existential and spiritual course through the waters of evolutionary determinism is discussed. In my concluding chapter I account for the "demise" of the Darwinian island showing how new issues are dominating the genre and in a close reading of Marianne Wiggins' John Dollar and J. M. Coetzee's Foe I examine how and why the postmodern and poststructuralist island fails to live up to the exigencies of the genre. </p...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} breed {{would have become}} extinct, several {{interested}} breeders came together and formed the Newfoundland Pony Society in 1980. The group was formed to gather the remaining free-roaming herds, register the horses and breed them in captivity, and was successful in locating around 300 animals. In 1997, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador passed the <b>Heritage</b> <b>Animals</b> Act, which made the Newfoundland pony the first (and, so far, only) <b>heritage</b> <b>animal</b> of Newfoundland and Labrador. A subsequent order designated the Newfoundland Pony Society as [...] "the group which will maintain the registry of ponies and otherwise act {{for the preservation of}} the animal." [...] In part, this Act required anyone wishing to export ponies from Newfoundland to first acquire a permit; this ensured that ponies were going to private homes instead of slaughterhouses. Also in 1997, the Newfoundland Pony Breed Association was formed. This group sought to have the Newfoundland pony recognized under the Canadian Animal Pedigree Act, which may have given it additional protection and recognition. In March 2014, the Newfoundland Pony Society stated that they believed the breed should not have federal recognition, believing that the [...] "federal act is meant for farm stock and breeding animals", not heritage breeds. Members of the society also fear that protection of the breed may be lessened under federal law when compared with current provincial regulations. However, the provincial government will make the final decision on whether to move forward with the process for federal recognition.|$|R

Soil erosion undermines not only agricultural production but also winning means needed of existence for millions of people, while gradual disappearance of species of plants and <b>animals</b> diminishes our <b>heritage</b> biological. For {{the first time in}} history the structure atmosphere land is modifying by the destruction of the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiations, it is causing accumulation of greenhouse gases, which leads inevitably to warming climate Earth. Today is widely accepted the concept of sustainable development. It was defined the World Conference on Environment and Development in 1987, as a development that would ensure the present needs without jeopardizing the future generations capacity to satisfy its own requirements. The governments, including the Romanian, have started to react when devastating environmental changes have become ever more obvious. However, the discrepancy between what should be done to protect the capacity of planet to ensure living conditions and that what was achieved in practice is on the rise. In our country the phenomenon of environment degradation with all the concern displayed and the financial effort accomplished, obviously insufficient, tends to magnify, especially in the last period as a result of intensification of polluant industrial activity. In this sense, any cost cannot be considered too big, for the protection of life as a last resort...|$|R
5000|$|Thechikkottukavu Ramachandran An {{elephant}} named Nayarambalam Balakrishnan, one of {{the elephants}} in the first batch of tuskers brought from Bihar in the 1970s, died in that decade, after it was attacked. Although the autopsy showed that the elephant had been wounded before its death, no one was arrested. In another incident in 1977, another jumbo named Kattakkada Vishnu, owned by Rahul Timbers, died succumbed from unusual wounds. According to Thrissur-based NGO <b>Heritage</b> <b>Animal</b> Task Force (HATF) which works {{for the welfare of}} elephants, these two deaths were not the only cases, and that elephants have become victims to petty rivalries. “Take Ramachandran's case. There is so much inside politics involved in this, mainly ego clashes between the temple committee members, elephant owners and many other committees related to temple festivals and elephants,” says VK Venkitachalam, HATF Secretary. He cautions that if at least one person is not caught, such attacks will continue, and most would occur without people even realising it. “In the name of fan associations many people visit this elephant regularly and the temple committee promotes it, but this should be avoided. An elephant is not an artifact on display,” he adds. HATF claims that the sexual drives of elephants in captivity in Kerala is controlled by adding additives in the rice feed and is called ‘Sukha Chikithsa’. “Elephants are basically wild animals, cooked rice is not their (natural) food, so that was the first fault. And I know that they used to mix animal fat in the rice feed to suppress ‘musth’ (in males). All this is against nature’s laws,” he said. (Musth is an annual phenomenon, in which the male elephants experience heightened sexual instinct for a short period) HATF also said that temple committees replace mahouts from time to time, which creates friction between the mahouts, and could also cause a disgruntled person to inflict settle scores by infliciting harm on the animals. “An elephant is not something that humans should take care of. The forest is their habitat, and we shouldn’t be feeding them what we want them to eat. (With all this) they become a show piece for hundreds of people who visit the elephant, and may engage in cruelty to the animal,” he says. HATF is demanding that everyone connected with the temple including all the mahouts who looked after Ramachandran should be questioned, but the temple committee is dismissive. Vasudevan said that temple staff would “obviously not have a role in such a mean act as Ramachandran is the favourite”. But he also said that the temple committee would pursue the complaint until the culprit is caught.|$|R
