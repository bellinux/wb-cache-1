2500|$|The {{discovery}} in 1912 of the amplifying {{ability of the}} Audion vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, solved these problems. [...] The vacuum tube feedback oscillator, invented in 1912 by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner, was a cheap source of continuous waves and could be easily modulated to make an AM transmitter. [...] Modulation {{did not have to}} be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube,</b> so the microphone or other audio source didn't have to handle high power. [...] Wartime research greatly advanced the art of AM modulation, and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. [...] The vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of AM radio broadcasting around 1920, the first electronic mass entertainment medium. [...] Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for radio broadcasting until FM broadcasting began after World War 2.|$|E
50|$|Although four-, six-, {{and even}} a few rare eight-tube radios were produced, they were not common. The four-tube version with vacuum tube {{rectifier}} was of inferior performance, as they typically had no IF <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube,</b> although some four-tube designs with a selenium rectifier in place of the rectifier tube avoided this problem. The six-tube versions added either a RF <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube,</b> a push-pull audio power <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube,</b> or a beat frequency oscillator tube (to listen to Morse code or single-sideband modulation transmissions). However, these radios cost significantly more and sold in smaller quantities. The eight-tube versions cost even more, adding two or more of the features of the six-tube versions and sometimes an extra IF <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{typically}} have much lower feedback ratios, {{and in any}} case almost always have output transformers that limit how low the output impedance can be.

50|$|Haeff {{joined the}} Hughes Aircraft Company in 1950 {{to lead the}} Electron Tube Laboratory, where he {{continued}} producing memory and travelling-wave tubes and invented the electron-stream <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube</b> and resistive-wall amplifier with Charles Birdsall. The Electron Tube Laboratory was merged with Hughes' other research teams in 1954, becoming the Hughes Research Laboratories, with Haeff as their director. He left in 1961, exhausted, and became an independent inventor and consultant, creating a plasma containment device, a volumetric measuring device, and predicting laser-based scanning. He formally retired in 1975, and died at home on 16 November 1990.|$|E

25|$|A crossed-field {{amplifier}} (CFA) is {{a specialized}} vacuum tube frequently {{used as a}} microwave amplifier in very-high-power transmitters.

25|$|Some tubes, such as magnetrons, traveling-wave tubes, carcinotrons, and klystrons, combine {{magnetic}} and electrostatic effects.

50|$|The {{overall effect}} of the {{original}} developments was to produce a highly effective power <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube,</b> whose anode characteristic {{is very much like}} that of a pentode, but which has greater efficiency as a result of reduced screen current. A further bonus was that third harmonic distortion was much reduced relative to a comparable pentode (Terman pp 198-9). Beam tetrode audio power output valves were introduced in 1937, and quickly replaced conventional pentodes in this application. Later developments produced beam power tubes which were capable of high-power output at frequencies extending into the UHF region.|$|E
5000|$|Analogue S meters are {{actually}} sensitive microammeters, {{with a full}} scale deflection of 50 to 100 μA. In AM receivers, the S meter can {{be connected to the}} main detector or use a separate detector at the final IF stage. This is the preferred method for CW and SSB receivers. Another approach in the days of electronic tubes (valves) was to connect the S meter to the screen grid circuit of the final IF <b>amplifier</b> <b>tube.</b> A third option is to connect the S meter to the AGC line through a suitable level conversion circuit.|$|E
