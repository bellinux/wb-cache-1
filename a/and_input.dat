5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc <b>and</b> <b>input</b> disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E

5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior colliculus, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls <b>and</b> <b>input</b> from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E

Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance <b>and</b> <b>input</b> during times of difficulty.

The gist of Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had known all his life.

In In this paper, we discuss a large class of delayed dynamical systems with almost periodic self-inhibitions, inter-connection weights, <b>and</b> <b>inputs.</b> This model is universal and includes delayed systems with time-varying delays, distributed delays as well as combination of both. We prove that under some mild conditions, the system has a unique almost periodic solution, which is globally exponentially stable. We propose a new approach, which is independent of existing theory concerning with existence of almost periodic solution for dynamical systems...|$|R

5|$|The program {{requires}} that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations <b>and</b> <b>input</b> from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.|$|E
