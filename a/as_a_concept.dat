5|$|Notable {{for being}} an early example of a 3D {{platform}} game, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos began development <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> for a 3D platformer in which the player controlled the character Yoshi from Nintendo's Super Mario series. The concept was pitched to Nintendo by Argonaut, but was ultimately rejected by the company, ending Argonaut's relationship with Nintendo and prompting them to design a new character and retool the game as an original property.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a span of two years at Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona and the old town hall of Govan, Scotland. It has been described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> album loosely based around a night of partying and the morning effects after. The album has more of a dance-oriented sound, featuring styles of dance-punk, new wave, and electropop, marking {{a departure from the}} band's post-punk sound, which was featured on their past two albums.|$|E

5|$|Captain America: The First Avenger began <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> in 1997 and was {{scheduled}} for distribution by Artisan Entertainment. However, a lawsuit, not settled until September 2003, disrupted the project. In 2005, Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount Pictures. Directors Jon Favreau and Louis Leterrier were interested in directing the project before Johnston was approached in 2008. The principal characters were cast between March and June 2010. Production of Captain America: The First Avenger began in June 2010, and filming took place in London, Manchester, Caerwent, and Liverpool in the United Kingdom, and Los Angeles in the United States. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Hi-5 {{were formed}} in 1998 in Sydney, Australia as a children's musical group. Television {{producer}} Helena Harris, {{who had worked}} on Bananas in Pyjamas, co-created Hi-5 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> for a new television show. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans (The Miraculous Mellops, Mirror, Mirror) developed the series as preschool entertainment, incorporating educational trends with a pop music appeal, using music and movement to capture the attention of children. Featuring five performers, the cast are intended to act as older siblings of viewers, rather than adults teaching children. The name of the group {{was derived from the}} high five gesture.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Claude Mézières {{himself has}} worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> artist {{on a number}} of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for {{director}} Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René Barjavel's novel La Nuit des temps (The Ice People). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel Hard to Be a God for director Peter Fleischmann. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières' concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in Mézières Extras.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E
5|$|The {{attraction}} originated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> {{created by}} Walt Disney, who {{drew inspiration from}} the ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad built in his backyard. The Disneyland Railroad first {{opened to the public}} at Disneyland's grand opening on July 17, 1955. Since that time, multiple alterations have been made to its route, including the addition of two large dioramas in the late 1950s and mid-1960s. Several changes have also been made to its rolling stock, including the conversion of one of its train cars into a parlor car in the mid-1970s, and the switch from diesel oil to biodiesel to fuel its locomotives in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{insanity}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used {{until the late}} 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1941 {{officials}} at the War Office and in the Army had finally decided that light tanks <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> were a liability, and too vulnerable {{to be used by}} the British Army. This was due to the poor performance of British light tanks during the Battle of France, caused when a shortage of tanks designed to engage enemy tanks had led to light tanks being deployed against German armour; the resulting high casualties led to the War Office rethinking the suitability of the light tank design. The pre-war role of the light tank, that of reconnaissance, had also been found to be better carried out by scout cars which had smaller crews and better cross-country abilities. Consequently, by the time that significant numbers of the Mk VIII were being produced by Metro-Cammell, they had already become obsolete and did not see combat. There was a requirement for a limited number of light tanks within the organization of British armoured divisions, but this had already been met by the American-produced M5 Stuart light tank. A policy report issued in December 1942 suggested that the tank could be issued to reconnaissance regiments or special light tank regiments raised for specialized operations. These suggestions were discussed and discarded, and instead it was decided that those tanks built should be handed over to the Royal Air Force for use in defending airfields and airbases.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, vocalist Max Cavalera {{left the}} band and formed Soulfly. The other members {{announced}} that they would continue under the Sepultura name and were searching for a replacement. Derrick Green was chosen to replace Cavalera, and with the new vocalist the band released Against in 1998. Nation was released in 2001, the band's last studio album with Roadrunner Records. Sepultura signed to German label SPV and released Roorback. Dante XXI was released in 2006 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> album inspired by the literary classic Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. Igor Cavalera left the band in 2006 {{and was replaced by}} Jean Dolabella. In 2009 Sepultura released A-Lex, a concept album about A Clockwork Orange, followed by 2011's Kairos. Drummer Eloy Casagrande replaced Dollabella and in 2013 the band released The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart, which was loosely based on sci-fi film Metropolis. In 2017, Sepultura released their fourteenth studio album Machine Messiah.|$|E
5|$|The Final Cut is {{the twelfth}} studio album by the English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and on 2 April by Columbia Records in the United States. It was Pink Floyd's last studio album to include founding member, bass guitarist and songwriter Roger Waters, and their only album {{on which he}} alone is credited for writing and composition. It was also the only Pink Floyd album that does not feature keyboardist Richard Wright. Waters originally planned The Final Cut as a soundtrack album for the 1982 film Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of the}} Falklands War, he rewrote it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> album, exploring what he considered the betrayal of his father, who died serving in the Second World War. Waters sings most of the lyrics; lead guitarist David Gilmour provides lead vocals on only one track. The packaging, also designed by Waters, reflects the album's war theme.|$|E
