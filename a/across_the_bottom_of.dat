5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally {{back and forth across}} the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E
5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E

25|$|A red {{and white}} bar <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen {{indicates}} battle advantage. Where the {{red and white}} portions of the bar meet indicates which duelist has the advantage. The closer the meeting point is to a duelist, the worse they are doing. When the player properly performs a blocking move, or strikes the enemy, the bar shifts towards the opponent, indicating that he has lost advantage. The duelist with more advantage can attack faster, while the duelist with less advantage attacks slower. Also, a failed attack has the chance of disorienting the attacker, causing them to become even slower for a short time.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] were often {{difficult}} for listeners to decipher, both {{due to their}} nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that the Nevermind album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, [...] "We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying." [...] MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the [...] "Lithium" [...] single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was [...] "the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties" [...] and wrote, [...] "Like 'Louie,' only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." [...] Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that [...] "what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," [...] and added, [...] "Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [...] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts." ...|$|E

Underwater Hockey is now played worldwide, with the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques, abbreviated CMAS, as the world governing body.

2500|$|For the 2015 season, the {{graphics}} were completely overhauled {{to match the}} motif {{that has been used}} for ESPN's NFL studio programming since the year prior. However, the studio programming uses the new motif only for introductions and transitions, while the actual insert graphics use the standard ESPN package used for SportsCenter and all other sports. Meanwhile, MNF uses the NFL motif for all insert graphics, not just introductions and transitions. Most notably, the NFL motif uses a horizontal score bar <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen, whereas the standard graphics package uses a score box. The layout is standard, with teams on the background of their color, with timeout indicators also displaying in team colors. Experimentally, the score bar [...] "auto-hides" [...] itself during plays, though it is shown permanently during the final two minutes of each half and, if necessary, overtime.

2500|$|In the 1760s, {{a line of}} spiked chevaux de frise was {{constructed}} across {{the top and bottom}} ends of the Inundation. Ditches twelve feet wide and three feet deep were dug across the Inundation {{on both sides of the}} chevaux de frise so that if the lake ever dried out it would still serve as a barrier. Another barrier {{was constructed}} at the south end of the Inundation, and stakes were driven into the bed of the lake to serve as underwater obstacles. An unnamed correspondent for the London Chronicle wrote on 19 April 1762: [...] "thro' the middle [...] we have run chevaux de frize, lined with plates of iron, and studded with iron spikes, one row pointing towards Spain, and the other towards the garrison, to prevent desertion. They are five feet high, sunk in the mud, and the spikes above the water; by clasping your hands together, your fingers extended and the backs up, you will have an exact idea of them. Through this inundation an enemy must march to come near us, for the causeway is narrow, and when the tide is at lowest ebb, thirty men could not march a-breast upon the beach and causeway; upon which point we can bring above 300 cannon and mortars to bear, besides wall-pieces and small arms."

50|$|Head and Shoulders {{formation}} {{consists of}} a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder and a line drawn as the neckline. The left shoulder is formed {{at the end of}} an extensive move during which volume is noticeably high. After the peak of the left shoulder is formed, there is a subsequent reaction and prices slide down to a certain extent which generally occurs on low volume. The prices rally up to form the head with normal or heavy volume and subsequent reaction downward is accompanied with lesser volume. The right shoulder is formed when prices move up again but remain below the central peak called the Head and fall down nearly equal to the first valley between the left shoulder and the head or at least below the peak of the left shoulder. Volume is lesser in the right shoulder formation compared to the left shoulder and the head formation. A neckline is drawn <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left shoulder, the head and the right shoulder. When prices break through this neckline and keep on falling after forming the right shoulder, it is the ultimate confirmation of the completion of the Head and Shoulders Top formation.
