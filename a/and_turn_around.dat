5|$|BL-80 {{continues}} {{to the east}} past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were {{moving down the}} road to the rear. Many soldiers on foot were on the road. Champney tried repeatedly but in vain to get these men to stop <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around.</b> The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried in vain to reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E

25|$|The {{station was}} built in 1912 and {{remained}} in operation until 1938 when financial distress caused the New York, Westchester & Boston Railway to shut down. The property lay dormant for many years until it was purchased by a local artist in the mid-1950s for conversion to a private residence.

25|$|In October 2012, Lexus {{staged a}} {{race as a}} result of a charity bet between pilot Marc Arnold and Kent Stevinson to race a Lexus LFA against an Eclipse 500 jet. The top speed of the LFA is 203mph while the Eclipse 500 can reach speeds of 400mph. In order to make it a fair test to measure acceleration, handling, braking, {{according}} to Paul Williamson the race took place on a 4800 feet runway. The plane was given a head start of about 110mph with the Lexus LFA launching from a dead stop as the jet flew by at 110mph. As the race begun, the plane started accelerating from 110mph and Lexus LFA launched from a dead stop. Both accelerated to the end of the runway where the LFA will have to brake <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> with the plane turning around as well. Then it was a race all the way back to the starting line with the LFA needing to brake before the plane in order for the Lexus LFA to win the race. The proceeds of the win were to benefit charities. Lexus decided to choose the Lexus LFA Nurburgring Edition for the race and professional race car driver and champion Scott Pruett was selected as the driver for the Lexus LFA. Once the race was complete, the Lexus LFA was able to win through completing the race including a full dead stop at the end before the plane cleared the finish line 2 seconds ahead of the Eclipse 500 jet. The Lexus LFA hit a maximum speed of 171mph before it hit the braking zone.|$|E

60|$|Once {{the idea}} had germinated, it {{mastered}} him, and the return voyage to San Francisco was like a dream. He was drunken with unguessed power and felt {{that he could do}} anything. In the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective. Clearly, and for the first lime, he saw Ruth and her world. It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and about and examine. There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it. To write! The thought was fire in him. He would begin {{as soon as he got}} back. The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters. He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper. He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print. While he wrote, he could go on studying. There were twenty-four hours in each day. He was invincible. He knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him. He would not have to go to sea again--as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht. There were other writers who possessed steam yachts. Of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying. And then, after some time,--a very indeterminate time,--when he had learned and prepared himself, he would write the great things and his name would be on all men's lips. But greater than that, infinitely greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of Ruth. Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid dream arose. He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God's mad lovers.|$|E
