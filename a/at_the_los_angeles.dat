5|$|Several {{versions}} of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative {{responses to the}} previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.|$|E

He eventually returned to Mumbai and trained at the Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles lost in {{the finals}} to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 {{entering}} the fourth quarter, and 10 with {{a minute and a}} half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short.

5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high.

Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> radio station where she worked.

A premiere took place at Rhode Island on June 28, which was a freely available event giving attendees the opportunity to buy tickets for $75 to benefit four charities: the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, the Autism Project of Rhode Island, Adoption Rhode Island, and Hasbro Children's Hospital. The film was released in IMAX on September 21, 2007, with additional footage {{that had not been}} included in the general theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned that down. The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. Nobody had its American premiere on 25 June 2011, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Film Festival, nearly two years since its original debut.
