5|$|On 14 October 1975, Vulcan B.2 XM645 of No.9 Squadron {{lost its}} left {{undercarriage}} and damaged the airframe when it undershot the runway at RAF Luqa in Malta. The aircraft broke {{up over the}} village of Żabbar while turning inbound for an emergency landing. The pilot and co-pilot escaped using their ejection seats, the other five crew members were killed. Large aircraft pieces fell on the village; one woman, Vincenza Zammit, was killed by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable,</b> some 20 others were injured.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011, two tigers {{were found}} dead in Maharashtra: a male tiger was trapped and killed in a wire snare; a tigress died of {{electrocution}} after chewing at <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> supplying power to a water pump; another tigress was {{found dead in}} Kanha Tiger Reserve landscape — poisoning is suspected to be the cause of her death.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the war in}} the 1990s, South Ossetia {{struggled}} economically. South Ossetian GDP {{was estimated}} at US$15 million (US$250 per capita) in a work published in 2002. Employment and supplies are scarce. Additionally, Georgia cut off supplies of electricity to the region, which forced the South Ossetian government to run <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> through North Ossetia. The majority of the population survives on subsistence farming. Virtually the only significant economic asset that South Ossetia possesses is control of the Roki Tunnel that is used to link Russia and Georgia, from which the South Ossetian government reportedly obtains as much as a third of its budget by levying customs duties on freight traffic.|$|E
50|$|Tough rubber-sheathed {{cable is}} a type of cable which {{normally}} consists of a black outer sheath of rubber with several conductors inside. The rubber provides an abrasion-resistant, corrosion-resistant, waterproof, protective covering for <b>an</b> insulated <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} home-made. It {{consisted}} of 30 pounds of gelignite and gun cotton {{encased in a}} wooden box. To detonate it, the volunteers had <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> detonator which was connected to <b>an</b> exploder by <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In December 2006, the Finnish Government {{rejected}} the project. [...] In May 2007, United Power {{announced it will}} give up its effort to build <b>an</b> undersea <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> from Russia to Finland and will look instead for direct link from Russia to Sweden across the Baltic Sea.|$|R
25|$|For safety, train {{formations}} {{consist of}} one locomotive pushing a single carriage {{up the mountain}} and leading it down again while the locomotive brakes allow a controlled descent. (On opening, the usual practice {{was to have a}} locomotive pushing two coaches; this was changed in 1923.) The carriage is not coupled to the locomotive, as gravity keeps the two in contact, although <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> is run between the locomotive and the carriage, which enables a buzzer to be used to signal between the driver and the guard. The cable is designed to pull free if the locomotive and carriage separate. Not being coupled prevents a carriage being dragged down the mountain if a locomotive derailed, as happened in the opening day accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{electro-pneumatic}} {{action was}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, and {{is considered by many}} to be the single most significant development in pipe organs. Up to the turn of the 20th century, all pipe organs were operated by a tracker, tubular pneumatic, or pneumatic Barker-lever action, where the keys and pedals were physically connected to the pipe valves via wooden trackers, except in the case of tubular pneumatic, where all actions were operated by air pressure. Hope-Jones' electro-pneumatic action eliminated this by using wind pressure, controlled by electric solenoids, to operate the pipe valves, and solenoids and pistons to control and operate the various stop tabs, controls, keys and pedals on the console. This action allowed the console to be physically detached from the organ. All signals from the console were transmitted by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> to an electro-pneumatic relay, and from there to the pipes and effects in the organ chambers.|$|E
2500|$|Contractors {{were hired}} {{to assist in}} the setting up of a large tent in one of the sub-camps at the Jamboree. Some of the adult scout leaders {{assisted}} the contractors in setting the poles. Due to the zoning and the length of the pole, the pole made contact with <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b> Those that were killed were: Michal J. Shibe from Troop 129, Mike LaCroix from Troop 711, Ronald Bitzer from Troop 129, and Scott Edward Powell. [...] Scott Powell was the Scout Camp Leader at Camp Gorsuch in Chugiak, Alaska and had recently retired to Perrysville, Ohio. Mike Shibe had two sons at the Jamboree and LaCroix had one.|$|E

5000|$|When {{conducted}} by <b>an</b> ordinary <b>electric</b> <b>cable,</b> RF current {{has a tendency}} to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as connectors and travel back down the cable toward the source, causing a condition called standing waves. Therefore, RF current must be carried by specialized types of cable called transmission line.|$|R
5|$|Joseph Sachs {{had also}} invented <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> fire engine vehicle {{consisting}} of a wagon on which a spring-supported platform held <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> motor which operated two rotary water pumps. The motor was supplied with <b>a</b> reel of <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> {{and it could be}} regulated from either side of the vehicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "The marrow {{itself is}} surrounded, as {{the centre of}} <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> is, by its {{guarding}} threads--that is to say, {{by a number of}} cords or threads coming between it and the wood, and differing from all others in the tree.|$|E
60|$|It was {{probably}} the bright hard spring sunshine that emphasized the contrast between that dear England of hedges and homes and the south-west wind in which his imagination lived, and the crude presences of a mechanical age. Never before had the cuttings and heapings, the smashing down of trees, the obtrusion of corrugated iron and tar, the belchings of smoke and the haste, seemed so harsh and disregardful of all the bishop's world. Across the fields a line of gaunt iron standards, abominably designed, carried <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> to some unknown end. The curve of the hill made them seem {{a little out of}} the straight, as if they hurried and bent forward furtively.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Plant organisms, {{bacteria}} and animals (freshwater sponges) have covered (fouled) the sheath of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> in a canal (Mid-Deûle in Lille, north of France).|$|E
50|$|In December 1941 two {{teenagers}} carrying a ladder hit <b>an</b> overhanging <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> killing 16 year old Harold Brindley and badly burning his friend 17 year old John Love and in March 1944 West Ham Stadium switched their racing to Dagenham {{for a short}} time whilst the West Ham track was closed.|$|R
5000|$|Lieutenant Burney {{developed}} explosive paravanes as an anti-submarine weapon, a [...] "high speed sweep". It was a paravane, containing 80 lb of TNT towed by <b>an</b> armoured <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b> The warhead {{was fired}} automatically {{as soon as}} the submarine touched the paravane or towing cable or by hand from the ship's bridge. It could be quickly deployed into the water and towed up to 25 kn, and recovery if unsuccessful was reasonably simple.|$|R
50|$|IFA-2 (also Interconnexion France-Angleterre 2) is <b>a</b> {{proposed}} <b>electric</b> interconnector <b>cable</b> between France and the United Kingdom. The HVDC cable will be 204 km long, {{operating at}} +/-320kV, {{and with a}} capacity to transmit 1,000 MW of power.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} for larger balloon-carried light effects to use tethered balloons, which also can contain <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> power supply: these 'artificial moons' {{may be used for}} floodlighting.|$|E
50|$|Even more doubts remain {{concerning}} Fuchs' death. How {{exactly a}} man without hands (Fuchs consistently refused having his advanced prosthetic arms fitted to him) and under almost constant video surveillance could accomplish the manipulations required to convert <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> into a noose sufficiently robust for successful self-hanging was never properly explained.|$|E
50|$|Bloomfield {{has held}} a post as a magistrate. She is also Chairman of the Pump House Project, an arts and parkour centre {{in her home}} town of Faringdon. She was also, for a time, a partner at the Atlantic Superconnection Corporation, a fund which plans to build <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> between Iceland and the UK.|$|E
5000|$|The stud {{contact system}} is a once-obsolete {{ground-level}} power supply system for electric trams. Power supply studs were set in the road at intervals and connected to <b>a</b> buried <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> by switches operated by magnets on the tramcars. Current was collected from the studs by a [...] "skate" [...] or [...] "ski collector" [...] under the tramcar. The system was popular {{for a while in}} the early 1900s but soon fell out of favour because of the unreliability of the magnetic switches.|$|R
50|$|In {{effect the}} entire {{mechanical}} transmission between the ICE and the wheels is removed {{and replaced by}} <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> generator, some <b>cable</b> and controls, and electric traction motors, with the benefit that the ICE is no longer directly connected to the demand.|$|R
50|$|Modern cars often feature remote {{opening of}} the fuel tank fuel filler flap using <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> motor or <b>cable</b> release. For both {{convenience}} and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from {{the outside of the}} car.|$|R
5000|$|The first portion, [...] "Rust," [...] {{follows a}} group of factory workers in three state-run factories: a {{smelting}} plant, <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> factory and a sheet metal factory. Workers of all three are hindered by sub-standard equipment, hazardous waste, {{and a lack of}} safety precautions. Perhaps even worse, the declining need for heavy industry results in a constant shortage of raw materials, leaving the workers idle and concerned for their future.|$|E
50|$|Explosions, {{conducted}} in Lawachara {{as a part}} of Chevron's survey, are claimed to frighten wildlife, making them leave the forest at an alarming rate. In 7 May 2008, a hoolock gibbon, in an attempt to flee, allegedly died after jumping onto <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b> Damage to residential buildings from the tremors induced by the explosions were also reported, as well as a fire caused by activities of the survey crew. Chevron failed to acknowledge both incidents.|$|E

50|$|RKI {{took steps}} to vigorously protect its {{intellectual}} property. In 1956, RKI sued the National Rural <b>Electric</b> Cooperative Association, <b>an</b> association of cooperative-owned utilities, for trademark infringement. Four years earlier, the organization had introduced Willie Wiredhand, a character with <b>a</b> body of <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> and <b>electric</b> plug feet. On January 7, 1957 the court ruled the characters were different and dismissed the complaint.|$|R
5000|$|Devendra Jhajharia {{was born}} in 1980 in a Jat Family and hails from the Churu District in Rajasthan. At the age of eight, {{climbing}} a tree he touched <b>a</b> live <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b> He received medical attention but the doctors were forced to amputate his left hand. In 1997 he was spotted by Dronacharya Awardee coach R. D. Singh while competing at a school sports day, and from that point was coached by Singh. He gave credit to his personal coach R. D. Singh for 2004 Paralympic Gold Medal, saying: [...] "He gives {{me a lot of}} advice and helps me during training." ...|$|R
50|$|The Nigerian bus {{electrocution}} was a {{road traffic}} {{incident in which}} eleven {{people were killed in}} Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. The incident occurred at approximately 08:00 local time (UTC+1) on 13 February 2010 when <b>a</b> 33 kilovolt <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> snapped, striking two Nissan Urvan buses, and electrocuted many of the occupants. The incident occurred after a severe thunderstorm; the cable was believed to have been brought down by heavy rainfall.|$|R
50|$|In 1888 Georges Head {{was chosen}} as the best place to observe and fire {{underwater}} mines, the latest in harbour defences. Each underwater mine was attached to <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> that ran up the cliff to a firing post. From there, miners watched for ships entering the harbour. The miners' job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship. Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners.|$|E
50|$|New {{varieties}} of ESP can include a water/oil separator which permits {{the water to}} be reinjected into the reservoir without the need to lift it to the surface. There are at least 15 brands of oilfield esps used throughout the world. Until recently, ESPs had been highly costly to install due to the requirement of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> downhole. This cable had to be wrapped around jointed tubing and connected at each joint. New coiled tubing umbilicals allow for both the piping and electric cable to be deployed with a single conventional coiled tubing unit.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{building}} survived {{into the}} 1980s engulfed by an industrial estate constructed {{on the site}} of the former goods depot. It was accidentally damaged in 1980 when a chimney stack was brought down after a tractor-mounted loading shovel became caught up in <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> attached to the chimney. The station building was subsequently moved to [...] on the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway. The goods yard, weighbridge and parcel shed continued to be used by Marriott's coal merchants until May 1995 when they were demolished and subsequently replaced by a Sainsbury's supermarket.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{some issues}} related to optical sensors based on the diffraction method which are used {{as a part of}} the devices to control the outer diameter and eccentricity of <b>a</b> single-core <b>electric</b> <b>cable.</b> The conversion function which allows calculation of the diameter of cylindrical objects regardless of their position in the tested area is considered. The calculations are based on the diffraction method to detect shadow boundaries of the object in two-dimensional optical sensors that use a divergent laser beam. The obtained results can be used to develop precise optical instruments to control the outer diameter and eccentricity of the object in a cable industry...|$|R
40|$|Coldframes and hotbeds {{can help}} the home {{gardener}} in many ways. This NebGuide explains uses, construction, and management. Hotbeds and coldframes are mini-greenhouses in that both use solar energy and sunlight. Coldframes and hotbeds {{can help the}} home gardener start, grow and maintain plant material and the commercial grower propagate and display plant material. The main difference between hotbeds and coldframes is that hotbeds have a supplemental heat source. This supplemental heat source may be organic, such as manure, or non-organic, such as <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> heating <b>cable.</b> Construction can be simple and inexpensive or quite sophisticated. Hotbed/coldframe size can vary...|$|R
