5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt.

500|$|Carradine {{knew nothing}} of the {{practice}} of kung fu {{at the time he was}} cast in the role of Kwai Chang Caine; instead, he relied on his experience as a dancer for the part. He also had experience in sword fighting, boxing, and street fighting on which to draw. For the first half of the original series, David Chow provided technical assistance with kung fu. He never considered himself a master of the art, but rather an [...] "evangelist" [...] of kung fu. By 2003 he had acquired enough expertise in martial arts to produce and star in several instructional videos on T'ai chi and Qigong. In 2005, Carradine visited the Shaolin Monastery in Henan, China as part of the extra features for the third season of the Kung Fu DVDs.

500|$|Only a few {{of those}} in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized {{collapsible}} boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; [...] "In no instance, I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'." [...] Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E

Gerard Gilbert of The Independent was positive in his assessment of the series, stating that [...] "as an avid fan of The Bridge, I <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> report that The Tunnel works well {{in its own right}} – it's intelligently made, well cast and ambitiously cinematic", adding that it had [...] "succeeded in its high-risk strategy of re-working a near-flawless Scandi-drama in our Anglo-French image". Ellen E Jones, also of The Independent, said that Dillane and Poésy's performances [...] "stuck closely" [...] to the original characterisation of the leads from the Scandinavian version. Of the execution, Jones stated: [...] "should you bother watching The Tunnel even if you've already seen the original? The early signs are good. The makers obviously have sense enough to preserve what was effective about the original, and invention enough to distinguish their work too." ...|$|E
