5|$|By early 1933, Bell's {{opinion on}} the NFL had changed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a {{prerequisite}} to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws {{would have to be}} mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Claudia Cardinale met Italian film {{producer}} Franco Cristaldi in 1958. She married him in Atlanta in 1966, but they divorced in 1975. The couple had become increasingly detached <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to remarry without any ties. Although Cardinale {{did not believe}} the Atlanta marriage had any status in Italy, she consented to his request. As a result, Cristaldi married Zeudi Araya and had no further contractual relationships with Cardinale.|$|E

5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break from {{his work on the}} fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E
5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering {{the structure of}} his library soon after taking office, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.|$|E
5|$|Byers, Rechlicz, Stoa, Syner and Wellar {{were all}} re-signed for the 2013–14 season, and Deschamps and LeBlanc {{received}} qualifying offers from the Washington Capitals. It was announced June 14 that Taffe re-signed with the Bears. The Swedish Hockey League had announced one month earlier that Taffe {{had signed a}} contract with them, but Taffe said that announcement had been premature, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep his family in North America. In July, the Bears signed four free agents to one-year contracts: defenseman Tyson Strachan, winger Matt Watkins, forward Derek Whitmore and goaltender David Leggio. For the 2013–14 season, Hershey signed defenseman David Kolomatis, Nate Schmidt, and Jaynen Rissling, as well as goaltender Riley Gill, and forwards Josh Brittain, Dustin Gazley, Brandon Segal, and Jamie Johnson, a former linemate of Taffe's with the Rochester Americans.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist {{who had worked with}} Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale {{his choice}} of any {{property}} the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to make {{something other than a}} war picture. While the novel itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to an unknown actor named Boris Karloff. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E

Cam asks Luke (Nolan Gould) to be the broadcaster of the game, since Reuben is sick. Just before the game starts, Cam and his players learn that the coach of the opponent team has died {{and they are going to}} play in his memory.

5|$|Tod favoured the then-fashionable {{concept of}} Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, {{he thought that}} each princely state should be {{inhabited}} by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful {{in both of these}} endeavours.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to re-establish stability {{as quickly as}} possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 {{that there had been}} no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
5|$|By late April, {{the war was}} {{effectively}} over. On 1 May 1945, Galland attempted {{to make contact with}} United States Army forces to negotiate the surrender of his unit. The act itself was dangerous. SS forces roamed the countryside and towns executing anyone who was considering capitulation. The Americans requested that Galland fly his unit and Me 262s to a USAAF controlled airfield. Galland declined citing poor weather and technical problems. In reality, Galland was not going to hand over Me 262 jets to the Americans. Galland had harboured the belief that the Western Alliance would soon be at war with the Soviet Union, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to join American forces and to use his unit in the coming war to free Germany from Communist occupation. Galland replied, making his whereabouts known to the Americans, and offering his surrender once they arrived at the Tegernsee hospital where he was being treated. Galland then ordered his unit, which had then moved to Salzburg and Innsbruck, to destroy their Me 262s. At the time of his surrender, Galland had filed claims for 104 Allied aircraft shot down. His claims included seven with the Me 262.|$|E

5|$|He again {{excelled in}} {{basketball}} his senior year, leading {{his team to}} the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, {{and he was not}} interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, Walker spoke by {{telephone}} with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command, in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter {{and said the}} most serious threat was along {{the boundary between the}} U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E
