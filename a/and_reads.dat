5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm <b>and</b> <b>reads</b> the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} explored the metacognitive reading strategies used by university {{students and the}} correlation between metacognitive reading strategies (Global, Problem-Solving, <b>and</b> Support <b>reading</b> strategies) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. Specifically, the objectives of this research are four-folds, namely to identify metacognitive reading strategies used by the students during reading, to find the correlation between Global Reading Strategies (GLOB) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, to find the correlation between Problem-Solving Reading Strategies (PROB) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>and</b> to find the correlation between Support Reading Strategies (SUPP) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. A survey on metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies <b>and</b> a <b>reading</b> comprehension test were administered to identify students’ metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies <b>and</b> comprehension performance. The subjects were 31 students of English Department at a university in Surabaya. The findings revealed that students preferred to use PROB reading strategies the most, followed by GLOB <b>reading</b> strategies, <b>and</b> SUPP <b>reading</b> strategies. This finding on prime preferences indicates that students {{had a tendency to}} concentrate and monitor their comprehension, particularly when they had difficulties in doing the reading test. In terms of correlation, the findings revealed that (1) a positive, moderate (at. 66) correlation between GLOB strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, (2) a positive, strong correlation (at. 72) between PROB strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>and</b> (3) a positive, weak correlation (at. 26) between SUPP strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. In general, the overall correlation between metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension was positive and strong at. 79. The aforementioned correlation results tell us that students whose metacognitive reading awareness was high performed better in their reading comprehension than students whose metacognitive reading awareness was low...|$|R
