5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band.

Two small openings above the <b>aortic</b> <b>valve</b> carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E

5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the <b>aortic</b> <b>valve</b> for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveWhether {{patients}} with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> are susceptible {{not only to}} ascending aortic dilatation but also to dilatation of the remaining aorta is uncertain. This study evaluated the possible correlation between ascending aortic dilatation and dilatation of the remaining aorta in {{patients with}} bicuspid and tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves,</b> respectively. MethodsThe entire aortas of 97 patients (bicuspid in 62, tricuspid in 35) undergoing replacement of the ascending aorta because of ascending aortic pathology (78 with and 19 without concurrent valve pathology) were preoperatively evaluated using computed tomography scanning. ResultsAortic dimensions distal to the ascending aorta were smaller in patients with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> than in patients with tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> (P . 2). ConclusionsPatients with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> and dilatation of the ascending aorta consistently had smaller dimensions of the remaining aorta compared with patients with tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves.</b> Concomitant dilatation of the descending aorta was predominantly found in patients with tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

Congenitally defective <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> showed increasing amounts of calcification, a lowering of total AMPS content, and an alteration in the relative proportions of various AMPS with advancing age, as compared with age-matched normal <b>aortic</b> <b>valves.</b> The total AMPS content of rheumatic <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> from individuals under the age of 21 years was found to be significantly higher than that of age-matched normal controls. In addition, these rheumatic <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> showed an alteration in AMPS composition that was similar to that of congenitally defective <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> obtained from older individuals.

5|$|Two {{additional}} semilunar valves sit at {{the exit}} {{of each of the}} ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located {{at the base of the}} pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar <b>aortic</b> <b>valve</b> is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.|$|E

He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the <b>aortic</b> <b>valve</b> by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveMatrix metalloproteinases are endopeptidases that {{function}} in cell matrix turnover. Abnormal matrix metalloproteinase activity has {{been implicated in}} the formation of atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms. Recent studies suggest that abnormal matrix metalloproteinase activity may also be associated with the formation of atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic thoracic aortic aneurysms. Bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> are associated with an intrinsic aortic pathology that predisposes to formation of proximal thoracic aneurysms while tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> are not. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the activities of matrix metalloproteinases and levels of their inhibitors in thoracic aneurysms of patients with bicuspid and tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves.</b> MethodsEndogenous and total activity of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 were measured in proximal nonatherosclerotic thoracic aortic aneurysms of 16 patients with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> and 12 patients with tricuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves.</b> Levels of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase- 1 and - 2 were also measured. Results were standardized to total protein (mg). ResultsTotal matrix metalloproteinase- 2 activity was greater in aneurysms associated with bicuspid valves when compared with those from tricuspid valves (43 ± 11 ng/mg vs 14 ± 2 ng/mg, P =. 02). Total matrix metalloproteinase- 9 activity was also greater in aneurysms associated with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> (4. 0 ± 0. 9 vs 1. 5 ± 0. 3, P =. 02). There was no meaningful difference between groups in levels of tissue inhibitor- 1 and - 2. ConclusionThe increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases in the walls of aneurysms associated with bicuspid <b>aortic</b> <b>valves</b> may partly explain the predilection to aneurysm formation in these patients...|$|R

His relationship with Torres is strained when he confronts her about sleeping with Sloan, but he allows her to support him through his father's deteriorating health. Complications from his father's surgery leave him in multi-system organ failure, and his life support is turned off. In an attempt to overcome his grief, O'Malley elopes with Callie to Las Vegas. He later begins to feel that he was mistaken to marry her, and sleeps with Stevens while intoxicated.

However, he is ineligible to transfer after failing the intern exams. O'Malley decides to repeat his intern year, and confesses to Torres that he slept with Stevens, leading the two to separate.

25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the <b>aortic</b> <b>valve,</b> so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt.

The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the <b>aortic</b> <b>valve</b> preventing proper valve closure.|$|E
