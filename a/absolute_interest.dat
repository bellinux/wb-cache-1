5000|$|The first essay, which {{discusses}} {{ancient and}} modern tragedy, is called the [...] "Ancient Tragical Motif as Reflected in the Modern". Once again he is writing about the inner and the outer aspects of tragedy. Can remorse be shown on a stage? What about sorrow and pain? Which is easier to portray? He also discusses guilt, sin, fear, compassion, and responsibility in what {{can be considered a}} foreshadowing of Fear and Trembling and Repetition. He then writes a modern interpretation of Antigone which leads into The Concept of Anxiety. [...] Draw nearer to me, dear brothers of Symparanekromenoi; close around me as I send my tragic heroine out into the world, as I give the daughter of sorrow a dowry of pain as a wedding gift. She is my creation, but still her outline is so vague, her form so nebulous, that each one of you is free to imagine her as you will, and each one of you can love her in your own way. She is my creation, her thoughts are my thoughts, and yet it is as if I had rested with her in a night of love, as if she had entrusted me with her deep secret, breathed it and her soul out in my embrace, and as if in the same moment she changed before me, vanished, so that her actuality could only be traced in the mood that remained, instead of the converse being true, that my mood brought her forth to a greater and greater actuality. I placed the words in her mouth, and yet it is as if I abused her confidence; to me, it is as if she stood reproachfully behind me, and yet it is the other way around, in her mystery she becomes ever more and more visible. She is my possession, my lawful possession, and yet sometimes it is as if I had slyly insinuated myself into her confidence, as if I must constantly look behind me to find her, and yet, on the contrary, she lies constantly before me, she constantly comes into existence only as I bring her forth. She is called Antigone. This name I retain from the ancient tragedy, which for the most part I will follow, although, from another point of view, everything will be modern. Either/Or Part I, Swenson, p. 151 [...] That which in the Greek sense affords the tragic interest is that Oedipus’ sorrowful destiny re-echoes in the brother’s unhappy death, in the sister’s collision with a simple human prohibition; it is, so to say, the after effects, the tragic destiny of Oedipus, ramifying in every branch of his family. This is the totality which makes the sorrow of the spectator so infinitely deep. It is not an individual who goes down, it is a small world, it is the objective sorrow, which, released, now advances in its own terrible consistency, like a force of nature, and Antigone’s unhappy fate, an echo of her fathers, is an intensified sorrow. When, therefore, Antigone in defiance of the king’s prohibition resolves to bury her brother, we do not see in this so much a free action on her part as a fateful necessity, which visits the sins of the fathers upon the children. There is indeed enough freedom of action in this to make us love Antigone for her sisterly affection, but in the necessity of fate there is also, as it were, a higher refrain which envelops not only the life of Oedipus but also his entire family. Either/Or Part I, Swenson, p. 154Kierkegaard may have been responding to what Hegel wrote about [...] "divine commands and the State and country and community and Freedom and Reason".Subjective volition Passion is that which sets men in activity, that which effects" [...] practical" [...] realization. The Idea is the inner spring of action; the State is the actually existing, realized moral life. For it is the Unity of the universal, essential Will, with that of the individual; and this is “Morality." [...] The Individual living in this unity has a moral [...] "life; possesses a value that consists in this substantiality alone. Sophocles in his Antigone, says, [...] "The divine commands are not of yesterday, nor of to-day; no, they have an infinite existence, and no one could say whence they came." [...] The laws of morality are not accidental, but are the essentially Rational. It is the very object of the State that what is essential in the practical activity of men, and in their dispositions, should be duly recognized; that it should have a manifest existence, and maintain its position. It is the <b>absolute</b> <b>interest</b> of Reason that this moral Whole should exist; and herein lies the justification and merit of heroes who have founded states, however rude these may have been. In the history of the World, only those peoples can come under our notice which form a state. For it must be understood that this latter is the realization of Freedom, i.e. of the absolute final aim, and that it exists for its own sake. It must further be understood that all the worth which the human being possesses all spiritual reality, he possesses only through the State. For his spiritual reality consists in this, that his own essence Reason is objectively present to him, that it possesses objective immediate existence for him. Thus only is he fully conscious; thus only is he a partaker of morality of a just and moral social and political life. For Truth is the Unity of the universal and subjective Will; and the Universal {{is to be found in}} the State, in its laws, its universal and rational arrangements. The State is the Divine Idea as it exists on Earth. We have in it, therefore, the object of History in a more definite shape than before; that in which Freedom obtains objectivity, and lives in the enjoyment of this objectivity. For Law is the objectivity of Spirit; volition in its true form. Only that will which obeys law, is free; for it obeys itself; it is independent and so free. When the State or our country constitutes a community of existence; when the subjective will of man submits to laws, the contradiction between Liberty and Necessity vanishes. The Rational has necessary existence, as being the reality and substance of things, and we are free in recognizing it as law, and following it as the substance of our own being. The objective and the subjective will are then reconciled, and present one identical homogeneous whole.* Lectures on the History of History Vol 1 p. 40-41 John Sibree translation (1857), 1914 ...|$|E

The role of aerosol particles is considered crucial for air quality, meteorological and climatical purpose. Several studies show that the aerosol physical and chemical behaviours affect the atmospheric radiative budget by scaterring and aborbing the radiative fluxes. Moreover, it has also been shown that the physical and chemical description of the aerosol is necessary to give shape to water droplets. Finally, several reports from the World Health Organisation show that the fine aerosol particles can cause major diseases as cancer or pulmonary diseases, and should be now considered as a public health matter. This study takes place in this context, and aims at estimating the radiative feedbacks of urban aerosol on the boundary layer. The CAPITOUL field experiment, which took place in the city of Toulouse during one year from march 2004 to february 2005, is the framework of a modelling study during a 2 -day IOP. First, an emission inventory has been set up to reproduce the gaz and particles emissions. Then, a simulation exercise aims at reproduce the aerosol evolution at the fine scale of 500 m, and the very specific spatial distribution at different resolutions. In order to estimate the impact of aerosol particles on radiation, a radiative module has been developped to compute online the aerosol optical properties depending on the complex aerosol physical and chemical parameters. The radiative fluxes are then impacted by the aerosol scaterring and aborbing behaviour, leading to change in the urban dynamics. Those feedbacks on radiative fluxes lead to a change of the boundary layer's temperature. The impacts are also compared to the urban surface impact...|$|E

Left cranio-caudal mammograms were digitized using a Kodak Lumisys 85 scanner (Kodak, Rochester, New York, USA) and were then viewed on a computer screen. In brief, a trained reader first defines the total breast area using an outlining tool, and the software estimates {{the total number of}} pixels in the breast (total breast area). Next, a reader defines a region of interest in the breast that contains all the densities, but that excludes the pectoralis muscle, prominent veins, fibrous strands and other light artifacts. The reader then uses a tinting tool to apply a yellow tint to dense pixels within the region of interest that have grey levels at or above some threshold and below a pixel value of 255. The reader searches for the best threshold where all pixels within the region of interest are considered to represent mammographic densities. The software estimates the number of tinted pixels within the region of <b>interest</b> (<b>absolute</b> density).

On the other hand, an implementation of the involvement of the taxpayer and interaction with him through a protective approach of “liberty of choice” within a responsively organized set of rules (Part III, Towards an idea of liberty in the “Fiscal State”: Models of Taxpayers’ Choices in view of new horizons of a respectful approach and of the customer satisfaction). In this context, what emerges is the fundamental relationship between the Taxpayer’s Ombudsman and Tax Authorities in view of reaching both a valuable protection of taxpayers’ rights, and the achievement of models to be applied, with the taxpayer’s choice being taken into consideration (TCM Model 2012 - 2013). ...|$|R
50|$|Roland was Alan's despicable father-in-Law {{with whom}} B'Stard had to curry favour {{if he wanted}} to retain his seat due to Roland {{controlling}} the local Conservative Party. In some ways similar to Sir Greville, Roland is a much older but equally nasty version of B'Stard, albeit with an apparently genuine interest in the constituency. On several occasions, Roland threatens to have Alan de-selected due to the <b>absolute</b> lack of <b>interest</b> B'Stard displays in Haltemprice. Roland chastises B'Stard for not holding surgeries, not asking questions in the House and taking no interest in local industry and claims his control over the local Party is a perfect miniature of Thatcher's Cabinet and gives him the power to wreck B'Stard's career. Despite these seemingly genuine concerns for his locality, Roland on many occasions demonstrates his thorough nastiness. It is revealed that as the young Master of Ingleborough Colliery in 1926, he was prepared to use mustard gas on his workers to stave off the threat of revolution then dumped the gas under a primary school. He was even prepared to let B'Stard dump nuclear waste in the same location for the right price. Roland is particularly unpleasant towards the French (which he puts down to an unpleasant experience with a French woman called Giselle in 1940, the last time he touched anything French) and swears he will never use words again if he discovers them to have French origin. Roland also reveals his sinister nature by stating he turned down the chance to have Leon Brittan as MP for Haltemprice due to him being Jewish, asking for anything South African (South Africa at this time being under Apartheid) and Sarah later reveals that he knew Hitler socially although they never discussed politics. Roland is seen in only series 1 but after Alan's shooting Sarah is seen on the phone to her father, the two of them asking each other if they were responsible for the crime.|$|R
5000|$|His name is {{most widely}} known in {{connection}} with {{his work on the}} liquefaction of the so-called permanent gases and his researches at temperatures approaching <b>absolute</b> zero. His <b>interest</b> in this branch of physics and chemistry dates back {{at least as far as}} 1874, when he discussed the [...] "Latent Heat of Liquid Gases" [...] before the British Association. In 1878, he devoted a Friday evening lecture at the Royal Institution to the then-recent work of Louis Paul Cailletet and Raoul Pictet, and exhibited for the first time in Great Britain the working of the Cailletet apparatus. Six years later, again at the Royal Institution, he described the researches of Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski, and illustrated for the first time in public the liquefaction of oxygen and air. Soon afterwards, he built a machine from which the liquefied gas could be drawn off through a valve for use as a cooling agent, before using the liquid oxygen in research work related to meteorites; about the same time, he also obtained oxygen in the solid state.By 1891, he had designed and built, at the Royal Institution, machinery which yielded liquid oxygen in industrial quantities, and towards the end of that year, he showed that both liquid oxygen and liquid ozone are strongly attracted by a magnet. About 1892, the idea occurred to him of using vacuum-jacketed vessels for the storage of liquid gases - the Dewar flask (otherwise known as a Thermos or vacuum flask) - the invention for which he became most famous. The vacuum flask was so efficient at keeping heat out, it was found possible to preserve the liquids for comparatively long periods, making examination of their optical properties possible. Dewar did not profit from the widespread adoption of his vacuum flask - he lost a court case against Thermos concerning the patent for his invention. While Dewar was recognised as the inventor, because he did not patent his invention, no way to stop Thermos from using the design was possible.|$|R
2500|$|The next {{session was}} the {{definite}} one; either they {{would continue to}} work with the group or break up their relationship. Wilson recalled, [...] "Every previous time we'd met up with the girls we had prepared a backing track. This time we had nothing." [...] Watkins also said, [...] "They said they wanted to do something up and a bit of fun, so we just off the top of our heads started {{to come up with a}} full-on disco backing track, which became 'Who Do You Think You Are'." [...] Wilson said of the song, [...] "The thing is when they wrote it, they were also writing the dance routine, constructing the music video, all at the same time as writing the song. And that's when the penny dropped." [...] The girls went on to write [...] "Something Kinda Funny", [...] "Last Time Lover" [...] and [...] "Naked" [...] with Watkins and Wilson, none of them singles, but all of them tracks which lent a touch of classy R feel to the Spice album. Absolute also produced all of these songs as well as the two tracks penned with Eliot Kennedy: [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] and [...] "Love Thing" [...] giving the duo a guiding hand in six of the ten tracks that eventually ended up on Spice. The tracks that Absolute produced were recorded for the most part at Olympic Studios in Barnes. At this time, 1995, the Auto-Tune facility had yet to come to the market and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards. Absolute told Simon Fuller about the group they had worked with and asked whether he would consider managing them. Fuller received a demo of [...] "Something Kinda Funny", one of the songs the group wrote with <b>Absolute.</b> He showed <b>interest</b> in the group, began a relationship and decided to sign them at 19 Management in March 1995. In September 1995 the group signed a deal with Virgin Records, and continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific in November.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION] Like {{the terms}} 'dialectic', 'Aufhebung' (or 'sublation'), and 'Geist', the term 'concrete universal' has a distinctively Hegelian ring to it. But unlike these others, it is {{particularly}} associated with the British strand in Hegel's reception history, as having been brought to prominence {{by some of the}} central British Idealists. It is therefore perhaps inevitable that, as their star has waned, so too has any use of the term, while an appreciation of the problematic that lay behind it has seemingly vanished: if the British Idealists get any sort of mention in a contemporary metaphysics book (which is rarely), it will be Bradley's view of relations or truth that is discussed, not their theory of universals, so that the term has a rather antique air, buried in the dusty volumes of Mind from the turn of the nineteenth century. This is not surprising: the episode known as British Idealism can appear to be a period that is lost to us, in its language, points of historical reference (Lotze, Sigwart, Jevons), and central preoccupations (the <b>Absolute).</b> Even while <b>interest</b> in Hegel continues to grow, interest in his Logic has grown more slowly than in the rest of his work, with Book III of the Logic remaining as the daunting peak of that challenging text - while it is here that the British Idealists focussed their attention and claimed to have uncovered that 'exotic' but 'vanished specimen', the concrete universal. Finally, as the trend of reading Hegel pushes ever further in a non-metaphysical direction, it might be thought that the future of the concrete universal is hardly likely to be brighter than its recent past - for it may seem hard to imagine how a conception championed by the British Idealists, who were apparently shameless in their metaphysical commitments, can find favour in these more austere and responsible times. In this paper, however, I want to make a case for holding that there is something enlightening to be found in how some of the British Idealists approached the 'concrete universal', both interpretatively and philosophically. At the interpretative level, I will argue that while not everything these Idealists are taken to mean by the term is properly to be found in Hegel, their work nonetheless relates to a crucial and genuine strand in Hegel's position, so that their discussion of this issue is an important moment in the reception history of his thought. At a philosophical level, I think that the question that concerned Hegel and these British Idealists retains much of its interest, as does their shared approach to it: namely, how far does our thought involve a mere abstraction from reality, and what are the metaphysical and epistemological implications if it turns out it does not? As such, I will suggest, taking seriously what these British Idealists have to say about the concrete universal can help us both in our understanding of Hegel, and in our appreciation of the contribution Hegel's position can make to our thinking on the issues that surround this topic. ...|$|R
