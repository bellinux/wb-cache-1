5|$|In {{some places}} they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion {{as well as}} the {{associated}} maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of <b>animal</b> <b>feces,</b> and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary pig {{production}} requires high demand on breeding {{large number of}} animals/pigs in a relatively small space while attaining maximum productivity. Their productivity is related to their health and ever-growing concern about less use of antibiotics in {{pig production}}. Measures {{have been taken to}} prevent diseases rather than cure them. Biosecurity measures prevent entry of pathogens into farm and their transmission between buildings. There are many critical points that must be taken care of: location, workers, farm entrance, breeding progeny, semen, transport animals, food, dead <b>animals,</b> <b>feces,</b> waste water, DDD, biosecurity in buildings etc. Standardized rules of biosecurity on farms need to be strictly followed to maintain high production...|$|R

25|$|Pica is most {{commonly}} seen in pregnant women, small children, {{and those with}} developmental disabilities such as autism. Children eating painted plaster containing lead may suffer brain damage from lead poisoning. There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before tetraethyllead in petrol was phased out (in some countries) or before people stopped using contaminated oil (containing toxic PCBs or dioxin) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, {{there is also a}} much greater risk of gastro-intestinal obstruction or tearing in the stomach. Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of <b>animal</b> <b>feces</b> and accompanying parasites. Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs.|$|E
25|$|E. imperialis {{typically}} feed on nectar from flowering plants, {{particularly of}} the orchid species. Studies {{have shown that}} the nectar intake rate for E. imperialis is determined primarily by nectar viscosity rather than nectar sweetness, as measured by sucrose concentrations. E. imperialis also visits a wide variety of deep flowering plants, unreachable to most other bee species, such as Bignoniaceae, Costaceae, and Marantaceae, as well as understorey herbs such as Costus laevis and Costus allenii, which are entirely dependent on female E. imperialis for pollination and cross-fertilization. Male euglossines have also been observed to collect chemical fragrances from floral sources—such as Orchidaceae, Solanaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Euphorbiaceae—as well as non-floral sources, including decaying wood, rotting fruit, <b>animal</b> <b>feces,</b> and tree wounds.|$|E
25|$|C. tetani usually {{enters a}} host through a {{wound to the}} skin, then it replicates. High risk {{individuals}} are people exposed to soil or <b>animal</b> <b>feces.</b> The spores are widely distributed in soil and in the intestines and feces of horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. Manure-treated soil may contain large numbers of spores. In agricultural areas, {{a significant number of}} human adults may harbor the organism. The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin. Once an infection is established, C. tetani produces two exotoxins, tetanolysin and tetanospasmin. Eleven strains of C. tetani have been identified, which differ primarily in flagellar antigens and in their ability to produce tetanospasmin. The genes for toxin production are encoded on a plasmid which is present in all toxigenic strains, and all strains that are capable of producing toxin produce identical toxins.|$|E

50|$|Spirometra is a genus of Pseudophyllid cestode that reproduces in canines and felines {{but which}} can cause {{pathology}} in humans. As an adult, this tapeworm lives in the small intestine of its definitive host and produces eggs that pass with the <b>animal's</b> <b>feces.</b> The eggs hatch into coracidia which are eaten by copepods which become infected themselves. In the copepod, the worm forms a procercoid, which is infective to vertebrates that ingest them. Often, because the copepods are so small, vertebrates ingest copepods accidentally by drinking them. In the vertebrate, the worms enter the plerocercoid stage. The plerocercoids pass through several paratenic hosts before reaching a suitable definitive host where it can mature. Once eaten by a canid or felid, the tapeworm matures and begins producing eggs. Theoretically, a canid or felid that ate an infected human could become infected.|$|R
500|$|Other {{bacteria}} {{found on}} lettuce include Aeromonas species, {{which have not}} been linked to any outbreaks; Campylobacter species, which cause campylobacteriosis; and Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia kristensenii (species of Yersinia), which have been found mainly in lettuce. Lettuce {{has been linked to}} numerous outbreaks of the bacteria [...] and Shigella; the plants were most likely contaminated through contact with <b>animal</b> <b>feces.</b> A 2007 study determined that the vacuum cooling method, especially prevalent in the California lettuce industry, increased the uptake and survival rates of E. coli O157:H7. Salmonella bacteria, including the uncommon Salmonella braenderup type, have also caused outbreaks traced to contaminated lettuce. Viruses, including hepatitis A, calicivirus and a Norwalk-like strain, have been found in lettuce.

2500|$|European {{immigrant}} beer brewers in {{the early}} 20th century had their own campaign against the native pulque, claiming that pulque producers used a muñeca (doll), a textile bag containing human or <b>animal</b> <b>feces</b> which {{was placed in the}} aguamiel to hasten the fermentation process. Some pulque producers have insisted that the muñeca is completely a myth, but modern historians suggest that it did happen, although only rarely. Beer producers promoted the idea that pulque was generally made this way, generally by word of mouth and insinuation. This was done to inhibit pulque sales and to promote the consumption of beer, which they claimed was [...] "rigorously hygienic and modern".|$|E
40|$|Paratuberculosis is an {{infectious}} disease which affects ruminants. In this work, a sheep flock in Garfagnana district (Tuscany, Italy) was examined by agar gel immune-diffusion (AGID) tests, culture, and PCR from feces, milk, tissue samples, and cheeses. At the first AGID test, 7 / 280 (2. 5 %) animals were positive. From these <b>animals,</b> <b>feces</b> and milk samples were collected: 4 / 7 feces (57. 14 %) and 2 / 7 milk samples (28. 57 %) were positive to culture and 7 / 7 (100 %) feces samples and 1 / 7 milk samples (14. 28 %) were positive to PCR; 2 / 4 (50 %) cheeses ripened for 14 days and 1 / 3 (33. 33 %) cheese ripened for 20 days were positive to PCR, from which no viable microorganisms were isolated.

The numbers of viable microbial cells extracted from the dumpsite project site atmosphere ranged between 64 cfu/ 15 minutes and 16 cfu/ 15 minutes for bacteria, 39 cfu/ 15 minutes and 1 cfu/ 15 minutes for coliforms and; between 77 cfu/ 15 minutes and 13 cfu/ 15 minutes for fungi. The values remarkably higher than results reported for other human-impacted projects in the tropics. Bacillus sp was 100 % prevalence followed by E. coli with 80 % prevalence. The fungal genera such as Absidia, Mucor, Penicillium, Aspergillus restrictus and Cladosporium showed 60 % prevalence in the study area. The predominant fungi characterized from the old stadium project atmosphere were Absidia, Mucor, Penicillium, Aspergillus restrictus,Candida pseudotropicalis and Cladosporium; while Micrococcus, Bacillus and Staphylococcus species were the predominant bacteria species found in the project environment. Escherichia coli (faecal coliform) and S. aureus as microorganisms do not survive well in aerosols, the two isolates were predominantly detected at the dumpsite and its immediate environment, {{an indication that the}} project site and its environ are heavily impacted by humans and <b>animals</b> <b>feces</b> and wastes or that fecal wastes are also wrongly discharged at the open dumpsite...|$|R
