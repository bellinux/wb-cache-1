5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating.</b> The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

The remains of the crew then fell some 200,000 feet to earth, where they were also subjected to burning from <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating.</b> The official NASA report omitted {{some of the more}} graphic details on the recovery of the remains, however witnesses reported various gruesome finds such as a human heart and parts of femur bones.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that a comet {{was responsible for}} the Tunguska Meteor Fall is rejected because the hypothesis does not seem to account for the intense terminal spherical shock. A porous meteoroid model is proposed, and an analysis indicates that an entity of this type might produce an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heat</b> flux large enough to account for the terminal meteor explosion. It is suggested that the presence of olivine and of highly irregular macrostructure in meteors might indicate the presence of some porosity. For a highly porous meteoroid, it is postulated that during entry into the atmosphere the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heat</b> transfer at its external or pore walls would become so intensified as to cause either complete ablation with popping or a solid-liquid-vapor phase transition accompanied by an explosion...|$|R

25|$|Vehicles {{in orbit}} have {{large amounts of}} kinetic energy. This energy must be {{discarded}} if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating.</b> The theory behind reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle and the heat energy instead {{ends up in the}} atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The Ames Arc Jet Complex is an {{advanced}} thermophysics facility where sustained hypersonic- and hyperthermal testing of vehicular thermoprotective systems takes place under {{a variety of}} simulated flight- and re-entry conditions. Of its seven available test bays, four currently contain Arc Jet units of differing configurations, serviced by common facility support equipment. These are the <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>Heating</b> Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the Panel Test Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF). The support equipment includes two D.C. power supplies, a steam ejector-driven vacuum system, a water-cooling system, high-pressure gas systems, data acquisition system, and other auxiliary systems.|$|E
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E

The required acceleration required a new solid fuel mixture that burned ten {{times as fast as}} contemporary designs such as the Pershing or Minuteman. The burning fuel and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> together created so much heat that radio signals were strongly attenuated through the resulting ionized plasma around the missile body. It was expected that the average interception would take place at about [...] at a range of [...] after 10 seconds of flight time.|$|E
500|$|Three {{minutes after}} the count was resumed, the hatch {{installation}} was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, {{which was part of}} the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>heating</b> during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust {{in the event of a}} launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at , [...] higher than atmospheric pressure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnitude}} and capacity {{of these systems}} makes the Ames Arc Jet Complex unique in the world. The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage steam ejector vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, {{is one of the}} highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW HÃ¼ls arc heater and can test samples [...] in size. The <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>Heating</b> Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, samples sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. Catalycity studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a HÃ¼ls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.|$|E
