5|$|In 1926, Parker Brothers Inc. republished The Mansion of Happiness in its {{original}} form, with minor modification to game spaces. The game included the circular end space introduced by J. Bufford in the third edition. This sixth edition used a folding game board with <b>a</b> <b>fabric</b> and cardboard pocket on the back edge of the game board. The teetotum was made using a wood dowel and cardboard hexagon.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Chinese Buddhist {{accounts}} from the mula-sarvastivadin monastic order (or vinaya) present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an arhat Indian Buddhist missionary {{by the name}} of Madhyântika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop. From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as <b>a</b> <b>fabric</b> dye.|$|E
5|$|Various {{conflicting}} accounts {{exist that}} describe saffron's first arrival in South and East Asia. The {{first of these}} rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire. Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron {{was used in the}} treatment of melancholy and as <b>a</b> <b>fabric</b> dye.|$|E

5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of <b>a</b> <b>fabric</b> made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> {{nonwoven}} <b>fabric</b> {{has been}} widely used in geotextile engineering in recent years; its tensile strength is an important behaviour. Since the fibre distributions in nonwoven fabrics are random and discontinuous, the unit-cell model of <b>a</b> nonwoven <b>fabric</b> cannot be developed to simulate its tensile behaviour. This article presents our research on using finite element method (FEM) to study the tensile behaviour of <b>a</b> nonwoven <b>fabric</b> in macro-scale based on the classical laminate composite theory. The laminate orientation was considered with orientation distribution function of fibres, which has been obtained by analysing the data acquired from scanning electron microscopy with Hough Transform. The FE model of <b>a</b> nonwoven <b>fabric</b> was developed using ABAQUS software; the required engineering constants of <b>a</b> nonwoven <b>fabric</b> were obtained from experimental data. Finally, the nonwoven specimens were stretched along with machine direction and cross direction. The experimental stress-strain curves were compared {{with the results of}} FE simulations. The approximate agreement proves the validity of an FE model, which could be used to precisely simulate the stress relaxation, strain creep, bending and shear property of <b>a</b> nonwoven <b>fabric...</b>|$|R

25|$|Both {{fabric and}} {{neoprene}} drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: <b>a</b> <b>fabric</b> drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, {{they are quite}} bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if <b>a</b> <b>fabric</b> drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, {{but in some cases}} do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a degree of insulation.|$|E
