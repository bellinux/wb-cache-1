5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E

25|$|The Great War was <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> affair, but post-war dream seemed {{secure in}} the Roaring Twenties. The United Farmers of Ontario won the most seats in the 1919 provincial {{election}} and formed a coalition government with the Independent Labour Party. Walter Rollo, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Hamilton West, became the first Ontario Minister of Labour in this government.|$|E
25|$|Li {{took on a}} {{more serious}} role in the 2005 film, Unleashed (a.k.a. Danny the Dog), where he portrayed an adult with the mentality {{of a child who}} has been raised like an animal. Although his martial arts skills were used extensively, it was <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> film with more depth than had been {{previously}} seen in Li's films, and co-starred dramatic actors Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman.|$|E
25|$|The statue is cast {{in bronze}} and stands upon a square stone base with {{inscriptions}} on each side. The figure {{is that of}} a lone Confederate soldier, who stands facing south with his arms crossed. His wide-brimmed hat is clasped in his right hand and he is looking down toward the ground with <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> expression on his face. The soldier is facing south, {{the general direction of the}} battlefields of the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Picard {{wakes up}} {{on the bridge of}} the Enterprise to {{discover}} that while he perceives many decades have transpired, only 25 minutes have passed. The now inactive probe is brought aboard the Enterprise and the crew finds a small box within it. <b>A</b> <b>somber</b> Riker gives the box to Picard, who opens it to find Kamin's flute. Picard, now adept at the instrument, plays the melody he learned during his life as Kamin.|$|E
25|$|At the betrothal {{celebrations}} Nikiya performs <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> dance {{while playing}} her veena. She is then given {{a basket of}} flowers which she believes are from Solor, and begins a frenzied and joyous dance. Little does she know that the basket is from Gamzatti, who has concealed beneath the flowers a venomous snake. The bayadère then holds the basket too close and the serpent bites her on the neck. The High Brahmin offers Nikiya {{an antidote to the}} poison, but she chooses death rather than life without her beloved Solor.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, enlisted {{ranks in}} the Rhodesian Army wore <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> khaki drill. The Battle of Sinoia and the {{outbreak}} of the Rhodesian Bush War prompted security forces to devise a more appropriate uniform especially designed for the region. This incorporated a three colour, high contrast, disruptive fabric with green and brown strokes on a sandy background. Early shortages of textile and equipment were overcome with South African and Portuguese technical assistance, and a home industry for the new battledress developed. The pattern was supposedly designed by Di Cameron of David Whitehead Textiles.|$|E
50|$|Something for the Rest of Us was {{released}} on August 31, 2010. While the album was full of the pop-rock that has sustained the band for decades, lead singer/guitarist Rzeznik's songwriting took on <b>a</b> more <b>somber,</b> serious tone.|$|R
5000|$|Ryuji {{from the}} book was a snarky wisecrack who enjoyed black humour, and even claimed to have raped three girls. Ryuji from the film was <b>a</b> stoical, <b>somber</b> grouch, and there was never {{anything}} in the movie about rape.|$|R
25|$|In <b>a</b> more <b>somber</b> tradition, Samuel Nicholas's {{grave in}} the Arch Street Friends Meeting {{graveyard}} in Philadelphia is {{marked with a}} wreath at dawn {{by a group of}} Marines annually on 10 November to celebrate his role in the founding of the Corps.|$|R
25|$|The Clan Ranald {{is one of}} {{the most}} tragic and unique shipwrecks in Australian waters. It {{represents}} one of the worst shipwrecks in Australian history with a massive loss of life. Combined with the grave sites of the officers and the crew in the nearby Edithburgh Cemetery, the Clan Ranald is <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> reminder of a huge tragedy. For this reason, the wreck site and the event itself is very important to the community of the lower Yorke Peninsula, not only because of the disastrous loss of life, but also because they played a major role in aiding the survivors. Even to this day, if you visit the graves, there are fresh flowers near the headstones.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2015, Schroeter's {{remains were}} escorted from Greenwood Memorial Park {{to the new}} (dedicated 2010) Miramar National Cemetery by Patriot Guard Riders. The {{following}} day, July 9, 2015, <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> military ceremony took place as Schroeter was reburied with full military honors. A horse-drawn hearse carried his remains with an honor guard of thirty soldiers from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Irwin, California. Also present were flag bearing Patriot Guard Riders, two living Medal of Honor recipients, Civil War re-enactors, and an Army band with a few military and cemetery officials providing their respects. Standing in for the family, Douglas Ledbetter, Director of Miramar National Cemetery, was presented the American flag that covered Schroeter's remains.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{inspired}} by an idea originally created for Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories series. Unlike other LucasArts adventure games, which typically included {{a good deal of}} humor, The Dig took <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> approach to its science fiction motif. In the game, the player takes the role of Commander Boston Low, part of a five-man team planting explosives on an asteroid in order to avert its collision course with Earth. Discovering the asteroid is hollow, Low and two of his team are suddenly transported to a long-abandoned complex, filled with advanced technology, on a strange alien world. Low and his companions must utilize xenoarchaeology to learn how the technology works, discover the fate of the alien race that built it, and solve other mysteries {{to find a way to}} return home.|$|E
60|$|The afternoon's {{experiences}} {{had certainly}} been remarkable--a strange mixture {{of pain and}} pleasure, not blending into homogeneous gray, but resembling rather a bright embroidery on <b>a</b> dark, <b>somber</b> ground; and of these surprising contrasts I was destined to have more that same evening.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> hundred <b>somber</b> {{eyes turned}} on the prisoners. Except that one wore a {{buckskin}} coat, the other a linsey one, there was no difference. The strong figures were the same, the white faces alike, the stern resolve in the gray eyes identical--they were twin brothers.|$|R
50|$|Lassan (Hungarian for slowly) or more {{properly}} lassú (slow) is the slow {{section of the}} csárdás, a Hungarian folk dance, or of most of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies, which take their form from this dance. It generally either has <b>a</b> dark, <b>somber</b> tone or <b>a</b> formal, stately one.|$|R
25|$|It also re-established Sakuraba's {{proficiency}} {{in dealing with}} larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride's next event, this time to decide Pride's inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba locked on a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by a slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone. Not willing {{to let him go}} on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.|$|E
25|$|The joyous {{celebration of}} February takes on <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> mood as the liturgical {{calendar}} {{moves on to}} Cuaresma or Lent. In Santa Maria, the solemn commemoration begins not on Palm Sunday but a week before that. The Church of La Purisima Concepcion holds the annual Solemne Septenario or seven-day devotion in honor of La Virgen Esperanza. It ends on Viernes de Dolores or the Friday before Palm Sunday. The highlight of the feast is the Misa Pontifical followed by the besamanos or kissing of the Virgin's hand {{in the morning and}} the Procession of the Virgen Macarena under palio in the evening which is known as Via Matris. During this procession, the Virgin makes seven stops to specific houses and high up on a balcony, a tenor and a soprano sing the dialogue of Christ and the Virgin. They are assisted by a choir and a brass band.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{produced}} by Toru Takahashi. The director was Yōichi Take, who co-wrote the scenario with Akira Yasui. According to Take, the scenario had <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> tone to suit its setting despite not being fatalistic, and was quite brief {{when compared to other}} video game narratives. The character of Alicia was described as a combination of Japanese and Western character archetypes; while her Gothic witch appearance drew from Western fiction, her melancholy persona and ironic humor were based in Japanese traditions. The character designs and art direction were handled by Satoshi Ueda. The menus and other 2D assets were designed by Satoko Tsushima. Tsushima also designed the game's logo. The in-game cinematics were directed by Yasui. The higher graphical power of the console enabled a greater degree of character expression than Yasui's previous work. The creature designs were handled by Taro Hasegawa. One monster he described in detail was the humanoid Geist, which he needed to redesign several times; his first draft was refused due to being overly complex to render, with later versions being created with input from other staff members. The larger monsters dubbed Megas were designed around the concept of players jumping on them during battle, but due to hardware limitations this aspect of gameplay was cut. The game's monsters, like Alicia, were a fusion of Western and Japanese design elements. Fuji Wahara was in charge of character motion, and worked hard to make character movements realistic while keeping to the exaggerated tone and style of the game. The lead artificial intelligence designer was Tomoyuki Ando.|$|E
5000|$|The Dancing Exercise: <b>a</b> weird, <b>somber</b> {{sequence}} of steps and retreats.

2500|$|From 1896 to 1905, the {{football}} program {{was in a}} state of flux, with a new coach taking over the reins every year. Injuries and the untimely death of the Ohio University quarterback, on the field, in December 1898, was <b>a</b> <b>sombering</b> event, with severe injuries often taking place in early collegiate football as uniforms of the era provided little physical protection. [...] The coaches during this time period included Frank Remsberg, Warwick Ford, Peter McLaren, Fred Sullivan, Karl Core, Art Jones, Henry Hart, Joseph Railsback, and Harold Monosmith, with Sullivan being coach in both 1899 and 1903. [...] The best records of this time period were forged in 1897 and 1901 under Warwick Ford and Art Jones, respectively. [...] The 'Cats were 7–2 in their 1897 campaign, and posted a 6–1–2 record in 1901.|$|R

25|$|In 1999, Valdobrev was {{approached}} by director Stefan Komandarev to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, Dog's Home. Valdobrev composed both the film score and the words and music for six songs, performed {{by some of the}} most prominent contemporary alternative rock bands. The released Original Soundtrack was actually the first ever released Bulgarian movie soundtrack. It {{turned out to be a}} great success. The pilot single Is it me, or is it not? performed by Stefan Valdobrev and featuring his friend and colleague Arabel Karajan became one of the film songs classics. The film’s score earned Valdobrev the Golden Rose for a film debut at the 2000 National Film Awards ceremony. Two years later Komandarev and Valdobrev teamed up again in Komandarev’s second documentary film Alphabet of Hope. Their collaboration resumed with the director’s 2009 hit The World Is Big and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner, based on the best-selling novel by the German author Ilija Trojanow and featuring Miki Manojlovic in the lead role. Both the film and the soundtrack were very successful. The film received numerous international awards and nominations, reaching the Oscars' Foreign Language Films' Shortlist. During the same period Valdobrev started to span his work on mainly European projects. Since 2008 he has provided the music for fiction and documentaries like the Czech films Kulicky (2008), Killing the Czech Way (2010) and Love in the Grave (2012), the Norwegian Can You Talk? (2011) and the Slovenian State of Shock (2011). In 2013 he started to create the score for the Bulgarian National Television series The Ungiven, <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> drama that tells the story of the saving of 48,000 Bulgarian Jews in the years of the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|Despite his vilification by {{contemporary}} historians, Domitian's administration provided {{the foundation for}} the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from his. Much more than a [...] "gloomy coda to the...1st century", the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign that Theodor Mommsen described as <b>a</b> <b>somber</b> but intelligent despotism.|$|E
50|$|The final {{movement}} {{is the shortest}} movement of the concerto. It is in rondo form, featuring an episode in the dominant key of A major and <b>a</b> more <b>somber</b> digression in D minor. The work ends with a rather cheerful affirmation, less overtly virtuosic than its sister C Major Cello Concerto.|$|R
5000|$|... "Moon Crying" [...] carried <b>a</b> very <b>somber</b> tone {{about missing}} a {{deceased}} loved one {{and not knowing}} how to move on.
