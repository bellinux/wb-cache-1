5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires gene transcription <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry.

40|$|Using gold {{electrodes}} lithographically fabricated onto microscope cover slips, DNA <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> are interrogated both optically (through fluorescence) and electronically (through conductance measurements). Dielectrophoresis is used {{to position}} DNA <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> at well-defined positions on a chip. For the electronic manipulations, quadrupole electrode geometries are used with gaps ranging from 3 to 100 m; AC field strengths are typically 10 6 V/m with frequencies between 10 kHz and 30 MHz. Nanoparticles (20 nm latex beads) are also manipulated. A technique of in situ impedance monitoring is tested {{for the first time}} to measure the conductance of the electronically manipulated DNA <b>and</b> <b>proteins.</b> The electrical resistance of DNA <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> is measured to be larger than 40 M under the experimental conditions used...|$|R

40|$|Many genes <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> are {{required}} {{to carry out the}} processes of innate and adaptive immunity. For many studies, including systems biology, it is necessary to have a clear and comprehensive definition of the immune system, including the genes <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> that take part in immunological processes. We have identified and cataloged {{a large portion of the}} human immunology-related genes, which we call the essential immunome. The 847 identified genes <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> were annotated, <b>and</b> their chromosomal localizations were compared to the mouse genome. Relation to disease was also taken into account. We identified numerous pseudogenes, many of which are expressed, and found two putative new genes. We also carried out an evolutionary analysis of immune processes based on gene orthologs to gain an overview of the evolutionary past and molecular present of the human immune system. A list of genes <b>and</b> <b>proteins</b> were compiled. A comprehensive characterization of the member genes <b>and</b> <b>proteins,</b> including the corresponding pseudogenes is presented.
