30|$|The task of <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> {{detection}} in surveillance video generally comprises three stages: The {{first stage}} localizes candidate <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> {{items in the}} video. The second stage locates and tracks the luggage owner(s), providing a trajectory for subsequent probabilistic reasoning. The final stage assesses a probability or confidence score for the luggage-abandonment event based on information obtained during previous stages. The three stages all represent distinct research areas with their own rich literature. Various existing algorithms may employ different methods for different stages.|$|E
50|$|The {{opening of}} the {{alternate}} history fiction writer Harry Turtledove's novel Hitler's War, in his series The War That Came Early, begins with Sanjurjo's flight from Portugal. The point of divergence is that he accepts the pilot's advice and <b>abandons</b> the <b>luggage,</b> the flight no longer being overloaded and thus arriving safely. His behaviour {{from that point on}} is described as if he diverged from that of the actual Franco, with Spain taking a less isolated role in World War II.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of people}} in tunnel fires shows many similarities to that in other types of buildings. The recognition, response/pre-egress activities, and evacuation stages apply in both cases; a person's role has a major effect on the behaviour they will exhibit, and people cluster in family, social or ad-hoc groups. Communication between people occurs throughout the incident, {{in order to raise}} the alarm, and give instructions/directions to the exits. Pre-egress activity includes similar actions to those performed in building fires, e. g., investigation, fire-fighting, searching for, warning and rescuing others. Rapidly-worsening conditions in tunnel fires may however reduce the options available to people. During evacuation, people usually head away from the fire, although they may often find themselves moving through smoke. Tunnel portals (“familiar ” routes) will be preferred to side exits unless directions to the contrary are given, or smoke/darkness leaves no choice. Some differences from other building fires are that drivers are very reluctant to abandon their vehicles, and in rail tunnels, passengers are reluctant to <b>abandon</b> their <b>luggage...</b>|$|R

The port was supposedly defended by the Portuguese cruiser Adamastor, but the governor, Colonel Tómas de Sousa Rosas, was intent on using the ship to simply evacuate himself and his <b>luggage,</b> <b>abandoning</b> the harbour and its stockpiles and supply facilities to the German forces. Commander Boyes resolved to stand and fight with the Thistle and her small crew, an action which shamed Sousa Rosas and Adamastor into holding their ground, thus dissuading the Germans from an attack. This act of determination earned Boyes the Portuguese Order of Aviz.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a localized approach for detecting <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> in surveillance environments. Through foreground-mask sampling, only {{the object of}} interest is localized, while filtering out all irrelevant, interfering agents. Tracking thus can be performed in a more selective and localized manner. An improved implementation of the HT for detecting {{the contours of the}} upper-body is also proposed for use in tandem with skin color detection. These techniques make <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> detection become a real-time system, which can run at 17.37 frames per second on average.|$|E
30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is as follows. First, this paper proposes the foreground-mask sampling to localize the candidates of <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> items by calculating the intersection of a number of background-subtracted frames which are sampled over a period of time. <b>Abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> items are assumed to be static foreground objects, and thus appear in this intersection. Since this approach requires no prior learning of luggage appearance in any form, luggage of all shapes, sizes, orientations, viewing angles and colors can be successfully localized without the need for training data and associated constraints.|$|E
30|$|During {{the first}} stage of the system, the foreground-mask {{sampling}} attempts to localize static and possibly <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> items within the camera view. This technique imitates the natural human ability to focus attention exclusively on objects of interest. The algorithm identifies the objects (in this case <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> items) via logical foreground-background reasoning, while ignoring all irrelevant objects within the same scene. The appearance-based model is not used in locating suspicious luggage items, and thus can deal with luggage of any color and shape and is not affected by different viewing angles.|$|E

40|$|Many {{public or}} open areas are {{facilitated}} with cameras at every angle {{to monitor the}} security of that area for keeping the citizens safe, which {{is known as the}} surveillance system.

30|$|The actual {{implementation}} uses a cache {{mechanism to}} store {{the information from the}} previous backtracking. When the system needs to repeat back-tracking around a single <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> item, the system needs only to update some of the stored information. For example, if two 30 -second back-tracks overlap by 20 [*]seconds, the information regarding the first 20 [*]seconds of the second back-tracking can be directly obtained from the last 20 [*]seconds of the first back-tracking, which is cached in the system. Overheads associated with recollecting thus are eliminated. This mechanism provides sufficient computational reduction in the back-tracking procedure and guarantees real-time performance on live streaming surveillance videos.|$|E

3000|$|... {{is set to}} 30 [*]seconds {{based on}} the {{assumption}} that when an isolated luggage item is first detected in a scene, its owner must have been in close proximity to the item until shortly before detection. This assumption is valid because if the owner has been absent for some time, the isolated luggage item will be detected faster using the foreground-mask sampling technique. Furthermore, owners who abandon their luggage with criminal intention would generally want to avoid attention and thus are unlikely to loiter; instead they will remain constantly with their luggage prior to abandonment. Therefore, in the case in which multiple people surround the <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage,</b> the person closest to the luggage is assumed to be the owner.|$|E
30|$|The AVSS 2007 dataset {{contains}} {{three cases}} with different difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. The easy case contains objects with larger appearance, activities {{closer to the}} camera and less scene clutter; as the difficulty level raises, objects shrink and clutter increases. The proposed approach successfully detects the <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> in all three cases. The owner in the easy case is tracked continuously until leaving the scene without his luggage, triggering an alarm event. In the medium and hard cases, the owners pass behind a large pillar before leaving the scene without their luggage, and both are occluded for about 1.5 [*]seconds. The proposed tracking engine is unable to follow the owner through the occlusion, and thus the owner is deemed lost; therefore alarms are also triggered in these two cases.|$|E

It uses probability theory to provide a consistent framework for dealing with uncertain knowledge for the recognition of complex events. We validate the event recognition accuracy of the proposed algorithm on real-world videos.

30|$|The {{first stage}} of {{locating}} candidate <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> items within the video frame is performed using two types of techniques: those that utilize the technique of background subtraction [6 – 8], {{and those that do}} not [9, 10]. As generally acknowledged, object detection and recognition is an instinctive and spontaneous process for human visual system. However, implementing a robust and accurate computer vision system capable of detecting relevant objects in monitored areas has proved challenging. The main difficulty is the appearance of an object can vary significantly due to viewpoint changes, scene clutter, ambient lighting changes, and in some cases even shape changes (for nonrigid objects such as human body). Consequently, the same object may present enormously different images under various viewing conditions. Background subtraction works reasonably well when the camera is stationary and the change in ambient lighting is gradual. For those approaches without background subtraction, a set of discriminative features of objects must be learned through machine-learning algorithms to enable subsequent detection of these objects.|$|E
40|$|With rapidly {{increasing}} deployment of surveillance cameras, the reliable methods for automatically analyzing the surveillance video and recognizing special events are demanded by different practical applications. This paper proposes a novel effective framework for security event analysis in surveillance videos. First, {{convolutional neural network}} (CNN) framework is used to detect objects {{of interest in the}} given videos. Second, the owners of the objects are recognized and monitored in real-time as well. If anyone moves any object, this person will be verified whether he/she is its owner. If not, this event will be further analyzed and distinguished between two different scenes: moving the object away or stealing it. To validate the proposed approach, a new video dataset consisting of various scenarios is constructed for more complex tasks. For comparison purpose, the experiments are also carried out on the benchmark databases related to the task on <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> detection. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and effective in recognizing complex security events...|$|E
3000|$|Papers 1 – 4 mainly {{address the}} issues of human object detection, {{segmentation}} and tracking. The paper by Conte et al., entitled [...] "An experimental evaluation of foreground detection algorithm in real scenes," [...] conducts a thorough experimental comparison of four notable foreground detection algorithms, using quantitative performance indices on a large dataset of videos covering several realistic applicative scenarios. This paper concludes that both mixture of Gaussians (MOG) and enhanced background subtraction (EBS) algorithms are quite versatile {{and can be used}} effectively in most situations. The self-organizing background subtraction (SOBS) algorithm gives good results in indoor environments but can have some problems in outdoor settings. Finally, statistical background algorithm (SBA) is consistently inferior to the others, so its adoption is not advisable. The paper by Ahn et al., entitled [...] "Automatic moving object segmentation from video sequences using alternate flashing system," [...] jointly considers sensitivity, color, coherence, and smoothness for segmentation. The proposed algorithm employs a flashing system to obtain a series of lit and unlit frames from a single camera. By comparing the unlit and lit frames, a sensitivity map which provides depth cues can be constructed. Moreover, real-time segmentation can be achieved with an acceleration mechanism. The paper by Chang et al., entitled [...] "Localized detection of abandoned luggage," [...] explores the automatic detection of <b>abandoned</b> <b>luggage</b> by using foreground-mask sampling to detect luggage with arbitrary appearance and selective tracking to track owners. More specifically, the object of interest is localized through foreground-mask sampling, which enables tracking to be performed in a more selective and localized manner. The detected foreground region is checked to determine whether it is a human via a combination of skin color information and body contours. If the region is identified as a human, the region is discarded. If not, it is assumed to be a luggage item. A local search region is constructed around the detected luggage to see whether its owner is in close proximity in the current frame. If the owner is found, the region is again discarded because the owner exhibits no intention of abandoning the luggage. The paper by Wu et al., entitled [...] "A hierarchical estimator for object tracking," [...] integrates local and global estimates into one joint estimate for mutual compensation. A feedback loop is implemented to achieve iterative optimization and gain improvement from both the local and global mutual compensation. Such integration allows the tracker to adjust fusion gain optimally based on the environment conditions and therefore to obtain higher tracking accuracy.|$|E
