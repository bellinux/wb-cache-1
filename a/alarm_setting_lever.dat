40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the experiments reported here was to demonstrate the effects of opening up the design envelope for auditory alarms {{on the ability of}} people to learn the meanings of a <b>set</b> of <b>alarms.</b> Two <b>sets</b> of <b>alarms</b> were tested, one already extant and one newly-designed set for the same set of functions, designed according to a rationale set out by the authors aimed at increasing the heterogeneity of the <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> and incorporating some well-established principles of alarm design. For both <b>sets</b> of <b>alarms,</b> a similarity-rating experiment was followed by a learning experiment. The results showed that the newly-designed set was judged to be more internally dissimilar, and easier to learn, than the extant set. The design rationale outlined in the paper is useful for design purposes in a variety of practical domains and shows how alarm designers, even at a relatively late stage in the design process, can improve the efficacy of an <b>alarm</b> <b>set.</b> © 2011 Elsevier B.

A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory.

Later stemwind movements were <b>lever</b> <b>setting,</b> with a unique design of <b>set</b> <b>lever</b> which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out.

50|$|A {{fire alarm}} system {{has a number of}} devices working {{together}} to detect and warn people through visual and audio appliances when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors, and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations. Alarms can be either motorized bells or wall mountable sounders or horns. They can also be speaker strobes which sound an alarm, followed by a voice evacuation message which warns people inside the building not to use the elevators. Fire alarm sounders can be set to certain frequencies and different tones including low, medium and high, depending on the country and manufacturer of the device. Most {{fire alarm system}}s in Europe sound like a siren with alternating frequencies. Fire alarm sounders in the United States and Canada can be either continuous or set to different codes such as Code 3. Fire alarm warning devices can also be set to different volume levels. Smaller buildings may have the <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> to a lower volume and larger buildings may have <b>alarms</b> <b>set</b> to a higher level.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} systems {{that can be}} modeled as directed acyclic graphs such that nodes represent components {{of the system and}} directed edges represent fault propagation between components. Some components can be equipped with alarms that ring when they detect faulty (abnormal) behavior. We study algorithms that attempt to minimize the number of alarms to be placed so that a fault at any single component can be detected and uniquely diagnosed. We first show that the minimization problem is intractable, i. e., NP-hard, even when restricted to three level graphs in which all nodes have outdegree two or less. We present optimal algorithms for three special classes of graphs – tree structured graphs, single-entry single-exit series–parallel graphs and two level graphs. We then present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the general case which guarantees that the ratio of the number of alarms placed to the optimum required is within a factor that is logarithmic in the number of nodes in the graph. Moreover, by showing a reduction from the minimum dominating set problem to the minimum <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> problem, we argue that this performance guarantee is tight to within a constant factor. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between the minimum <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> problem and the minimum test collection problem, and prove similar results...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the rate of compliance with hospital guidelines for alarm limits for pulse oximetry in preterm infants on oxygen therapy. METHODS. All infants admitted to the nurseries at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with gestational age < 32 weeks or birth weight < 1500 g between August 2005 and February 2006 were eligible for inclusion. Data on the <b>alarm</b> limits <b>set</b> for infants on oxygen therapy were collected prospectively. The target saturation range recommended in written hospital guidelines was 88 % to 92 %, with <b>alarm</b> limits <b>set</b> at 85 % and 94 %. RESULTS. Data were prospectively collected for 144 subjects with mean (SD) gestational age 29. 3 (2. 4) weeks and birth weight 1226 (354) g; 1073 alarm limits were collected when infants were on oxygen. The lower <b>alarm</b> limit was <b>set</b> correctly 91. 1 % of the time. In contrast, the upper <b>alarm</b> limit was <b>set</b> correctly only 23. 3 % of the time: 76. 5 % of the time it was too high, and 23. 8 % of the time it was set at 100 %. Infants with an upper <b>alarm</b> limit <b>set</b> correctly on a particular day had a significantly lower birth weight, gestational age, postmenstrual age, and postnatal age than infants who had the upper <b>alarm</b> limit <b>set</b> too high. Use of assisted ventilation, higher inspired oxygen concentrations, and more frequent changes in inspired oxygen concentration were all associated with improved odds of having an appropriately <b>set</b> upper <b>alarm</b> limit. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that current guidelines regarding the upper pulse oximeter alarm limit for infants receiving oxygen might be commonly exceeded, although compliance might be better for infants at higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, there might be less variation from guidelines for the lower alarm limit...|$|R

40|$|Several {{variables}} are usually recorded on line in Intensive Care Units (ICU) to detect {{changes in a}} patientís state. Current alarm systems are based on fixed thresholds, generating many false alarms. This paper presents a filtering alarm system developed to reduce these false alarms, without missing any true alarm. A vital physiological variable, the oxygen saturation rate signal (SpO 2) is taken as an example. The filtering alarm system is started when the threshold based <b>alarm</b> system <b>sets</b> off an <b>alarm.</b> A multivariable analysis of the other monitored physiological variables is carried out on a fixed temporal window preceding the alarm, using change indices calculated from the physiological variables trend. These indices are aggregated using fuzzy decision making tools and allow classifying the alarm in ìtrueî or ìfalseî. The system was tested on 45 hours of data recorded every second on adult patients hospitalized in ICU. Results show that 31 out of the 35 false <b>alarms</b> <b>set</b> off by the classical system are filtered and no true alarm is missed, out of 45 ones...|$|R
