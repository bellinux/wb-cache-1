40|$|This report {{details the}} process of {{updating}} the Web-based <b>airport</b> <b>economic</b> impact calculator and the calculation of the statewide economic impact of Minnesota’s public airports. The end products of these efforts are: 1) an economic impact calculator that more adequately reflects current economic conditions with added flexibility to handle large, unique airport operations 2) and {{an estimate of the}} total economic impact of Minnesota’s airports in 2009. The <b>airport</b> <b>economic</b> impact calculator prompts users to enter data on nine main types of <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> to calculate the impact of their local airport. These include: public airport operations and capital investments, fixed based operators (FBOs), commercial scheduled air service, retail businesses, general aviation, freight operators, private corporations with flight departments, non-profit and government entities and other activities. The newly updated economic impact calculator allows for greater variability in the size and scale of these airport operations and contains new economic impact coefficients that reflect changes in the economy since the calculator was first developed. These nine activities also contribute to the economy of Minnesota. To calculate the economic impact of the airport system in Minnesota, primary data were collected from airport mangers, FBO’s, corporate flight departments and governmental units. Secondary data were obtained from Minneapolis-St. Paul International, Rochester International, and Duluth International airports to provide a comprehensive economic impact analysis for the state...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade many major U. S. {{airports}} have encountered extensive opposition to plans for future growth and expansion from environmentalists and community groups who cite the noise and air pollution created {{and the use of}} increasingly scarce land resources. In an effort to counterbalance these criticisms and highlight the regional benefits the airport provides, several airport authorities have completed economic impact studies which attempt to define the airport's role in the regional economy. In reviewing the <b>airport</b> <b>economic</b> impact studies which have been completed in the past twenty years, it is obvious that a wide range of methodologies have been developed to accomplish the common task of estimating the different elements of <b>airport</b> <b>economic</b> impact. This thesis provides an overview and critical evaluation of the techniques used in past studies to define what is the <b>airport</b> <b>economic</b> impact and how is the impact estimated in the absence of primary data. Three major economic impact categories, primary, direct and induced, provide the framework for analysis.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{financial}} asset returns are predictors of future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> is widespread, but detailed analyses provide little support for financial markets ability to reveal future <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Even though {{the evidence on}} various indicators used by different researchers is mixed, {{the authors of this}} article explore the notion that financial markets reveal useful information about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> This article examines and answers two questions: First, what is a good way of extracting information about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> from asset prices? Second, do financial asset returns help predict <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> over horizons from one month to five years? To determine whether news of an assets excess return can reveal information about unexpected <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> the authors construct a method of extracting the news about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> from returns on financial assets.
