40|$|AbstractA {{non-contact}} flowrate measurement {{using the}} air-coupled ultrasound beam focusing technique {{is applied to}} the flowrate measurement in aluminum pipe. Flowrate measurement in the <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> by the air-coupled ultrasonic flowmeter has difficulty, because of the multipath of ultrasonic propagation. Bulk wave and guided wave are separated by experiment using <b>metal</b> <b>pipes</b> with and without an obstacle. The algorism for signal separation is built for the <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> measurement. Flowrate is calculated by the signal of bulk wave. Accordingly, the flowrate measurement on the aluminum pipe has been demonstrated, and the result shows the capability of measurement in <b>metal</b> <b>pipes</b> using air-coupled ultrasound...|$|R

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>pipes</b> are {{generally}} made by first casting the desired lead alloy onto a long flat surface. Once the metal cools, it is cut into pieces, {{which are then}} rolled into shapes around molds called mandrels and soldered together. Thus, the cross-section of a <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> is usually circular. The low melting point, solderability and malleability of the organ metal makes the construction of pipes relatively easy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we extend {{the theory of}} Radio Frequency (RF) {{propagation}} {{as it relates to}} propagation within <b>metal</b> circular <b>pipes.</b> This work is motivated by a need to understand the operation of UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems when the tags are placed within the pipes. These circular pipes are shown to be similar to metal tube waveguides which are hollow. We derive the Bessel function that is used to identify the propagation constants, the different transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes, cut-off frequencies and the multimode attenuation. These parameters are used within the theory to identify operating limitations of passive RFID systems in hollow <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> A comprehensive general theory is developed to enumerate the workings of passive RFID systems in circular <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> Analytical evaluations are used to visualise the tags within the <b>metal</b> <b>pipes</b> and to validate the theory presented in this paper...|$|R

Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed <b>metal</b> <b>pipe</b> would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.|$|R

For the double <b>metal</b> composite <b>pipe</b> stress, displacement and stress of drill tooth plate, influence of slip teeth plate on the double <b>metal</b> composite <b>pipe</b> damage was analyzed, The plastic damage law of the double <b>metal</b> composite <b>pipe</b> was obtained with the influence factor of the contact surface and the influence factor of the tooth crown width. the analysis showed that, The double <b>metal</b> composite <b>pipe</b> can be clamped and the contact area value of the tooth plate with the minimum damage are fixed.

40|$|Surface cracks {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as a major cause for potential failures of <b>metal</b> <b>pipes.</b> In fracture analysis, the widely used method is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. However, for ductile <b>metal</b> <b>pipes,</b> it has been known {{that the existence of}} plasticity results in easing of stress concentration at the crack front. This will ultimately increase the total fracture toughness. Therefore, when using linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict fracture failure of ductile <b>metal</b> <b>pipes,</b> the plastic portion of fracture toughness should be excluded. Otherwise, the value of fracture toughness will be overestimated, resulting in an under-estimated probability of failure. This paper intends to derive a model of elastic fracture toughness for steel pipes with a circumferential crack. The derived elastic fracture toughness is a function of crack geometry and material properties of the cracked pipe. The significance of the derived model is that the well-established linear elastic fracture mechanics can be used for ductile materials in predicting the fracture failur...|$|R
