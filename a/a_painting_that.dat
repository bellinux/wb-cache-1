5|$|In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was {{immediately}} {{preceded by a}} number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Maria Portinari {{is a small}} c. 1470–72 tempera and oil on wood {{painting}} by Hans Memling. It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is aged about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel studded necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> may have been partly based on Memling's portrait.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E
5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1885, the Círculo de Trabajadores {{organization}} {{concentrated on}} educational and cultural activities, hosting a secular school for 500 poor students and meetings for workers' groups. The next year, {{leaders of the}} Círculo (with Enrique Creci at the head) formed an aid committee {{to raise funds for}} the legal troubles of eight Chicago anarchists who had been charged with murder in connection with the Haymarket affair. Within a month and a half, the committee had raised approximately US$1,500 for the cause. In addition, a few days prior to the anarchists executions, the Círculo organized a demonstration of 2,000 people in Havana to protest the state's decision to execute the Americans. The Círculo and El Productor were both fined - the paper for an editorial written by Roig San Martín about the executions, and the Círculo for displaying <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> commemorated the execution. The colonial government also prohibited the demonstrations that would be held every year on anniversary of the execution.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{learning}} {{that the young}} emperor of Brazil, Dom PedroII, sought a wife, {{the government of the}} Two Sicilies offered the hand of Teresa Cristina. It also sent PedroII <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> greatly embellished the princess, which prompted him to accept the proposal. A proxy wedding was held on 30 May 1843 in Naples, PedroII being represented by his fiancée's brother Prince Leopold, Count of Syracuse. A small Brazilian fleet composed of a frigate and two corvettes departed for the Two Sicilies on 3 March 1843 to escort the new Empress of Brazil. She arrived on Rio de Janeiro on 3 September 1843. PedroII immediately rushed to board the ship and greet his bride. Upon seeing this impetuous gesture, the crowds cheered and guns fired deafening salutes. Teresa Cristina {{fell in love with her}} new husband at first sight.|$|E

25|$|The {{name of the}} {{movement}} is the title of <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> Kandinsky created in 1903, but {{it is unclear whether}} it is the origin of the name of {{the movement}}, as Professor Klaus Lankheit learned that the title of the painting had been overwritten. Kandinsky wrote 20 years later that the name is derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of riders, combined with a shared love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art).|$|E
25|$|Ruskin {{came into}} contact with Millais after the artists {{approached}} him through their mutual friend Coventry Patmore. Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's Christ in the House of His Parents (1849–50), <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the PRB to The Times in May 1851. Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at Glenfinlas, he painted the closely observed landscape background of gneiss rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's portrait.|$|E
25|$|School of the Art Institute of Chicago student David Nelson created Mirth & Girth, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> {{depicted}} Washington wearing women's lingerie {{and holding}} a pencil, which was briefly displayed in a hallway at the school on May 11, 1988. City aldermen {{and members of the}} Chicago Police Department soon seized the painting then later returned it with a five-inch gash on the canvas. Nelson, assisted by the ACLU, subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. The complainants eventually split a US$95,000 (1994, US$138,000 in 2008) settlement from the city.|$|E

25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E
25|$|The photorealist painter Marcus Beilby won the 1987 Sir John Sulman Prize with <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> also depicts shearers at work, {{this time}} in a modern shed using machine shears with {{overhead}} gear. Beilby was consciously inspired by Shearing the Rams when creating his own updated version, and gave his work the name Crutching the ewes to differentiate it, {{despite the fact that}} it does not depict men crutching sheep but rather shearing them. The impact of Shearing of Rams can also be seen in Australian cinema. Shots of a shearing shed in The Squatter's Daughter (1933) bear a strong resemblance to the one in the painting. The cinematography of the Australian New Wave film Sunday Too Far Away (1975), set on an outback sheep station, was heavily influenced by Shearing the Rams, among other Australian paintings. The work inspired New Zealand author Stephen Daisley to write his 2015 historical novel Coming Rain.|$|E
500|$|Deal got {{the idea}} for the album's name from <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> she saw in Boston. Pods cover was {{designed}} by Vaughan Oliver with photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, and performed a fertility dance while Westenberg took pictures of him, using a long exposure. Oliver's inspiration included the need for [...] "a strong male response" [...] (via the [...] "phallic" [...] eels) to the music of the mostly female Breeders. Another motivation was his attempt to charm Kim Deal, and speak to her sense of humor, as he had become enamored with her.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} is signed J.Ingres Pinxit 1832 in capitals {{at the top}} left, and L.F. Bertin, also in capitals, at the upper right. The frame is the original, and {{thought to have been}} designed by Ingres himself. It shows animals around a sinuous and richly carved grapevine. Art historians Paul Mitchell and Lynn Roberts note that the design follows an old French tradition of placing austere male portraits within [...] "exuberantly carved" [...] frames. The frame closely resembles that of Raphael's c. 1514–15 Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione, <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> influenced Ingres, especially in colour and tone.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> came to {{be known}} as the Flower {{portrait}} was discovered, inscribed with the date 1609 and painted on an authentic 17th-century panel. It was initially widely accepted as the original work from which Droeshout had copied his engraving, but in 1905 the art scholar Marion Spielmann demonstrated that the portrait corresponded to [...] the second state of Droeshout's print. Taking the view that if it were the source, the first state would be closest, he concluded that it was a copy from the print. In 2005 chemical analysis proved the portrait to be a 19th-century fake painted over an authentic 17th-century image.|$|E

After the battle the Munsters once again assembled at the Rue de Bois, though only three officers and 200 men were found fit to parade. [...] Rickard's widow, Jessie Louisa Rickard, requested that war artist Fortunino Matania immortalise the parade at Rue de Bois in <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>that</b> centred on Gleeson delivering the absolution (Rickard is also depicted in the background). Gleeson later donated the stole he wore for the parade to the regimental museum.|$|E
