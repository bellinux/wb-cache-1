40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{economically}} design an optimum carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) flood for a mature waterflood nearing its economic abandonment. The original project utilized advanced reservoir characterization and CO{sub 2 } horizontal injection wells as the primary methods to redevelop the South Cowden Unit (SCU). The development plans; project implementation and reservoir management techniques were {{to be transferred to}} the public domain to assist in preventing premature abandonment of similar fields. The Unit was a mature waterflood with water cut exceeding 95 %. Oil must be mobilized {{through the use of a}} miscible or near-miscible fluid to recover significant additional reserves. Also, because the unit was relatively small, it did not have the benefit of economies of scale inherent in normal larger scale projects. Thus, new and innovative methods were required to reduce investment and operating costs. Two primary methods used to accomplish improved economics were use of reservoir characterization to restrict the flood to the higher quality rock in the unit and use of horizontal injection wells to cut investment and operating costs. The project consisted of two budget phases. Budget Phase I started in June 1994 and ended late June 1996. In this phase Reservoir Analysis, Characterization Tasks and Advanced Technology Definition Tasks were completed. Completion enabled the project to be designed, evaluated, and an <b>Authority</b> <b>for</b> <b>Expenditure</b> (AFE) for project implementation submitted to working interest owners for approval. Budget Phase II consisted of the implementation and execution of the project in the field. Phase II was completed in July 2001. Performance monitoring, during Phase II, by mid 1998 identified the majority of producing wells which under performed their anticipated withdrawal rates. Newly drilled and re-activated wells had lower offtake rates than originally forecasted. As a result of poor offtake, higher reservoir pressure was a concern for the project as it limited CO{sub 2 } injectivity. To reduce voidage balance, and reservoir pressure, a disposal well was therefore drilled. Several injection surveys indicated the CO{sub 2 } injection wells had severe conformance issues. After close monitoring of the project to the end of 1999, it was evident the project would not recover the anticipated tertiary reserves. The main reasons for under-performance were poor in zone CO{sub 2 } injection into the upper San Andres layers, poorer offtake rates from newly drilled replacement wells and a higher than required reservoir pressure. After discussion internally within Phillips, externally with the Department of Energy (DOE) and SCU partners, a redevelopment of South Cowden was agreed upon to commence in year 2000. The redevelopment essentially abandoned the original development for Budget Phase II in favor of a revised approach. This involved conformance techniques to resolve out of zone CO{sub 2 } injection and use of horizontal wells to improve in zone injectivity and productivity. A phased approach was used to ensure short radius lateral drilling could be implemented effectively at South Cowden. This involved monitoring drilling operations and then production response to determine if larger investments during the second phase were justified. Redevelopment Phase 1 was completed in May 2000. It was deemed a success in regard to finding suitable/cost-effective technology for drilling horizontal laterals and finding a technique that could sustain long-term productivity from the upper layers of the San Andres reservoir. Four existing vertical producing wells were isolated from their existing completions and sidetracked with horizontal laterals into the upper layers of the San Andres. Overall average offtake rates for the four wells increased by a factor of 12 during the first four months after completion of Phase 1. Phase 2 of the redevelopment focused on current CO{sub 2 } vertical injection wells. Techniques were applied to resolve near well conformance concerns and then either single or dual laterals were drilled in the upper layers. Additional work required conformance resolution with a horizontal injection well and additional lateral drilling from four existing producing wells. Although Phase 1 had provided a short-term boost to lease offtake, it was Phase 2, by ensuring in zone CO{sub 2 } injection in all existing vertical wells, which would provide the longer-term reserve recovery from the upper San Andres. Phase 2 activities commenced in October 2000 with drilling a single lateral in an existing CO{sub 2 } injector. Four dual lateral and one single lateral CO{sub 2 } injection wells were completed from existing wellbores to replace the poorly performing CO{sub 2 } vertical injection wells. Four additional single laterals from existing vertical production wells were also completed. Phase 2 was completed in April 2001...|$|E

40|$|Using public {{expenditure}} and agricultural production data on Ghana from 1970 to 2012, this paper assesses the returns to public {{spending in the}} agricultural sector, taking into consideration expenditures on agriculture {{as a whole and}} then separately <b>for</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the cocoa versus the noncocoa subsectors. Production functions for the agricultural sector as a whole are estimated first, and then separately for the two subsectors, to obtain elasticities of land productivity with respect to total and sectorial agricultural expenditure. Different regression methods and related diagnostic tests are used to address potential endogeneity of agricultural expenditure, cross-subsector dependence of the production function error terms, and within-subsector serial correlation of the error terms. The estimated elasticities are then used to calculate the rate of return (ROR) to expenditures in the sector as a whole and within the two subsectors. The elasticities are estimated at 0. 43 for total agricultural expenditure; 0. 13 <b>for</b> aggregate <b>expenditure</b> in the noncocoa subsector; and 0. 19 – 0. 53 <b>for</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the cocoa sector, depending on aggregation or disaggregation of expenditure on the Ghana Cocoa Board and other industry costs. The ROR is estimated at 141 – 190 percent <b>for</b> total agricultural <b>expenditure,</b> 124 percent <b>for</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the noncocoa subsector, and 11 – 39 percent <b>for</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the cocoa subsector. The relatively higher ROR in the noncocoa subsector is mostly due to a much lower expenditure-to-productivity ratio. Implications are discussed for raising overall productivity of expenditure in the sector, as well as for further studies, such as obtaining actual time-series data on some of the production factors in the two subsectors and obtaining information on the quality of sectorial expenditures to model different time-lag effects of spending in the different subsectors.
