He stated {{it would be the}} original I.N.R.I. line-up, but that this would be the only tour they would be doing <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> new material. A couple of days later, Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Barlow, {{one of the}} South African {{members of}} the Rest of the World team, {{suggested}} to Sobers {{towards the end of}} the English series that the West Indian might like to take part in a friendly double-wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue and {{the huge}} cost of the indecisive battles {{eventually}} led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to Morkinskinna) the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement. By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had peopled maimed and killed {{as a warning to}} those who disobeyed him. Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird, a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a pit road, the race was split into three {{segments}} of 60, 50 and 40 laps so teams can make pit stops and adjustments between each segment, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> positions gained nor lost during stops. In segment 1, Timothy Peters took the lead from pole-sitter Ken Schrader on lap 15, and led for 23 laps until Kyle Larson took the lead on lap 39, who led {{for the remainder of the}} segment. In the final five laps of the segment, the first caution of the race flew for debris, and the beneficiary was Max Gresham, who was the first driver at least a lap down, which allowed him to regain a lap. In the second segment, Larson continued to lead for a total of 50 laps until Austin Dillon passed him on lap 89 after the former collided with Germán Quiroga. One lap later, another caution was flown for debris, and Gresham was again the beneficiary. On lap 116, Jared Landers' truck became loose in turn 2, collected Ty Dillon and made contact with Johnny Sauter. Quiroga was the beneficiary on the resulting caution. Larson and Austin Dillon dueled for the remainder of the race, with Dillon allowing Larson to pass on lap 122, but Dillon managed to get past Larson on the following lap. Two more cautions for debris (first on the front stretch, the second in turn 4) were eventually flown, and a green–white–checker finish was initiated due to debris in turn 4 on lap 149. Dillon retained the lead on the GWC to win, beating Larson by 1.197 seconds. Behind Dillon and Larson, Ryan Newman finished third, followed by Joey Coulter, Brendan Gaughan, Timothy Peters, Darrell Wallace Jr., Matt Crafton, Dave Blaney and Max Gresham. Sauter (accident) and Jeff Babcock (engine) failed to finish the race.|$|E

25|$|Uncertainty in {{economics}} is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as risk or not.

Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents' responses to it.|$|E
25|$|There was no marked {{increase}} in German {{production in the}} autumn, 1940, in preparation for this major campaign. On 15 October, General Tschersich, the Luftwaffe’s chief of procurement, was basing aircraft replacement on the assumption peace with Britain would be secured, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further military operations until 1 April 1947. Either the procurement officers of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Air Force High Command or OKL) were unaware of Hitler’s intentions, or they did not take him seriously.|$|E
25|$|In May 1974, an {{airworthiness}} certificate for the Corvette was awarded by French authorities. However, deliveries were delayed until early 1974, partially {{as a result}} of industrial action at engine manufacturer United Aircraft of Canada. In response to the lack of deliveries, Air Center Inc. sued Aérospatiale for non-performance, having only received a single non-certified demonstrator aircraft out of a contracted fleet of 70 production Corvettes which had been due to be delivered by May 1974. Ultimately, only six new Corvettes would be dispatched to Oklahoma, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> sales of the type during or after 1975; in March 1976, the U.S. marketing programme was terminated by Aérospatiale.|$|E

The Prime Minister later criticised journalists for carrying out demonstrations and at other times praised them for raising awareness. In a widely repeated quote in connection with the case, she said the government could not protect everyone by posting a guard outside their bedrooms. She also told party members that more journalists were killed when her political opponents were in power.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no trace}} of reason in God because reason is desire and God lacks nothing. Adam was not created in reason. Had it been otherwise, his problem could have been healed by natural {{learning}} <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> need of Christ and no need of faith. The worldly case against reason is that its products do not last: a great remedy for some human problem is devised but soon lost patience with and a new novelty is again demanded. Thus thy wisdom is thy woe. Reason should not be discarded but placed as subservient to faith. Reason, like fire and water, is a bad master but a good servant. Above all, one cannot use reason {{to seek out the}} Lord.|$|E
25|$|On 30 March, {{hoping to}} start a popular {{uprising}} against the Austrians, Murat gave the Rimini Proclamation calling all Italian nationalists to war. Although there were many Italians sympathetic to his cause, fearful of the increasing Austrian influence in Italy and longing for independence, most Italians saw Murat as someone trying to save his own crown rather than a figurehead for unification. The Austrians also quickly crushed any unrest <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> general insurrection so long as Austrian troops were stationed in Italy. Despite this, by early April, Murat has reached the Austrian border on the Po River. Across the border in Lombardy, there were reportedly around 40,000 Italian partisans, mostly veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, waiting to join Murat's army as soon he arrived in Milan.|$|E

25|$|In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford. They {{decided the}} new-model college {{would focus on}} the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{religious}} test for admission. Johnson went on to found King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as Provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a Bachelor of Arts and one as Master of Arts. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania. The College was to become influential in guiding : in the Continental Congress, for example, over {{one third of the}} college-affiliated men who contributed the Declaration of Independence between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the College.|$|E
25|$|In March 1968, {{the effort}} to control the private market price of gold was abandoned. A two-tier system began. In this system all central-bank {{transactions}} in gold were insulated from the free market price. Central banks would trade gold among themselves at $35 per troy ounce (112.53 ¢/g) but would not trade with the private market. The private market could trade at the equilibrium market price <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> official intervention. The price immediately jumped to $43 per troy ounce (138.25 ¢/g). The price of gold touched briefly back at $35 (112.53 ¢/g) {{near the end of}} 1969 before beginning a steady price increase. This gold price increase turned steep through 1972 and hit a high that year of over $70 (2.25 $/g). By that time floating exchange rates had also begun to emerge, which indicated the de facto dissolution of the Bretton Woods system. The two-tier system was abandoned in November 1973. By then the price of gold had reached $100 per troy ounce (3.22 $/g).|$|E
25|$|Starting in August 1896, Rhodes {{personally}} {{played a}} key role in ending the Matabele insurgency. With one of the widows of Mzilikazi (Lobengula's father) acting as a go-between, the Company and the rebel izinDuna arranged an indaba for 21 August: the izinDuna agreed to meet Rhodes and three companions in the Matopos Hills. At this meeting, the insurgents vehemently protested against their prior treatment under Company rule, prompting Rhodes to walk away from the other whites and to sit among the Matabele instead, apparently intending to symbolically demonstrate empathy and a spirit of reconciliation. He told the Matabele that he was on their side, and that he would personally ensure the non-recurrence of any abuses. The izinDuna would be fully restored to the status they had held under Lobengula, he said, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> retribution against those who had taken part in the Chimurenga. After four hours, it was agreed to continue the talks. Bitterness endured among some of the rebels, but three further indabas progressed well, and the Matabele rising ended amicably in October 1896.|$|E

25|$|Each {{college has}} {{residential}} rooms, lecture theatres, study rooms, computer rooms and social areas. The {{intention of the}} colleges was {{that they should not}} be just Halls of residence, but complete academic communities. Each college (except Woolf) has its own bar, all rebuilt on a larger scale, and originally its own dining hall (only Rutherford still has a functioning dining hall; Darwin's is hired out for conferences and events; Keynes's was closed in 2000 and converted into academic space, but in 2011 Dolche Vita was expanded and became the dining hall for Keynes students in catered accommodation after Keynes's expansion in 2011; and Eliot's was closed in 2006). It was expected that each college (more were planned) would have around 600 students as members, with an equivalent proportion of staff, with half the students living within the college itself and the rest coming onto campus to eat and study within their colleges. Many facilities, ranging from accommodation, tutorials and alumni relations, would be handled on a college basis. With no planned academic divisions below the Faculty level, the colleges would be main focus of students' lives <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> units of a similar or smaller size to provide a rival focus of loyalties.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{the police}} station, {{both sides were}} still firing on each other. A few wounded Israelis who were unable to take cover in the nearby {{buildings}} lay stranded on the streets. The Egyptians concentrated their fire against the paratroopers in the building. The Israelis decided to release a police officer to inform the Egyptians of their desire to surrender, provided the Egyptians guaranteed {{they would not be}} harmed. The police officer left the building and told Sarhan that the Israelis wanted to surrender. Sarhan took the officer to Colonel Fathy 'Abbas, head of intelligence in the southern sector of the canal. 'Abbas met both men before noon that day, and was enthusiastic to accept the Israeli surrender and end the fighting, especially considering the potential intelligence gains. 'Abbas asked both men {{to go back to the}} police station and negotiate terms of surrender with the Israelis. They were unable to enter the building however, as the shooting would not stop and there was no overall commander in control of the militia surrounding the police station. The police officer, an old man, lost his nerve and would not come near the building. Consequently, no negotiations took place <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> Israeli surrender.|$|E
500|$|On the Foundation's motion, Judge Alison J. Nathan severed and {{dismissed}} from the lawsuit the partnership's copyright claim. According to Judge Nathan, the Constitution allows federal courts to decide only [...] "Cases" [...] or [...] "Controversies", which means ongoing or imminent disputes over legal rights, involving concrete facts and specific acts, that require court intervention {{in order to}} shield the plaintiff from harm or interference with its rights. The judge held that the partnership's complaint fell short of that standard because even if the Foundation continued to claim ownership of the design's copyright—and even if its claim was invalid—that claim would not legally harm the partnership or prevent it from making its own lawful uses of the design. The partnership did not claim that it owned the design's copyright, only that the Foundation did not. Since, according to the court, the Foundation promised not to sue the partnership for any [...] "potentially copyright-infringing uses of the Banana Design", the partnership could continue using the design <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> legal action that the Foundation could take (under copyright law) to stop it. And if, the court concluded, the partnership could continue with business as usual (as far as copyright was concerned) {{regardless of whether the}} Foundation actually owned the design's copyright, a court decision would have no practical consequences for the partnership; it would be a purely academic (or [...] "advisory") opinion, which federal courts may not issue. The court therefore [...] "dismissed without prejudice" [...] the partnership's request that it resolve whether the Foundation owned the design's copyright.|$|E
