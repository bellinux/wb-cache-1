25|$|Uranus is {{the third}} largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a {{distance}} of about 2.8billion kilometers (1.7billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the plane of the ecliptic. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought {{to be the result of}} a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> what to expect when observing Uranus.|$|E
500|$|Middle-class blacks {{throughout}} the United States [...] "were not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> {{how to behave}} or how whites would behave toward them", as Bart Landry puts it. In Cincinnati, the African-American newspaper editor Wendell Dabney wrote {{of the situation in}} the 1920s that [...] "hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected." [...] Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: not one hotel or other accommodation was open to blacks in Salt Lake City, in the 1920s. Black travelers were stranded if they had to stop there overnight. Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined U.S. Route 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, admitted black customers. Across the whole state of New Hampshire, only three motels in 1956 served African Americans.|$|E
500|$|The {{critic for}} The Spectator felt that [...] "Ian Fleming {{has taken a}} hint from films of his books and is now {{inclined}} to send himself up. I am not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that he is wise", while The Belfast Telegraph considered that Fleming was [...] "still {{in a class of}} his own." [...] The Bookman declared that You Only Live Twice [...] "must rank among the best of the Bonds". Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in Esquire magazine disagreed, writing that [...] "You Only Live Twice has a decidedly perfunctory air. Bond can only manage to sleep with his Japanese girl with the aid of colour pornography. His drinking sessions seem somehow desperate, and the horrors are too absurd to horrify... it's all rather a muddle and scarcely in the tradition of Secret Service fiction. Perhaps the earlier novels are better. If so, I shall never know, having no intention of reading them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{says that}} prayer may relieve {{a person of}} the need to take active {{measures}} to address issues around them, [...] stating: Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I'm not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> about that. For one thing, if they really wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket of {{the period}} did feature {{numerous}} great names such as Grace, Trumper, Blythe, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Frank Woolley, but {{that in itself is}} not unique as any period in cricket history can boast its great players. As David Frith pointed out, the nostalgia [...] "needed someone to put a perspective on it". In his 1939 autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "I have a notion that the cricket of the nineties and early nineteen hundreds was more amusing to watch, but I am not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that the game of today is not more difficult to play".|$|E
2500|$|Sakharov {{never felt}} that by {{creating}} nuclear weapons he had [...] "known sin", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote: [...] "After more than forty years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror... may have helped to prevent one. But I am not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race... Each of us {{has a responsibility to}} think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his retirement, Stanfield {{stayed out}} of {{politics}} until the constitutional debates, when he endorsed and campaigned for the Meech Lake Accord, the Charlottetown Accord, and free trade. He said that the Meech Lake Accord was {{a second chance to}} save Canada from disaster. [...] "I'm not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that I would {{want to live in a}} country that rejected Meech Lake," [...] he said at the time. [...] "It wouldn't be the Canada I grew up in. It wouldn't be the country with the values that I've loved during my life." [...] Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wanted to appoint Stanfield as U.N. ambassador saying, [...] "I tried to engage him further but he was leading a vigorous life and a very active life and he didn't want to change after a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling you what to do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E

60|$|Bradley did {{not feel}} <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> of his success. He had been {{something}} alien to himself in that speech, {{and he could not}} remember what he had said or done. He was not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that he had done the right thing or the best thing. He was suspicious of his power because he no longer felt it. He was like a man who had dreamed of flying and woke to find himself paralyzed. After his triumph he was the same great, awkward, country hired-man.|$|E

[...] "But {{it is too late}} now, I suppose, to talk of that. It seems to me that Jack never even thinks of looking at Eva." ...|$|R
