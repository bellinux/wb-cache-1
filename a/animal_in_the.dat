5|$|Being a key <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep {{are most often}} associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the status}} of Lipizzans as the only breed of horse {{developed}} in Slovenia, via the Lipica stud that is now located within its borders, Lipizzans are recognized in Slovenia as a national animal. For example, a pair of Lipizzans is featured on the 20-cent Slovenian euro coins. Mounted regiments of Carabinieri police in Italy also employ the Lipizzan as one of their mounts. In October 2008, during a visit to Slovenia, a Lipizzan at Lipica, named 085 Favory Canissa XXII, was given to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. She decided to leave the <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> care of the stud farm.|$|E
5|$|Orcinus orca is {{the only}} {{recognized}} extant species in the genus Orcinus, one of many animal species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in Systema Naturae. Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his Piscium & aquatilium animantium natura of 1558, {{part of the larger}} Historia animalium, based on examination of a dead stranded <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.|$|E
30|$|However, we {{did find}} a {{negative}} correlation between the percentage of reported chronically sick <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> herd and fertility rates (Pearson's r = 0.4506, p = 0.0404, n = 21), but not between the percentage of reported chronically sick <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> herd and brucellosis prevalence, suggesting that keeping chronically sick <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> herd lowered overall fertility, but that is likely not due to brucellosis.|$|R

5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and diversely {{than any other}} animal. In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative. However, it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning. One of the popular forms of the lion is explicitly heraldic form, including in the Persian coat of arms (the lion and sun); the <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms of the Mamluk Baybars and perhaps also in that of the Rum Saldjukids {{of the name of}} Kilidi Arslan; and in numismatic representations.|$|E
5|$|These {{patterns}} – a few common {{species and}} many rare ones; {{the dominance of}} arthropods and sponges; and the percentage frequencies of different life-styles – seem to apply {{to all of the}} Burgess Shale. However the identity of the dominant species differs between sites. For example, Marrella splendens is often credited as the commonest <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Burgess Shale, because of its abundance among the specimens collected by Walcott, but is only the third-most abundant organism in the Greater Phyllopod Bed, and very rare at other localities.|$|E

5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion {{that makes a}} loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The player {{directly}} {{controls the}} character Lightning through a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the character, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of Lightning Returns, as with Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel XIII-2, is rendered to scale with the character, who navigates the world on foot. In one of the areas, the player can use chocobos, a recurring <b>animal</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Final Fantasy series. The player is able to freely navigate the game's open world layout, explore towns and country areas, and accept quests from various non-playable characters (NPCs). Lightning is also able to sprint for limited periods, climb up ladders and jump freely. The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard, the latter of which is unlocked after first completing the game. There is also a New Game+ option, whereby players can start a new game while carrying over their equipment and stats from a previous playthrough. The in-game clock runs continuously during normal navigation, with one in-game day equating to {{two to three hours}} in real time on Easy mode and one hour on Normal and Hard modes. The timer starts out at seven in-game days, but can be extended to a maximum of thirteen days. The timer stops during cutscenes, conversations and battles. Lightning can also pause time using an ability called Chronostasis.|$|E
