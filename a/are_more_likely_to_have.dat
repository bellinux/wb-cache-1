5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), {{and changes in the}} color of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|Forests cover 65% of the state, {{primarily}} with deciduous, broad leaf {{trees in the}} western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of Virginia. Lower altitudes <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However, since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests. In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found. The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in eastern and central Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 is a sunlike {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Cygnus that has a mass of 0.95 (± 0.1) Msun and a radius of 1.1 (± 0.1) Rsun. In other words, Kepler-11 is approximately 5% less massive and 10% wider than the Sun. The star's metallicity is 0 (± 0.1), meaning {{that the level of}} iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost {{the same as that of}} the Sun. Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher metallicity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> planets detected around them. This may be because the higher metallicity provides more material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has five other known planets in orbit: Kepler-11c, Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, Kepler-11f, and Kepler-11g. The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury, while Kepler-11g orbits further out.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been born in late winter and early spring.

5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Human {{factors are}} the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 UCLA Law Review-All Rights Reserved. Of the large, public {{companies}} {{that seek to}} remain in business through bankruptcy reorganization, only 70 percent succeed.

This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to <b>more</b> experienced judges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed.
