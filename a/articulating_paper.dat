Methods: A series of photographs of 14 tissue borne complete dentures with occlusal markings was obtained. <b>Articulating</b> <b>paper</b> was used intra-orally at the delivery visit to make the occlusal markings. The denture sets were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised pictures of the 14 complete lower dentures on their own, and group 2 comprised pictures of the same 14 lower dentures together with their opposing upper denture. The two groups of images were loaded into a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation as well as Keynote. Two experienced observers analysed the complete dentures independently and noted the number and distribution of the markings that they felt required adjustment. They differed, but discussed these and reached consensus. These data served as the control. Three groups of observers (10 per group) were then asked to analyse the occlusal markings of the 2 groups of denture images twice, with a two-week interval between each assessment. Before each subsequent assessment, the images were randomised by means of computer-generated random number sequence. The mean number of markings was established for each group and compared with the control mean. Intra-rater reliability was established by comparing the difference of the means of sequential observations for each rater by establishing the z-value. Inter-rater reliability within each group was established by means of analysis of variance. Results: Considering all the data, in only 17 instances (of the possible 60), did observers’ mean scores not differ from the control mean scores with good intra-rater reliability. In all other 43 instances the observers’ mean scores differed from the control mean scores and/or displayed poor intra-rater reliability. Considerable variation in inter-rater reliability was also found within every group of observers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reproducibility}} of the mandibular arc {{of closure}} in the articulator {{is critical in}} prosthodontics.

The results showed that the first occlusal contact in mouth is close to those observed in the non-arcon articulator. Two main conclusions of the present study are pointed out: (a) both arcon and non-arcon articulators are useful devices to diminish the need for occlusal adjustments in prosthodontics; (b) the T-Scan III computerized occlusal analysis system is not only a powerful diagnostic tool and an accurate way to dynamically measure occlusion in vivo, but also an appropriate device for experimental occlusal studies...|$|E

For such purpose, a pilot study was performed in which 16 asymptomatic young patients were subjected to a clinical examination, including a careful occlusal analysis and then individual deprogrammer devices (&# 8220;Lucia's JIG&# 8221;) were fabricated. Premature contacts were clinically identified in centric relation (CR) for each patient by jaw manipulation and interocclusal marking with <b>articulating</b> <b>paper</b> (Accufilm). Subsequently, these devices were adjusted in CR and used during the tomographic exams in such a way that CBCT in CR could be obtained. After routine processing, the images were analyzed in order to identify occlusal prematurity on the displayed images by 30 professionals divided according to areas of activity (occlusion specialist, general practitioner and radiologist; n= 10 per area) and time of professional experience (less than 5, between 5 and 10, and over 10 years). By comparing the premature contacts identified in the clinical analysis and CBCT images, an agreement index between these two variables was calculated.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{method for}} {{correcting}} unilateral crossbite in the deciduous dentition was tested in 25 young children. A composite guiding cusp was constructed on the buccal {{side of the}} upper canine or first or second primary molar on the crossbite side. This prevented the patient from biting into crossbite. Premature contacts between canines and primary molars were roughly ground without <b>articulating</b> <b>paper.</b> A new biting habit in which the midlines of the dental arches coincided was taught to the patient {{with the aid of}} a mirror. Reactions were studied by clinical examinations and by comparing models at the start of the treatment and six months later. The width of the dental arch was measured at the canines and first and second primary molars. The patients had learned the new biting habit after a month, and the upper dental arch was widened spontaneously by about 1. 4 millimetres after six months. All crossbites were successfully treated and the first permanent molars erupted in the correct transverse relationship. The method seems suitable for the correction of unilateral crossbite in the deciduous dentition provided that the cause of the crossbite (dummy-sucking, thumb-sucking) is no longer present at the start of the treatment. Furthermore the method is obviously not efficient in cases of genuine mandibular prognathism...|$|E

Introduction: The {{performance}} of registration {{materials and methods}} has been researched by many investigators {{in an effort to}} thoroughly understand the patient’s occlusion. 1 - 23 In the dental community, <b>articulating</b> <b>paper</b> has been widely accepted as the gold standard for occlusal analysis. 24 However, published studies about its physical properties (thickness, composition, ink substrate, plastic deformation) offer no evidence to suggest that variable <b>articulating</b> <b>paper</b> mark size can be descriptive of variable occlusal loads. 1, 3 - 5, 25 - 31 In 1987, Maness et al 32 first reported the development of the prototype of a new computerized occlusal analysis device (T-Scan® Tekscan Incorporation, Boston, USA). From then to the present, the manufacturer states having improved the system’s accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility. Still, the latest generation (T-Scan®III HD) lacks of independent overall studies on its improved performance, which shall be tested in this paper. A better diagnostic interpretation of the results from the T-Scan®III HD system should be expected. Materials & Methods: The present study aims to test, under different simulated anatomic circumstances, the performances of a computerized occlusal analysis device (T-Scan®III HD Tekscan Incorporation, Boston, USA). For this purpose, four different occlusal tables were created:  two of 120 ° created with an artificial inferior first molar (Ivoclar® Vivadent, Vaduz, Liechtenstein) either embedded in a periodontal ligament simulator or not (representing the anatomy of posterior natural teeth vs an implant);  one of 100 ° (simulating the distortion created to the sensor when anterior teeth occlude);  and finally one plane surface of 180 ° (control) in static and variable positions. Three levels of force (10 N, 50 N and 150 N) were applied 40 times each by a universal testing machine (Autograph®, AG-I; Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). A polished spherical bur (diameter= 2, 2 mm) assured the contact on the sensor film. All T-Scan®III HD recordings were compared through a One-way ANOVA statistical analysis with post-hoc tests using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Results: According to our study, the following results were obtained:  The sensor film could produce repeatable data for a mean of 85. 71 closures {{with a standard deviation of}} 35. 99;  85 % of the outliers are within the 5 first closures, representing the conditioning time required by the initially flat sensor  Graphically and statistically sustained differences (p <. 05) could be found : o in the coefficients of variation between tables (180 ° Variable vs. all other) o in the coefficients of variation between the applied loads (10 N vs. 50 N vs. 150 N); o in the mean RAW-sum between the different tables for the same applied load. Conclusions: An undeniable improvement of this newest T-Scan® system as compared to former designs could be proved. However, when using the T-Scan®III HD system, some points of capital importance have to be considered:  Its sensitivity seems to be improved as compared to former designs, however futher studies on its variability throughout its sensing surface are required;  Its reproducibility could be proved, except for the 5 first values (outliers to the mean values), which shall be used as a conditioning time to both the sensor and the patient;  Its accuracy proved to be dependent of the anatomic circumstances and requires a trained interpretation;  Particular caution has to be taken when interpreting the force % of a rigid vs. non-rigid model, for instance when balancing a mixed occlusion (implant-tooth). Our study shows that despite the technologic advances made in the area of occlusal analysis, a critical interpretation and a careful handling of the depicted values is indispensable, and can only be acquired through a long learning curve...|$|E
40|$|This {{comparative}} study {{was carried out}} to study the pattern of occlusal discrepancies in fifty patients with myofacial pain dyfunction syndrome attending Khartoum Teaching Dental Hospital and in another fifty control subjects who were free from any sign or sympton of the diesease. The examination of occulusion was done both clinically using a plain mirror and an <b>articulating</b> <b>paper</b> and on the laboratery using study models mounted on a (Hanau) type articulator with the bite fork and an ear piece face bow.

The {{results of the study}} showed there was a significent relation between the occurance of Myofacial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome and class II div I with P = 0. 049. Neither class I nor class III malocculsion with P value = 0. 114, P value = 0. 646 respectively, showed significant relationship with the disease. On function it appeared that occlusial interferences on the non - working side has {{a significant role in the}} occurance of TMJD (P value of 0. 001). Contorary to the occlusal interferences on the working side which were found to play no role in the disease (P = 0. 52). Both altered occlusal surface by wear or caries as well as loss of molar teeth was found to have a significant relation to TMJD. Also premature contact in centric relation and the slide of centric relation to cenrtic occlusion were found to play role in TMJD, with p-value = 0. 016 and p-value = 0. 041. Recent dental intervention either with restoration or with prosthesis, show insignificant relations with a P–value= 0. 52 and 0. 67 respectively.
