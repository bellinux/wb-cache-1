5|$|<b>Austen</b> met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying <b>Austen</b> in 1797. <b>Austen</b> family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the <b>Austen</b> family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. <b>Austen</b> received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. <b>Austen</b> at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. <b>Austen</b> biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E
5|$|<b>Austen</b> sent short {{pieces of}} writing to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth. There is {{manuscript}} evidence that <b>Austen</b> {{continued to work}} on these pieces as late as 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward <b>Austen,</b> made further additions as late as 1814.|$|E

5|$|While Murray {{prepared}} Emma for publication, <b>Austen</b> began The Elliots, later {{published as}} Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, {{shortly after the}} publication of Emma, Henry <b>Austen</b> repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. <b>Austen</b> was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank <b>Austen</b> large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.|$|E

5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} <b>Austen</b> often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that <b>Austen</b> was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and <b>Austen</b> must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane <b>Austen</b> never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E

5000|$|Despite these {{positive}} reactions from the elite, <b>Austens</b> novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for Sense and Sensibility, three for Pride and Prejudice, none for Mansfield Park, and seven for Emma. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. [...] They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on <b>Austens</b> reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, [...] "their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, {{for the benefit of}} women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in <b>Austens</b> day.|$|R

5|$|The {{reception}} {{history of}} Jane <b>Austen</b> follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane <b>Austen</b> (1775–1817), {{the author of}} such works as Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Emma (1815), {{has become one of}} the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.|$|E
50|$|Even {{the birth}} of the British Empire is largely absent from her world. However, the owners of Mansfield Park have a {{plantation}} in the Caribbean, and the <b>Austens</b> had a connection with India, since that is where Eliza and her mother, Philadelphia Hancock, had arrived from around 1786. Indeed, the <b>Austens</b> were warm supporters of Warren Hastings, Philadelphia's long time friend (and possibly Eliza's father), when he was sued for serious misdemeanour in India before being cleared in April 1795.|$|R
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} examine {{displays}} of ageism within Jane <b>Austen???s</b> six core novels. Ageism {{is defined as}} prejudice and discrimination against an individual based upon age. First, I studied a specific character who demonstrates ageism, Emma Woodhouse. The possession of wealth blinds her to her obligations towards the elderly Mrs. Bates and singlewoman Miss Bates, while also enabling her father???s hypochondria via benign ageism. Secondly, I examine Jane <b>Austen???s</b> commentary (through her narration) on older men and older women. During these assessments, I found that ageist attitudes come in two varieties in the novels of Jane Austen: characters who are overtly ageist are {{to be seen as}} erring in judgment (no matter how benign the behavior), while <b>Austen???s</b> use of ageist stereotypes serves to promote the independence of her heroines by weakening their figures of authority...|$|R

50|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Jane Fairfax: A New Novel (1940) is {{inspired}} by Jane <b>Austens</b> novel Emma. It is somewhat experimental in that it mixes together characters from Emma, characters devised by Royde-Smith, and the two authors themselves.|$|R
50|$|The next Pemberley Digital {{project was}} Emma Approved, an {{adaptation}} of Jane <b>Austens</b> Emma, which premiered in 2014. Created by Su, who executive produces with Green, the web-series follows Emma Woodhouse as she documents her business success with her lifestyle company.|$|R
5|$|From 1773 until 1796, George <b>Austen</b> {{supplemented}} {{his income}} by farming and by teaching {{three or four}} boys at a time, who boarded at his home.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane <b>Austen,</b> but unlike <b>Austen,</b> who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George <b>Austen</b> {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane <b>Austen</b> was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing <b>Austen</b> wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E

5000|$|Entertainment Weekly {{reviewed}} Pride and Prejudice and Zombies favorably, {{giving it}} a grade of A&minus;. Library Journal recommended the novel [...] "...for all popular fiction collections". The A.V. Club gave the novel a grade of A, commenting that [...] "(w)hat begins as a gimmick ends with renewed appreciation of the indomitable appeal of <b>Austens</b> language, characters, and situations..." [...] The New Yorkers Macy Halford, however, called the books estimated blend of eighty-five percent <b>Austens</b> words and fifteen percent Grahame-Smiths [...] "one hundred per cent terrible"; while she admitted that the mashup may have accurately identified a subtextual theme of [...] "mystery and menace" [...] in the original novel, she still found Grahame-Smiths writing to be awful, singling out a passage in which Elizabeth Bennett prepares to kill Mr. Darcy over an overheard slight.|$|R
