5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Bond as Saint George. The Saint George theme is echoed {{by the fact that it}} is a British agent sorting out an American problem.|$|E

5|$|Le Guin's {{interest}} in Taoism influenced {{much of her}} science fiction work. Douglas Barbour stated that the fiction of the Hainish Universe contains <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> balance between light and darkness, a central theme of Taoism. She was also influenced by her early {{interest in}} mythology, and her exposure to cultural diversity as a child. Her protagonists are frequently interested in the cultures they are investigating, and are motivated to preserve them rather than conquer them. Authors that influenced Le Guin include Victor Hugo, Lev Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Italo Calvino, and Lao Tzu.|$|E

5|$|Michael Weyland's {{ambiguous}} {{humanity is}} a subject of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> the Alien franchise: what matters is a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E
5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's subjects were classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was disappointed with the response of British critics to the exhibition, and their focus on <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> nationhood paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E
5|$|The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) {{is a form}} {{of poetry}} common in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Urdu and Bengali poetry. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain {{at the end of the}} second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an {{identical}} meter. The ghazal often reflects on <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> unattainable love or divinity.|$|E

5|$|The {{plots of}} the unmade serials also vary. <b>A</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> a {{civilisation}} {{where women are}} dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were moved from one serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Chrono Cross {{focuses on a}} teenage boy named Serge and <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> {{parallel}} worlds. Faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to discover {{the truth of the}} two worlds' divergence. The flashy thief Kid and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido. Struggling to uncover his past and find the mysterious Frozen Flame, Serge is chiefly challenged by Lynx, a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E

5|$|Continuing <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> his presidency, in 2006 Mosley {{called for}} Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion}} of the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|During 1937 Britten {{composed}} a Pacifist March to words by Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, {{he had become}} an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. The best known of his compositions from this period is probably Variations on <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> <b>of</b> Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like Rutherford, ran as an independent. Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E

5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes that there is <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, {{towards the end of}} the novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E

5|$|Nostalgia for old Hollywood movies {{would be}} <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Donen's next film: Movie Movie, {{produced}} by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment and scripted by Larry Gelbart and Sheldon Keller. The film is actually two shorter films presented {{as an old}} fashioned double feature, complete with a fake movie trailer and an introduction by comedian George Burns. It starred George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Michael Kidd and Eli Wallach and premiered in competition at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. The first of the two films is Dynamite Hands, {{a black and white}} tribute to boxing – morality films. The second film is Baxter's Beauties of 1933, a tribute to the extravagant musicals of Busby Berkely. Like Donen's previous two films, it was unsuccessful both financially and critically.|$|E
5|$|Other {{creative}} {{artists have}} celebrated Britten. In 1970 Walton composed Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten, {{based on a}} theme from Britten's Piano Concerto. Works commemorating Britten include Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten an orchestral piece written in 1977 by Arvo Pärt, and Sally Beamish's Variations on <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> <b>of</b> Benjamin Britten, based on the second Sea Interlude from Peter Grimes; she composed the work to mark Britten's centenary. Alan Bennett depicts Britten in a 2009 play The Habit of Art, set while Britten is composing Death in Venice and centred on a fictional meeting between Britten and Auden. Britten was played in the premiere production by Alex Jennings.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> unity and reconciliation.|$|E
