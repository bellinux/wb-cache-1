The title of her debut video, Number.1!, released in October 2002 by Moodyz when she was 18, is a play on her name (in Japanese name order, Nanba An sounds close to English [...] "Number One").|$|E

2500|$|It is {{the members}} of the Labia family of the mid 18th century to whom the palazzo owes its notability today, it was {{inhabited}} by two brothers with their wives, children and mother. [...] The brothers Angelo Maria Labia and his brother Paolo Antonio Labia employed Tiepolo {{at the height of his}} powers to decorate the ballroom. [...] Employing Tiepolo seems to have been the most remarkable thing the brothers ever achieved. Angelo Maria became an Abbé, merely in order to escape the political obligations of an aristocrat of the Republic. [...] Curiously his holy employment did not prevent him marrying. His wife however was a commoner, which indicates an almost morganatic status to the marriage. [...] Angelo's chief interests were constructing a marionette theatre, which concealed real singers behind its scenes. [...] The marionettes often performed satirical plays which Angelo wrote himself. [...] In later life he failed to endear himself to Venetian society by becoming an informer to the dreaded inquisition. [...] His younger brother Paolo, married conventionally into the old Venetian aristocracy, a class prepared to accept the Labia's money and hospitality if not equality. [...] Paolo too never assumed any public duties. [...] It appears that it was their mother, Maria Labia, who was the intellectual driving force of the family, in her youth a great beauty, she was painted by Rosalba Carriera. The French traveller and social commentator Charles de Brosses reported that in old <b>age</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a lively wit, flirtatious nature and possessed the finest collection of jewels in Europe. [...] This collection was also portrayed in some of Tiepolo's work in the palazzo.|$|E

Crickets chirped and frogs in the marshes sang their hoarse love songs, but otherwise an intense stillness pervaded the countryside. You must not consider Josie O'Gorman an especially brave girl, for she had no thought of fear in such solitary wanderings.

60|$|She was the celebrated, the perpetual, the {{necessary}} ingénue, who {{with all her}} talent couldn't have represented a woman of her actual <b>age.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> the gliding, hopping movement of a small bird, the same air of {{having nothing to do}} with time, and the clear, sure, piercing note, a miracle of exact vocalisation. She chaffed her companions, she chaffed the room; she might have been a very clever little girl trying to personate a more innocent big one. She scattered her amiability about--showing Miriam how the children of Molière took their ease--and it quickly placed her in the friendliest communication with Peter Sherringham, who already enjoyed her acquaintance and who now extended it to his companions, and in particular to the young lady sur le point d'entrer au théâtre.|$|E
