5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, the fabric of {{the building}} remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> building was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished in the spring of 2008. The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E
25|$|The 18 motor {{boats were}} not {{operational}} until November 1940, when a full trial {{was carried out}} with a reduced warhead against the old World War I scout cruiser Quarto. That was just six months after Italy's entry into World War II as an ally of Nazi Germany. More extensive testing before the official line-up showed once <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boat's operational performance was limited. Therefore, an improved sea-going version was designed, the MTM (Motoscafo da Turismo Modificato), which also included a reverse gear.|$|E
25|$|In {{the often}} {{encountered}} case of I= 1/2 nuclei (e.g., 1H, 19F, 31P), the line intensities {{produced by a}} population of radicals, each possessing M equivalent nuclei, will follow Pascal's triangle. For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three 1H nuclei of the CH3 radical give rise to 2MI+ 1= 2(3)(1/2)+ 1= 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio. The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of aH = 23 G {{for each of the}} three 1H nuclei. Note <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lines in this spectrum are first derivatives of absorptions.|$|E

25|$|Following {{its debut}} as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975. This time, it wore a rakishly slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose {{designed}} for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later {{to show up}} on the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered opera windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available {{for the first half of}} the model year after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package, affirming <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> age of muscle was long gone.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2008, in Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1145 (C.D. Cal. 2008), Judge Larson ruled <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Superboy {{character}} {{was not a}} work for hire. Larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the Siegel heirs' claim to the Superman and Superboy works. The Siegels regained the copyright to the Superman character, story, and indicia as they appeared in Action Comics #1 (but not prior to or after that). Judge Larson later expanded his ruling to allow the Siegel heirs to claim additional plots, Superman characters, costuming, and indicia.|$|E
25|$|Walking {{the streets}} of Venice, Aschenbach is accosted at every turn by beggars, street sellers and others {{demanding}} his custom. Seeing rubbish {{on the streets and}} smelling the foul water of the canals, he feels nauseated and claustrophobic, and decides that he must leave Venice. Back at the hotel, the Manager expresses his regret over Aschenbach's departure. When Tadzio returns Aschenbach's glances, Aschenbach himself also feels regret. On arriving at the station, Aschenbach finds that his luggage has been sent on the wrong train ("I am furious because I am forced to return, but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd"), and he realises upon seeing Tadzio <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy was the cause of his regret at leaving.|$|E

25|$|Another {{element in}} the closure {{decision}} was the condition of Lewes Viaduct. The Ministry of Transport had been advised in 1964 by its Divisional Road Engineer that {{the condition of the}} viaduct would entail high maintenance costs in the near future. In June 1965, the Engineer reported <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bridges and viaduct on the line between Barcombe Mills and Lewes were in need of expensive repairs. A speed limit of 10mph was introduced on the viaduct in September 1967. In March 1968, BRB informed the Ministry that unless the section of line between Lewes and the start of the Hamsey Loop could be eliminated {{by the end of the}} year, either by rebuilding the Hamsey Loop or by closing the line, emergency remedial work would be required.|$|E
25|$|The Chickasaw {{tried to}} remain neutral, but when groups of Natchez began seeking refuge in 1730, the Chickasaw {{allied with the}} {{refugees}} against the French. By 1731 the Chickasaw had accepted many refugees. When in 1731 the French demanded the surrender of Natchez living among them, the Chickasaw refused. French-Chickasaw relations rapidly deteriorated, resulting in the Chickasaw Wars. Some of the Natchez warriors who had found refuge among the Chickasaw joined them in fighting the French. The Natchez Wars and the Chickasaw Wars were also related to French attempts to gain free passage along the Mississippi River. During the 1736 campaign against the Chickasaw, the French demanded <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Natchez among them be turned over. The Chickasaw, compromising, turned over several Natchez, along with some French prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} more formal selection process {{seems to have}} been followed than for the 1900 tour but the team was still selected by representatives from Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad. The team was perhaps a little stronger than that of 1900 but two tours to the West Indies in 1901-02 and 1904-05 had shown <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> combined West Indies team was of quite a modest standard compared to English first-class counties. Despite this the same mistake was made as in 1900 and an overly ambitious tour programme was arranged. This included 19 matches, mostly against first-class counties. As in 1900 they suffered a series of heavy defeats early on but later in the tour had some success, particularly in heavily defeating Yorkshire. The first-class teams fielded somewhat weakened sides to make the matches more competitive but the early defeats had again limited public interest.|$|E

25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

500|$|... "Amy's Choice" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was {{positive about the}} episode, calling it [...] "probably the strongest all-round script we've had this year, chock full of good lines". He added, [...] "The concept of aliens inhabiting elderly people and turning them psychotic was wittily realised, particularly the bizarre sight of them laying siege to Amy and Rory's cottage with household and gardening implements". He concluded that it [...] "was one of those stories that you would only find in Doctor Who, and shows once <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series can provide genuine thought-provoking, interesting drama alongside its thrills and spills".|$|E
500|$|According to Michael Moorcock, [...] "He also, {{when faced}} with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously {{proposed}} and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed.

500|$|In 1978, Mark Melton Moore, {{the brother}} of real-life victim Polly Ann Moore, took Pierce to court for $1.3 million for invading his privacy.

[...] In real life, Polly Ann Moore graduated high school at the age of 16. The court denied his claim in 1979. Mr. Moore filed again in 1980 to the Texas Supreme Court.

500|$|On June 9, 2008, New Scientist {{published}} an article describing Richard Lenski's 20-year E. coli experiment, which reported that the bacteria evolved the ability to metabolize citrate. Schlafly contacted Lenski to request the data. Lenski explained that the relevant data was in the paper and that Schlafly fundamentally misunderstood it. Schlafly wrote again and requested the raw data. Lenski replied <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relevant data {{was already in the}} paper, that the [...] "raw data" [...] were living bacterial samples, which he would willingly share with qualified researchers at properly equipped biology labs, and that he felt insulted by letters and comments on Conservapedia which he saw as brusque and offensive, including claims of outright deceit. The Daily Telegraph later called Lenski's reply [...] "one of the greatest and most comprehensive put-downs in scientific argument".|$|E
500|$|In 1648 a {{group of}} merchants in London applied to Parliament for {{revocation}} of the Maryland charter from the Calverts. This was rejected, but Claiborne received a final opportunity to reclaim Kent Island when he was appointed by the Puritan-controlled Parliament to a commission which was charged with suppressing Anglican disquiet in Virginia; Virginia in this case defined as [...] "all the plantations in the Bay of the Chesapeake." [...] Claiborne and fellow commissioner Richard Bennett secured the peaceful submission of Virginia to Parliamentary rule, and the new Virginia Assembly appointed Claiborne as Secretary of the colony. It also proposed to Parliament new acts which would give Virginia more autonomy from England, which would benefit Claiborne as he pressed his claims on Kent Island. He and Bennett then {{turned their attention to}} Maryland and, arguing <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Calverts could not be trusted and that the charter gave the Calverts too much power, demanded that the colony submit to the Commonwealth. Governor Stone briefly refused but gave in to Claiborne and the Commission, and submitted Maryland to Parliamentary rule.|$|E

[...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they make, so we'll just remind you they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from Channel Guide said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga may be trying too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers seemed a bit rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E
