500|$|In America, {{especially}} in Chicago and New York, {{and numerous other}} global cities, high rise skyscrapers of phallic shape {{grew up in the}} 20th century. Le Corbusier, the famous architect, propagated it in Europe in place of traditional decorative architecture. Similar futuristic developments took place in Italy with the initiative of Sant’Elia, symbolizing the triumph of man. Yet unlike those of ancient times which were blatant architectural representations of the phallus, in the West in modern times [...] "shrines to the phallus" [...] are more subtle, and may often be subject to interpretation as such; very few architects have specifically admitted the human phallus as a source for their <b>architectural</b> <b>creation.</b> The Italian Fascists were cited as having an obsession with phallic architecture which was rigid and impermeable. In the last few decades the high-rise phallic skyscraper has been a symbol of government quest for economic power in China, Hong Kong and South Korea and the other ASEAN/Pacific Rim nations. China fuels billions of dollars annually into high-rise office and residential buildings with the aim of increasing GDP, at a rate far greater than they can be occupied.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-1920s, as {{the demand}} for border designs weakened, Teague had become lightly {{involved}} in commercial packaging. Intrigued by the International Paris Exposition and European stylistic movements, Teague left for Europe on June 30, 1926 to investigate European design. While abroad he familiarized himself with Bauhaus work during an exhibition in Italy, and became greatly inspired by the <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> and writings of Le Corbusier.|$|R

5000|$|The 1920s in Seattle saw {{a change}} in the style of popular architecture. Inspired by the newness of the country, Seattle architects had {{expressed}} freedom in their <b>architectural</b> <b>creations.</b> [...] By this time people’s interest in the Arts and Crafts Movement, seen in the popular residential bungalow designs in the early 20th century, was beginning to decline. Design now turned to an eclectic-historic combination, particularly of the Classical Revival and English Revival styles. The Blackstone particularly reflects this turn, combining Classical design elements with modern technology.|$|R

5000|$|Stupas, {{also called}} dagobas and cetiyas, are {{considered}} an outstanding type of <b>architectural</b> <b>creation</b> of ancient Sri Lanka.

The Stupa is also known by synonymous names such as Chaithya, Dagaba, Thupa, Seya and Vehera. Stupas designed and constructed in Sri Lanka are the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world.|$|E
50|$|A multi-tiered archway {{serves as}} the {{entrance}} into the complex. It is miniature {{compared to that of}} Pha That Luang. The functionality of this seemingly simple archway {{is similar to that of}} the torana, or gateway, of Indian culture. The torana served as the passageway from secular ground to sacred ground. The difference is that this archway does not have any images for which a person can meditate and it doesn’t involve circumambulating a stupa. This characteristic may be present in all the temples and stupas that in Laos, especially at King Setthathirat’s more famous <b>architectural</b> <b>creation,</b> Pha That Luang.|$|E
30|$|The {{field of}} {{architectural}} composition indicates that creativity is an original {{starting point for}} a process of transformation that follows a quasi-musical sequence. It is a peculiar attitude addressed at transforming the reality in an unconventional way, which is represented as a memory. This attitude is largely dependent on environments, architects, lifestyles. As a matter of facts, spatial creativity is a terrain on which {{it is hard to}} fix an objective, a referential framework for the interpretation of artistic and/or <b>architectural</b> <b>creations.</b> It drives to an intertwining of own memories, reminiscences with the resemblances of different artists and/or architects.|$|R
50|$|After the Knights Templar's eviction, the Célestins {{installed}} a monastery which, despite some fires, remained for almost 400 years. Eventually demolished in 1778, it {{was replaced with}} the housing estate of the Célestins and a theater. In {{the second half of}} the 19th century, the plan of major <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> through Presqu'île provided for a track linking the rue Mercière and the Place Bellecour to the Place des Célestins. This project was finally cancelled. The square was redeveloped in 1994-1995 when an underground parking lot was dug. On the square, a kind of refracting telescope provides a kaleidoscope view of the car park.|$|R
50|$|Later Goodhue's <b>{{architectural}}</b> <b>creations</b> became freed {{of architectural}} detail and more Romanesque in form, although he remained {{dedicated to the}} integration of sculpture, mosaic work, and color in his surface architectural details. Towards {{the end of his}} career, he arrived at a highly personal style, a synthesis of simplified form and a generalized archaic quality, and those innovations paved the way for others to transition to modern architectural idioms. This style is seen in his last major projects: the 1926 Mediterranean revival and Egyptian revival Los Angeles Public Library; the Nebraska State Capitol; and in his 1922 entry for the Chicago Tribune Tower competition.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} theme {{brought out}} in her <b>architectural</b> <b>creation</b> is titled [...] "Liberty" [...] which presents a reading place as a free book free library where individuals can [...] "sit and read whatever they wish to". This creation is built with three types of trees fixed in the centre of a square space. The trees' [...] "trunks and branches" [...] are made from steel and the leaves made of salvaged books, with the floor made of concrete. Sitting {{under the shade of}} this tree people could indulge in conversation or read a book with the gentle wind blowing through the leaves. This was exhibited at the Placa de Salvador Segui in Barcelona during June-September 2014.|$|E

50|$|In his <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> Bethune {{adopted the}} formal {{vocabulary}} {{of the typical}} late medieval brick architecture of Flanders, and specifically Bruges. Through his influence and teaching he introduced this stance by many of his followers.This, together with his strong Catholic inspiration and his association with the Gothic Revival movement in England, marks the difference between his school and the Neo-Gothic architecture advocated in Belgium by the Academies and the followers of Viollet-le-Duc. The latter school {{was more interested in}} restorations, while their new creations were mostly inspired by the French and Brabantic Gothic architecture. In general their creations were more inspired by a civil romanticism and lacked the religious and social idealism of Bethune and his Saint-Luke schools.|$|R
5000|$|The Architectural Review criticised {{the cynical}} means {{employed}} by British Railways in achieving {{the demolition of}} the arch: [...] Its destruction is wanton and unnecessary - connived at by the British Transport Commission, its guardians, and by the London County Council and the Government, who are jointly responsible for safeguarding London's major architectural monuments, of which this is undoubtedly one. In spite of ... {{being one of the}} outstanding <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> of the early nineteenth century and the most important - and visually satisfying - monument to the railway age which Britain pioneered, the united efforts of many organisations and individuals failed to save it in the face of official apathy and philistinism.|$|R
50|$|For Art Nouveau {{architecture}} and furniture design, {{the most important}} center in Britain was Glasgow, with the creations of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow School, whose work {{was inspired by the}} French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the Glasgow School of Art (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the Glasgow Rose".|$|R
5000|$|The Church {{was damaged}} during Hurricane Dean in 2007, which ripped the roof off the building, and {{required}} $25m ($300,000 USD) in repairs. [...] The Church {{was closed for}} 20 months and underwent significant restoration, reopening in June, 2009. [...] At the official reopening ceremonies of the Church, Prime Minister Bruce Golding's representative (Olivia Grange, then culture minister) said that [...] "Phillippo Baptist Church represents {{a great part of}} the nation's history, therefore, we need for all {{to be aware of the}} pride and joy it gives to see the restoration done. James Phillipo was even denied permission to preach to slaves several times, but this did not stop him from setting up the church". [...] Golding's representative also noted that the church played a major role in the fight for the abolition of slavery, and that even by today's standards is still an impressive <b>architectural</b> <b>creation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Western Chalukya dynasty is {{sometimes}} called the Kalyani Chalukyas, after its regal capital at Kalyani (today's Basavakalyan in Karnataka) or the Later Chalukya from its theoretical relationship to the sixth-century Badami Chalukyas. The Western Chalukyas (ಪಶ್ಚಿಮ ಚಾಲುಕ್ಯ ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ) developed an architectural style (also called Gadag style) known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the early Chalukya Dynasty and the later Hoysala empire. The Chalukyas built {{some of the earliest}} Hindu temples in India. The best-known examples are the Mahadeva Temple (Itagi) in the Koppal District; the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi in the Gadag District and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, both in the Davangere District. Monuments notable for craftsmanship are the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri in the Haveri District, the Amrutesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad District, the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag, and the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal (both in the Gadag district). Aihole was an experimental base for <b>architectural</b> <b>creation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During that period, several {{instance}} of artistic influence are known, particular {{in the area}} of monumental stone sculpture and statuary, an area with no known precedents in India. The main period of stone <b>architectural</b> <b>creation</b> seems to correspond to the period of Ashoka's reign (c.?268 to 232 BCE). Before that, Indians may have had a tradition of wooden architecture, but no remains have ever been found to prove that point. However remains of wooden palisades were discovered at archaeological sites in Pataliputra, confirmed Classical accounts that the city had such wooden ramparts. The first examples of stone architecture were also found in the palace compound of Pataliputra, with the distinctly Hellenistic Pataliputra capital and a pillared hall using polished-stone columns. The other remarkable example of monumental stone architecture is that of the Pillars of Ashoka, themselves displaying no little Hellenistic influence. Overall, according to Boardman, [...] "the visual experience of many Ashokan and later city dwellers in India was considerably conditioned by foreign arts, translated to an Indian environment, just as the archaic Greek had been by the Syrian, the Roman by the Greek, and the Persian by the art of their whole empire".|$|E
25|$|Wright {{relocated}} {{his practice}} {{to his home}} in 1898 in order to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children — Catherine in 1894, David in 1895, and Frances in 1898 — prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive studio addition {{to the north of the}} main house. The space, which included a hanging balcony within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio was a poster for Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which the next ten years of <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> would emerge.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to many similar buildings, {{the palace}} fared well during almost 50 years under Communist {{jurisdiction}} in East Germany. The Church of St. Saviour in Sacrow and {{the centre of}} Potsdam were neglected, {{and some of the}} historic centre of Potsdam was demolished. The Berliner Stadtschloss (Berlin City Palace), containing architectural work by Schinkel, Erdmannsdorff and Knobelsdorff was demolished in 1950, but Sanssouci survived unscathed and the East German government endeavoured to have Sanssouci placed on the list of World Heritage Sites. This was achieved in 1990 with the following citation:The palace and park of Sanssouci, often described as the [...] "Prussian Versailles", are a synthesis of the artistic movements of the 18th century in the cities and courts of Europe. That ensemble is a unique example of the <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> and landscape design {{against the backdrop of the}} intellectual background of monarchic ideas of the state.|$|R
50|$|For a time, Berlenbach Jr. {{worked for}} the {{architectural}} designing firm of James Renwick Jr in 1880. He opened his own company in 1885, an office in 260 Graham Avenue. In partnership with father, Franz Joseph Berlenbach Sr., both engaged primarily {{in the building of}} tenements and small residential houses in Williamsburg, New York. Berlenbach Jr. became involved in designing Roman Catholic churches, specializing in the Romanesque style although also created designs influenced by Italian Renaissance later on. His <b>architectural</b> <b>creations</b> included St. Finbar Church, the Assumption Church, St. Joseph Church, the Blessed Sacrament Church, the St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Church, the St. Matthias Roman Catholic Parish, and the Parish Hall ("Institute") of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Astoria NY (1909). For the Dominican congregation, Berlenbach Jr. accepted jobs from Convent of the Order of St. Dominic in 1889, the Annunciation School in 1892, the Convent of the Church of the Annunciation in 1889, and the St. Sebastian Roman Catholic Church during the mid-1890s.|$|R
