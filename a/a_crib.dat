5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he slept in <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E
25|$|After a {{long day}} searching from house to house, the ATS checked <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> with a broken window on the {{north-eastern}} side of the township. The crib had large hedges on both sides, and a fibrolite shed at the rear. The group spotted Gray briefly at a window, and a battle ensued. Police put a stun grenade through a window, but it bounced off a mattress that Gray had placed as a barricade and landed back near police. Police fired teargas into the crib. Gray began shooting not at police but through the fibrolite shed.|$|E

25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom {{in the back of}} the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E
25|$|A bombe run {{involved}} a cryptanalyst first obtaining <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> — {{a section of}} plaintext that was thought to correspond to the ciphertext. Finding cribs {{was not at all}} straightforward; it required considerable familiarity with German military jargon and the communication habits of the operators. However, the codebreakers were aided {{by the fact that the}} Enigma would never encrypt a letter to itself. This helped in testing a possible crib against the ciphertext, as it could rule out a number of cribs and positions, where the same letter occurred in the same position in both the plaintext and the ciphertext. This was termed a crash at Bletchley Park.|$|E
25|$|To {{automate}} these logical deductions, the bombe {{took the}} form of an electrical circuit. Current flowed around the circuit near-instantaneously, and represented all the possible logical deductions which could be made at that position. To form this circuit, the bombe used several sets of Enigma rotor stacks wired up together according to the instructions given on a menu, derived from <b>a</b> <b>crib.</b> Because each Enigma machine had 26 inputs and outputs, the replica Enigma stacks are connected to each other using 26-way cables. In addition, each Enigma stack rotor setting is offset a number of places as determined by its position in the crib; for example, an Enigma stack corresponding to the fifth letter in the crib would be four places further on than that corresponding to the first letter.|$|E
50|$|Structures {{contributing}} to the historic nature of the property include a barn, <b>a</b> corn <b>crib,</b> <b>a</b> smoke house, tenant house, a chicken house and an outhouse. Most of the outbuildings were likely constructed before 1860.|$|R

50|$|In 2001 Redman was {{featured}} in an episode of MTV Cribs that showed the rapper's modest, sparsely-decorated home in a middle-class neighborhood, contrasting with the luxurious homes usually featured in the series.

25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|Genie (born 1957) is the {{pseudonym}} for an American feral {{child who}} {{was a victim of}} severe abuse, neglect, and social isolation. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal child psychology. When she was a baby her father concluded that she was severely mentally retarded, a view which intensified as she got older, causing him to dislike her and withhold care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible {{as a result of this}} belief, so from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time he almost always kept her strapped to a child's toilet or bound her in <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> with her arms and legs completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished. The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.|$|E
500|$|William and Florence Dowse raised five sons, {{born between}} 1905 and 1919: Harold, William Jr., Philip, Curtis, and Kermit. [...] After occupying <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> in his parents' bedroom, each son {{moved up to}} the attic room, where they slept on straw ticks.|$|E
50|$|Other {{structures}} {{include an}} 1891 one-room schoolhouse, an 1840 slave cabin, and a 1930 general store, all {{moved to the}} site from elsewhere in Georgia. There is also <b>a</b> corn <b>crib,</b> <b>a</b> house for making bricks, and a smoke house.|$|R
50|$|Other {{buildings}} {{include a}} springhouse, <b>a</b> corn <b>crib</b> and several work areas.|$|R
50|$|Boredom, stress, {{habit and}} {{addiction}} are all possible causes of cribbing and wind-sucking. It was proposed in a 2002 study that {{the link between}} intestinal conditions such as gastric inflammation or colic and abnormal oral behavior was attributable to environmental factors. There is evidence that stomach ulcers may be correlated to a horse becoming <b>a</b> <b>cribber.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was {{received}} favorably by critics, who commended {{the use of}} different samples, and commented {{on the relationship between}} Jay-Z and Beyoncé. Chris Ryan of Spin magazine described [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] as a highlight on The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse, stating that it consists of [...] "a house party in <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> as big as the Georgia Dome." [...] John Bush from AllMusic included the song as a highlight on the album, further describing it as [...] "a slick R crossover with Beyoncé Knowles". Marc L. Hill of PopMatters viewed it as the [...] "obligatory radio song" [...] of the album. Awarding the song a rating of eight out of ten possible points, Dele Fadele of NME complimented it as [...] "a cool duet" [...] between Jay-Z and Beyoncé. John Robinson of the same publication wrote that as the couple describe their life, it's not all [...] "Lexus and sipping Cris". He added, [...] "A similarly relaxed production makes for a behind-the-diamante-net-curtains classic".|$|E
500|$|Simultaneously, Baker {{was cast}} as the title {{character}} in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll (1956), a role initially intended for Marilyn Monroe. Tennessee Williams, who had written and developed the screenplay based on two of his one-act plays, wanted Baker to play the part after seeing her perform a scene from his script at the Actors Studio; likewise, Kazan had been impressed by her performance in All Summer Long on Broadway the year prior. Shot in Benoit, Mississippi, directly after Baker had completed Giant, {{her role in the}} film as a sexually repressed teenaged bride to a failed middle-aged cotton gin owner brought Baker overnight fame and a level of notoriety even before the film's release. In the fall of 1956, artist Robert Everheart, under contract with Warner Bros., constructed a [...] billboard in Times Square promoting the film, depicting the now-iconic image of a scantily clad Baker lying in <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> sucking her thumb. The controversial advertising campaign for the film caused a pre-emptive backlash from religious groups, and on December 16, 1956, Cardinal Francis Spellman of St. Patrick's Cathedral denounced the film and advised his parish against seeing it. A formal condemnation by the Roman Catholic National Legion of Decency ensued, which considered it [...] "grievously offensive to Christian and traditional standards of morality and decency." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{combination}} of <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> foundation with monolithic stone masonry {{worked so well}} that the Lighthouse Board used the design and a similar process in constructing the Stannard Rock Light in Lake Superior in 1878. [...] The Board achieved economies by getting 'double duty' from the [...] "costly apparatus and machinery purchased" [...] for the Spectacle Reef project.|$|E
2500|$|Alan Turing {{designed}} the British bombe {{on a more}} general principle, the assumption {{of the presence of}} text, called <b>a</b> <b>crib,</b> [...] that cryptanalysts could predict was likely to be present at a defined point in the message. This technique is termed a known plaintext attack and had been used to a limited extent by the Poles, e.g., the Germans' use of [...] "ANX" [...] — [...] "AN", [...] German for [...] "To," [...] followed by [...] "X" [...] as a spacer.|$|E

The difference is the difference between <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> and a piece of literature, which is not the less faithful to the original for being a piece of literature." ...|$|E

The homestead includes a dog-trot cabin, a chicken coop, <b>a</b> corn <b>crib,</b> <b>a</b> spring house, and a crude stable.|$|R
50|$|To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus {{that were}} likely to yield an {{excessive}} number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce {{no more than four}} stops per wheel order. This allowed <b>an</b> 8-letter <b>crib</b> for <b>a</b> 3-closure menu, <b>an</b> 11-letter <b>crib</b> for <b>a</b> 2-closure menu and <b>a</b> 14-letter <b>crib</b> for <b>a</b> menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib. The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that turn-over of the middle rotor would have occurred.|$|R
2500|$|Griffith {{was born}} on June 1, 1926 in Mount Airy, North Carolina, {{the only child of}} Carl Lee Griffith and his wife, Geneva (Nunn). As a baby, Griffith lived with {{relatives}} until his parents could afford to buy a home. With neither <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> nor a bed, he slept in dresser drawers for several months. In 1929, when Griffith was three, his father began working as a carpenter and purchased a home in Mount Airy's [...] "blue-collar" [...] south side.|$|E
2500|$|The {{foundation}} {{was laid}} in a cofferdam protected by <b>a</b> <b>crib</b> made from [...] timber and submerged [...] below the surface. [...] The crib was constructed upon slipways at the depot, like building a ship, then launched and towed by tugboats to the reef, {{where it was}} sunk and grounded on the site. This crib is massive: [...] and [...] high (...) [...] It created a protected pond, making a base for the cofferdam, a wharf, and worker's quarters. The cofferdam was pumped out to expose the bedrock, upon which the masonry courses were laid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crew of the}} Air Force Iroquois then {{carried out}} low, slow passes over areas of bush where Gray was {{believed}} to be hiding, carrying armed police and dropping tear gas grenades as it did so, in an attempt to 'flush him out'. The Iroquois crew flew for over eight hours in support of the operation during the day, including positioning police snipers in the surrounding hills. After the initial reconnaissance flight, the ATS moved out as two squads and met up with the Timaru AOS, who were holding positions. The group received fire orders: [...] "if he has a firearm, he is to be shot". Meanwhile, Gray had entered <b>a</b> <b>crib,</b> eaten a small meal and gone to sleep.|$|E
