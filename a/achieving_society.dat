5000|$|David McClelland in his 1961 book, [...] "The <b>Achieving</b> <b>Society</b> [...] " [...] {{identified}} three motivators {{that he believed}} we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power.

According to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).|$|E
50|$|In 1961 McClelland {{published}} The <b>Achieving</b> <b>Society,</b> which articulated {{his model}} of human motivation. McClelland contended that three dominant needs -for achievement, for power, and for affiliation- underpin human motivation. McClelland {{believed that the}} relative importance of each need varies among individuals and cultures. Arguing that commonly used hiring tests using IQ and personality assessments were poor predictors of competency, McClelland proposed that companies should base hiring decisions on demonstrated competency in relevant fields, rather than on standardized test scores. Iconoclastic in their time, McClelland’s ideas have become standard practice in many corporations.|$|E

50|$|Need {{for power}} (nPow) {{is a term}} that was popularized by renowned {{psychologist}} David McClelland in 1961. McClelland's thinking {{was influenced by the}} pioneering work of Henry Murray, who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including needs for achievement, power, and affiliation—and placed these {{in the context of an}} integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray's research, and he continued to further develop Murray's theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland's book The <b>Achieving</b> <b>Society,</b> A-Pow helps explain an individual's imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, social and personal.|$|E

A sampleof 122 consecutive ' 'generations " (or 20 -year periods) {{was drawn from}} European history (540 B. C. to 1900 A. D.). A cross-lagged correlation analysis indicated the following intergenerational influences: (I) political frag-mentation has {{a positive impact on}} the emergence of empiricism, skepticism-criticism-fideism, materialism, temporalism, nominalism, singularism, and the ethics of happiness; (2) war has a negative impact on the appearance of most of these just mentioned beliefs; (3) skepticism-criticism-fideism and perhaps materialism have a positive influence on the appearance of war; and (4) civil disturbances tend to polarizebeliefson all major philosophi-cal issues. Psychologists frequently prefer to think that individual motives, thoughts, and be-haviors have significant repercussions in larger human affairs (e. g., Donley and Winter; Osgood; Simonton, a; cf. Wood). One of the most conspicuous illustrations of this orientation may be McClelland's The <b>Achieving</b> <b>Society</b> where economic prosperity-indeed the very ascent and decline of civilizations-is explained in terms of personal needs and values (also see DeCharms and Moeller). Sociologists, anthropologists, and historians, by comparison, often adopt the position that the causal relation between individual and society operates in the contrary direction-that human dispositions and intentions are the product of sociocultural influences (cf. Sorokin). The most commonplace example of this different orienta-tion is the {{effort on the part of}} many social scientists to show how even individual genius or creativity is but an epiphenomenon of larger sociocultural movement...|$|E

40|$|History {{suggests}} {{that not every}} new technology leads to new hazards and not every new hazard {{is associated with a}} new technology” - Andrew Maynard (2012). Introduction The main goal is: To Promote the Responsible Development of BCGIN S/T – enabled materials, processes, and products, with an approach for helping to ensure that researchers, manufacturers, regulators and others have the necessary information on potential risks and how to prevent, avoid, or mitigate them. The German sociologist Ulrich Beck (1992) has diagnosed contemporary society as showing “organized irresponsibility”: modern technological society allows scientists, engineers and industry to develop and introduce all sorts of new technologies (chemical, nuclear, genetic modification) while it structurally lacks means to hold anyone accountable. The first generation of environmental problems was met in the US, EU and most developed countries largely through a regulatory strategy (government develops standards for <b>achieving</b> <b>society</b> 2 ̆ 7 s environmental goals, applies those standards to categories of pollution sources, establishes mechanisms for overseeing conformance with those standards and then applies punitive sanctions in case of non-conformance). Since the 1980 s, Member States governments also have drawn increasingly on information as a strategy (environmental and health agencies began to use risks communication as a way of informing people about risks), i. e. soft law (communications, action plans and programs, green and white papers, etc.) well developed in the EU Environmental policy and law. The environmental and health risks that may be associated with BCGIN S/T are one of Third-generation problem; First, industrial facilities pollution, and Second, patterns of land use and development, degradation of the global commons. So, BCGIN S/T present complex and distinctive challenges to the public and private institutions responsible for managing environmental and healthy risks in society. Environmental Law (EL) is a collection of principles, rules and regulations dealing with the interaction of human society and nature. The field of EL focuses on the interpretation of these principles related to preventing damage to the land, water, air, living creatures and property, including socio-economic, health and cultural impacts. The field also extends to the rights claimed over and on behalf of land, water, minerals, plants, and animals, determining who gets what and what remains. The EL system is an organized way of using all of the laws in our legal system to minimize, prevent, punish or remedy the consequences of actions which damage or threaten the environment, public health and safety. The field ranges from government regulations to case law and generally accepted principles relating to liability for the release of substances into the environment, intentionally or negligently, which related in harm. Proposal My proposal is based on the two recent cases developed in the EU Environmental law and policy: First is the European Court of Justice (ECJ) Cases: C- 58 / 10 until 68 / 10, Monsanto SAS and others 22 / 03 / 2011. It is about Preliminary ruling on GMO crop emergency measures in France. This reference for a preliminary ruling was made out of eleven (11) joined procedures at the French Council of State and concerned a ban issued by France on cultivation of the GMO corn crop MONO 810. Advocate General (AG) Mengozzi found that the procedure for emergency measures under Article 23 of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC relating to the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs was not applicable. Instead, Regulation EC 1829 / 2003 on Genetically Modified Food and Feed applied in his view. The AG further found that as a consequence, emergency protective measures could only be taken under Article 34 of Regulation. The later provision stipulates that emergency measures can be taken where “it is evident that product ( [...] .) are likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment”. By comparison, Article 23 of Directive would have allowed for emergency measures if a Member State had “detailed grounds for considering that a GMO ( [...] .) constitutes risk to human health or the environment”. After considering that both provision form an expression of the precautionary principle, and considering the explanation given to that principle by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and in EU Legislation, the AG concluded that emergency measures, whatever based on the Directive or Regulation (and despite their differences in wording), can only be taken in cases where the risk is considerable. The precautionary principle however tells that precautionary measures can be taken in case where science is not (yet) able to assess the probability risk at hand. Second is about actual GMOs issue in the EU, i. e. EU Parliament backs national right to cultivation bans. EU Member States should have the flexibility to ban or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified crops and should be able to cite environmental motives for doing so, according to MEPs voting on draft legislation (1 st reading in co-decision procedure; adopted with 548 votes in favor, 84 against and 31 abstentions). “I 2 ̆ 7 m pleased that the EU Parliament has reached on agreement on difficult issue of GMOs, which has been an issue of public concern for years. If the Council manages to find common position, this balanced agreement will allow countries and regions the right to not grow GMOs if they so choose. ” The Commission had proposed to grant EU Member States the right to ban crops on all but health or environmental grounds, which were to be solely assessed by the European Food Safety Authority. Committed to ensuring a firmer legal basis in the context of international trade rules, EP insisted that MS should not be prevented from stating additional environmental grounds. An EU-level safety check and authorization {{will continue to be a}} precondition to a green light for growing GMOs, and its guidelines need updating. Only a strain of GM maize and one modified potato are currently authorized for cultivation in the EU and most MS do not currently grow either crop commercially. Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Germany and Luxembourg have activated a “safeguard clause” in the current EU Directive 2001 / 18 /EC to expressly prohibit cultivation of certain GMOs. Nevertheless, there is one array of increasingly sophisticated materials that are emerging from advances in science, technology, and engineering that do demand careful consideration of the new risks they might pose...|$|E
40|$|The {{background}} {{of this research}} is begin with the statement that Basic Agrarian Legislation of 1960 (UUPA's) forming which use the traditional law (adat law) as main sources and complementary sources is needing the co-existences among UUPA as a state law and traditional law as a folk law’s expectation. Unfortunately, in the process of implementation to realize the land tenure rights in territorial competencies, traditional law was marginalized. It mean prajuru adat as commander of traditional village (desa adat) is never asked to get coordination and be involved deep in the process of realizing the land tenure rights, although traditional village have a siar organization which can disseminate information effectively to traditional of society (krama desa adat). On the contrary, Government is just involve the administrative governance agencies. It is more seen while the Project Operation of Agrarian State (PRONA) policy of government was implemented in Balinese Province which publishes a mass certificate. Thus without unrealized, the legal structure which handle land affair have done partialness to the state law, and ignored the presence of the traditional law. The appearances of the dispute of the right for land tenure and possession is the one of its implication, beside the unclearness of the confession of traditional law society. This research will examine problem including the concept and regulation concerning the right of tenure and possession of adat land, confession and protection by state, and dispute settlement models. The research type that taken in this research is normative legal research comprehends with empirical legal research. It is conformed to the legal problem. Research approach that has been taken in this research is by using statute approach, historical approach, analytical approach, anthropological of law approach and cases approach. The result of this study and research is expected to give an academic thinking contribution in National Law of Land (HTN) renewal. Thus it is practically could improve the legal structure image, and legal culture of society. According to that, {{it can be used to}} anticipate the dispute settlement in land field. This research finding is as follows: First, The supreme tenure of adat land right is lying on the traditional village, not on the banjar adat. That right is including right to manage, arrange, and utilize of land. Basically tenure of adat land is base on the religious communalistic character which controlled by society self regulation autonomous. But it is still vulnerable to states law influences. Moore justifies this problem area as “semi autonomous social field”. Second, there is a shifting power paradigm of tenure right’s sources after Government implemented UUPA, which is originally the tenure rights of traditional village had attributive power into derivative power. The existences of state power on land tenure’s right in UUPA was indicate that hak ulayat of traditional village is based on the states right. It means that the exclusivist character of hak ulayat (beschikkingsrecht) doesn’t get place in National Law. Third, the recognition of adat land existences by states is still weak (weak legal pluralism). This condition become worse because of the contradiction xix interpretation among judges of judicial agents which expected could be functioning as a buffer or safety valve in ways to give certainty to community’s property rights. But the acknowledgment and protection of tenure’s right and laba pura land property can declared for strength (strong legal pluralism). For protection of another adat land is given by their traditional village. Forth, the dispute settlement model of mediation with conflict theory based is will be more proper to used in handling the cases of adat land dispute. But the main point is mediator should be precisely accommodate through harmonizing the distinguish interest to accentuate utility principle of the party. It is differing from litigation stripe which can evoke horizontal’s conflict at traditional village. Fifth, the arising of adat land dispute cases is approximately caused by invalid administration law in land’s rights application decree publication by BPN. And in the fulfillment process of its rights doesn’t involving the prajuru desa adat yet. It is because that publicity principle just reflect states law requirement. It ignores traditional law which has “siar” process pattern, which preceded by mesadok conduct (coordinative function) to special law conduct. Sixth, there is a shifting of land policy in UUPA, which is originally have populist's character in <b>achieving</b> <b>society</b> prosperity to the tending of pro-capital character because of economic growth orientation option. Seventh, the communal character of rights of land that could be certifying by traditional village is just laba pura land. The reason is only tample (pura) has had already recognized as religionist legal entity, which is can have land property’s right according to the Internal Affair Ministry Decree Number SK 556 /DJA/ 1986. Tradisional village itself has no recognition yet as a legal entity. In accordance with that, when HGB (right to utilize building) certificate for adat land which controlled by traditional village, like setra land, adat land, open field, loloan, water resources, campuhan was issued, it is issues on behalf of other subject of law name which usually using a developer for tourism name. Whereas for the communal land which its tenure right has been derivative individually to their traditional of society (known as PKD/AYDS land), is already changed over full individually that finally trade of. In this taste, law with its function as tool of social engineering for giving legal certainty is well done, but not in the context of justice accomplishing and especially for the utility in the religious communal concept. Eighth, there is still no inventorying and mapping activity of adat land in each of traditional village yet. It means that no precisely information yet about the width of adat land which has been mastering and controlling by traditional village. The existence of traditional village jurisdiction power is only shown with natural border, and it is being sensitive for conflict occurring. Ninth, the awareness of adat law’s society as a unity to maintain their tanah ulayat is being sensitive when oppressed or despised to their holy land. Based on that research findings, it conclude that the term “druwe desa” can be formulated as a right which have contain of arrangement, management, using, and exploitation land and its content, and based on the nation right’s authority. Here, the term of “druwe” is correspond with tenure concept which strictly state at article 33 sub paragraph (3) UUD NRI 1945 jo. article 2 sub paragraph (2) UUPA. But they have their own jurisdiction in each traditional village that has been written explicitly in the awig-awig. In awig-awig, the tenure of adat land is still handled by traditional village communally, but also derivatively into individual tenuring (krama) in the form of PKD or AYDS which has “ayahan” xx obligation by traditional village. If PKD or AYDS is converted into a property ownership, then its tenure relationship will changes as ownership relationship according with the concept of property rights in article 16 subparagraph (1) a jo. Article 20 UUPA. Tample land (laba pura), which partly arrange of become the community property rights of druwe (n) desa, is appear as religiosity legal entity as regulated in Internal Affair ministry Decree Number SK/ 556 /DJA/ 1986 State doesn’t recognize and protect adat land wholly yet. After UUPA implementation, there is a shifting of adat land status from communal land into personal ownership. This shifting is unrealized has been reducing authority of traditional village, and remove the status of “ayahan” as obligation or liabilities including in the adat land. It is describe of a poor pluralism. The dispute of land happens because the process of fulfillment of rights by BPN is through an invalid of administrative law mechanism. Here, the function of social engineering of law implementation of UUPA was breach community rights. While internal conflict happens because of by sector ego from their community leader and interpretation of hak ulayat as exclusive rights. Beside that, judicial decision was not continually and even contradictive one another. Dispute settlement model on land field is can be implemented using litigation and non-litigation (mediation) stripe. Mediation will be success if mediator has ability of problems comprehension and ability to identify the problem sources, have a distinct concept, neutral, and ability to harmonizing differ interest into material and immaterial utility. So here will be give legal justice and legal certainty. In comparison with litigation stripe, there is still pro and contra in society after judges giving his judicial decision. It is can caused horizontal conflicts with evoke banjar dissension also. It is needed to act wisely and intelligently of management conflict according to the arisen problem. Thus, here the states agents who do the state function should be able to give recognition and protection to the adat land status existences as a part of hak ulayat of traditional village. Beside that a new paradigm of valuing state law and traditional law as a coordinative (coexistences) position and not in the superlative position for law enforcement agent is needed. The co-existences position is for shows the strong concept of legal pluralism. For the society who want to settle their dispute is should be prepare to receive all the decision through litigation or non litigation stripe. Prajuru adat should have ability of standing in neutral ways and excluded another traditional of society which is not related with (civil) cases to avoiding internal evoke. In order to realizing the recognition and protection from Government to adat land existences, then the head of BPN is should be constitute and appoint traditional village as subject of law which completed with right of land tenure. It is because traditional village has a unique characterize as religious charity entity. Traditional village has Pura Kahyangan Tiga and other pura in their own jurisdiction, except family pura or pura kawitan, and also market land, setra land, open field, road (margi and rurung), water resources (kelebutan toya), loloan, campuhan which can not registered yet. By then, there will be occurring co-existences between UUPA as states law and adat law as folk law. Accordance with that the community based property rights in natural resources management can register to be certified as traditional village name as usually in the context of appoint pura. For PKD land can issued with right to utilize building (HGB), and AYDS issued with usage right xxi (HP) above traditional village land ownership. Hence the effort to shifting PKD and AYDS land into fully individual ownership right as what occurs in this time can be avoided in the future. And there is a way also to avoiding conflict in land affair. In order to UUPA renewal or HTN reforming, the arrangement of community based property rights (traditional village in Balinese Province) can be a part of the property right arrangement which is supposing to achieve legal certainty, legal justice, and legal utility. Thus it is can bring a strong and good bargaining position of adat law society to other party, especially related with outsider party in order to achieve an abundantly prosperity for society...|$|E

The main purpose of this summer school was to help students develop skills in and understanding of th...|$|R

The current environmental challenges and {{the characteristics of the}} labour market mean that the effectiveness of Engineering activities in Geosciences must be increased through the development of technical knowledge and the inclusion of suitable training aimed at solving real cases (European Commission 2010). Human capital – understood as the talents, skills and capabilities of higher education graduates – is perceived as an essential element for sustainable economic growth and development in the globalised economy (Sianesi and Van Reenan 2003). We need, therefore, to rethink our approaches to curriculum, instruction and assessment in science education, particularly because of the rapid growth of the scientific knowledge, tools/technologies and theories that have originated over the last 50 years (Duschl and Grandy 2013) ...|$|R

40|$|Market based {{policies}} are fast becoming the recommended policy panacea {{for all the}} world’s environmental problems. Implicit in such recommendations is the theory that free markets, adjusted for externalities, can always create an “efficient ” allocation of society’s resources. As a result, many contemporary policymakers advocate rolling back regulations in order to let the market protect the environment. There is a fundamental distinction {{between the use of}} the market as a tool to help <b>achieve</b> <b>society’s</b> goals, and as a blueprint for society’s goals; the market is a reasonable policy tool but not a reasonable blueprint. The market as blueprint fails because there are significant public purposes that cannot be achieved by prices and markets alone. Five major arguments show that getting the prices right is often a narrow or meaningless objective; society may intentionally and appropriately choose to “get the prices wrong ” in order to pursue more important goals...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to its {{promising}} properties, hydrogen {{has become}} increasingly interesting for transporta-tion applications. Nevertheless, possible applications also require answers {{to the question of}} how to establish and demonstrate sufficient safety to <b>achieve</b> <b>society’s</b> acceptance and approval of authorities. This paper addresses these questions and is organized as follows: First, we start with a short overview of basic properties of hydrogen and current ideas of using it for aircrafts and cars. After a review of basic risk and safety aspects we then discuss how risk strategies are realized within the automotive sector where the development has progressed significantly during the last years. Next, we describe the tolerable risk target for hydrogen in aircrafts. Finally, we discuss an overall approach which includes the basic philosophy of risk management, the already existing safety concepts, tools and methodologies and also the existing experiences of handling hydrogen in other industries...|$|R
40|$|Translation {{and culture}} {{approaches}} suggest {{the translation of}} culture may form identity of the receiving culture. Focusing on activating cultural resistance and cultural innovation process, this study argues that children’s stories’ translation presents the cultural identity to ensure local wisdoms’ resistance; empowering families and schools for maintaining them. Besides taking a cultural perspective, this study also claims that translation may participate to form cultural identity {{as well as to}} maintain indigenous language. However, semantic limitations imposed by different construction of a cognitive culture system reveal translation barriers. Answering the challenges, this study aims to represent translator’s strategies to <b>achieve</b> <b>society</b> identity using indigenous language expressions. In attempting to formalize and answer the issue, analytic descriptive qualitative embedded within descriptive technique to present data is implemented. As a result, identity-forming power of children’s stories’ translation is manipulated using pragmatic equivalence with a cultural substitute and generic-specific. ...|$|R
