5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} {{is to determine the}} level of quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> with teacher’s efficacy among national primary school teacher’s from Zon Batu Anam, Segamat by gender, length of service and level of education and to determine the relationship between the level of quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> with teacher’s efficacy. Selected number of respondent is 123 from 8 selected national schools in Zon Batu Anam, Segamat. The questionnnaire consist of three sections designed to obtain respondents’ demographic information, quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> teacher’s efficacy. In the context of the study, quality supervision requires knowledge, interpersonal skills, and technical skills. The pilot study indicated the reliability of the items was high with Alpha Cronbach index shown at 0. 961. Data were analysed using SPSS Version 20. 0 to calculate the mean, standard deviation, percentage, t-test, Pearson Correlation, and ANOVA. The results showed overall mean score the level of quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> was high with the mean score 3. 83 and level of teacher’s efficacy was at 3. 95. The results showed that there is no significant differences between level of quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> with gender <b>and</b> level of education but there’s a significant difference for the length of service. The results also showed that there is no significant differences between teacher’s efficacy with all mentioned demographic information. The findings from this study indicated that the relationship between teacher’s efficacy and the level of quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> is weak. Meanwhile, p= 0. 001 < a = 0. 05 which concluded that there is a significant relationship between level of quality teaching <b>and</b> learning <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> teacher’s efficacy among the teachers from national schools in Zon Batu Anam, Segamat...|$|R

Wellman was hired as {{he was the only}} director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience, although Richard Arlen and John Monk Saunders had also served in the war as military aviators. The film was shot on location on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926 and April 7, 1927. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming, including pilots and planes of the United States Army Air Corps which were brought in for the filming and to provide assistance <b>and</b> <b>supervision.</b> Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen on a battlefield made for the production on location. Although the cast and crew had much spare time during the filming because of weather delays, shooting conditions were intense, and Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{a control}} system was {{inspired}} by Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution. Lenin argued that every communist vanguard party, at all levels, needed a system to supervise party-official elections, dismissals and performance. His writings led {{to the establishment of}} the Soviet Central Control Commission; the control system and the Communist Party of China (CPC) structure were imported to China. The importance of discipline <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> was emphasised since the CPC's founding. The 2nd National Congress amended the party constitution, devoting a chapter to party discipline. However, no institution was established to safeguard party norms or supervise cadre behaviour. Until the establishment of the Central Control Commission (CCC) at the 5th National Congress in 1927, local party committees were responsible for supervising members and control commissions were established at the central and provincial level.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might find its way to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance <b>and</b> <b>supervision</b> were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation.
