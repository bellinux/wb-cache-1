40|$|Many {{numerical}} optimization methods use scenario {{trees as}} a discrete approximation {{for the true}} (multi-dimensional) probability distributions of the problem's random variables. Realistic specifications in financial optimization models can lead to tree sizes that quickly become computationally intractable. In this paper {{we focus on the}} two main approaches proposed in the literature to deal with this problem: scenario reduction and state aggregation. We first state necessary conditions for the node structure of a tree to rule out arbitrage. However, currently available scenario reduction algorithms do not take these conditions explicitly into account. State aggregation excludes arbitrage opportunities by relying on the risk-neutral measure. This is, however, only appropriate for pricing purposes but not for optimization. Both limitations are illustrated by numerical examples. We conclude that neither of these methods is suitable to solve financial optimization models in <b>asset-liability</b> or portfolio <b>management.</b> Financial optimization Uncertainty modeling Scenario trees Sparse trees...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} high performance solution method for multistage stochastic convex programming. Stochastic programming is a quantitative tool developed {{in the field of}} optimization to cope with the problem of decision-making under uncertainty. Among others, stochastic programming has found many applications in finance, such as <b>asset-liability</b> and bond-portfolio <b>management.</b> However, many stochastic programming applications still remain computationally intractable because of their overwhelming dimensionality. In this paper we propose a new decomposition algorithm for multistage stochastic programming with a convex objective and stochastic recourse matrices, based on the path-following interior point method combined with the homogeneous self-dual embedding technique. Our preliminary numerical experiments show that this approach is very promising in many ways for solving generic multistage stochastic programming, including its superiority in terms of numerical efficiency, as well as the flexibility in testing and analyzing the model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin 2005...|$|R

40|$|Decision making under {{uncertainty}} {{is a challenge}} faced by many decision makers. Stochastic programming is a major tool developed to deal with optimization with uncertainties that has found applications in, e. g. finance, such as <b>asset-liability</b> and bond-portfolio <b>management.</b> Computationally however, many models in stochastic programming remain unsolvable because of overwhelming dimensionality. For a model to be well solvable, its special structure must be explored. Most of the solution methods are based on decomposing the data. In this {{paper we propose a}} new decomposition approach for two-stage stochastic programming, based on a direct application of the path-following method combined with the homogeneous self-dual technique. Numerical experiments show that our decomposition algorithm is very efficient for solving stochastic programs. In particular, we apply our decomposition method to a two-period portfolio selection problem using options on a stock index. In this model the investor can invest in a money-market account, a stock index, and European options on this index with different maturities.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a bank portfolio management program {{based on the}} complete Markowitz model, which explicitly treats risk due to unanticipated fluctuations in interest rate. Our program takes into account both inter-temporal and intra-temporal covariance. The major result {{of this approach is}} that, for the same expected return, our model yields a portfolio with significantly smaller risk than that determined by an index model. For the same risk level, our method yields a portfolio with higher expected yield. The model employs a rolling planning horizon, with time periods in the planning horizon of arbitrary length. A novelty in the model is that it permits inter-temporal transactions in the portfolio's securities by generating dummy securities to represent every possible transaction over the planning horizon. The output from the model consists of a list of portfolio strategies showing the expected after-tax return and the 1 % worst case yield for each strategy. We also present an illustrative example, using real data from a large Pennsylvania bank, and compare the results from our model to the simpler variance-only and index models. The principles upon which the model is based are sufficiently general to allow the program to be expanded into a general <b>asset-liability</b> balance sheet <b>management</b> program...|$|R
40|$|Mean-variance {{criterion}} in optimization AL problem aims at {{maximizing the}} final surplus; asset value minus liability value, {{subject to a}} given variance of the final surplus or, equivalently, minimizing the variance of the final surplus subject to a given expected final surplus. The stochastic optimal control theory is employed to analytically solve the AL management problem in continuous-time setting. Then the comparison of derived optimal AL management policy and the literatures are examined and the discrepancy in objectives between equity holders and investors of a mutual fund is discussed finally. Portfolio selection in <b>asset-liability</b> (AL) <b>management</b> is to seek the best allocation of wealth among a basket of securities with {{taking into account the}} liabilities. There are a lot of portfolio selection criteria among in the literature. The two of them are mean-variance criterion and Roy's safety-first principle. This thesis investigates the optimal asset allocation for an investor who is facing an uncontrollable liability under either one of these two portfolio constructions. The relation between these two different principles are discussed in the context of AL management. Roy's safety-first principle (Roy, 1956) asserts that the investor would specify a threshold level of the final surplus below which the outcome is regarded as disaster. The objective is then to minimize the ruin probability or the chance of disaster subject to a constraint that the expected final surplus is higher than the threshold. Roy however solves this problem by minimizing an upper bound of the ruin probability based on the Bienayme-Chebycheff inequality. With the same consideration of Roy, the analytical trading strategy of the safety-first. AL management, problem, in the sense of surplus, under both continuous- and multi-period-time settings are derived. We link this surrogated safety-first principle to the mean-variance ones. The final objective of this thesis attacks the genuine safety-first AL problem. Without replacing the ruin probability in the objective function by its upper bound, we use a martingale approach and consider the funding ratio which is the total wealth divided by the total liability. Two important situations in the literature are investigated. In the first situation, the mean constraint of the original problem is removed, We show that removing the mean constraint makes the problem become a target reaching problem that can be solved analytically. However, the essence of safety-first is lost. In the second case in which the mean constraint is there, the problem becomes ill-posed and is then solved using an approximation using a martingale approach. The approximation relies {{on the assumption that the}} investor gives up unreasonably high profits and sets an upper bounded for the final funding ratio. Chiu, Mei Choi. "July 2007.

Using canonical correlation analysis, we examine how the relationships between asset and liability accounts at U. S. commercial banks changed between 1990 and 2005. Importantly, we show that asset-liability linkages are weaker for banks that are intensive users of risk-mitigation strategies such as interest rate swaps and adjustable loans. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that asset-liability linkages are stronger at large banks than at small banks, although these size-based differences have diminished over time, both because of increased asset-liability linkages at small banks and decreased linkages at large banks.

40|$|Both {{academic}} and practical approaches to <b>asset-liability</b> <b>management</b> employ {{a sequence of}} distinct procedures to value liabilities and determine the asset allocation. First, a discount rate that is usually dictated by accounting or other regulatory standards is used to value liabilities. Second, the asset allocation is determined by maximising some objective function in the surplus of assets over liabilities, taken as given the valuation of liabilities. We argue that this procedure is inconsistent, since the employed discount rate used to compute {{the present value of}} future liability promises does not reflect the true risk of failing to deliver these promises because this depends, in part, on the asset allocation chosen. To deal with this issue, we propose a model that allows for the joint valuation of liabilities and the determination of the optimal asset allocation using discount rates that appropriately reflect the default risk.
