5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E

Possibly from the very start of the castle, and certainly by the 1380s, the castle buildings formed three distinct complexes supporting the Earl's household, the castle's constable <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the Embleton barony respectively. The inside of the bailey still shows the marks of former strip farming, which can be seen in winter.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, but Washington largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and economic stability. Dissonance over Hamilton's proposals also irrevocably broke the relationship between Washington and Madison, who had served as the president's foremost congressional ally {{during the first year}} of his presidency. Opponents of Hamilton <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> won several seats in the 1792 Congressional elections, and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{influenced}} by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne {{on the issue of}} Tyler's promotion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of India. She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled so as not to conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive, but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889.|$|E

5|$|The first kingdom's {{government}} {{consisted of}} the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (Abbu) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> The second kingdom was a monarchy, but {{little is known about}} it {{because of a lack of}} written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.|$|E
5|$|The queen {{shared the}} running of affairs of state with the king. The crown prince was {{involved}} in internal matters and the second prince was involved in foreign affairs. Most duties, including military ones, were handled by the vizier <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration,</b> which consisted of 13 court dignitaries—each of whom controlled between 400 and 800 men forming a bureaucracy with 11,700 people. Each of the four quarters of the lower city was governed by a chief inspector and many deputies. To oversee royal interest, the king employed agents (mashkim), collectors (ur) and messengers (kas).|$|E
5|$|While still a major general, Shoup was {{unexpectedly}} {{nominated to}} become Commandant of the Marine Corps by President Dwight D.

To prepare for this duty he was promoted to lieutenant general on 2 November 1959, and briefly assigned duties as Chief of Staff, Headquarters Marine Corps. He was elevated to general on 1 January 1960, upon assuming the post as the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. He would later serve under the administration of John F.

5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, Robertson was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 7th Military District, which encompassed the Northern Territory. It was his first command since the First World War. He was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel in August 1939, and this became substantive in November. The job involved cooperation with the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of a company of regular soldiers known as the Darwin Mobile Force. After the Second World War began in September 1939, Robertson became responsible for supplying the 7th Military District's quota of volunteers for the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). A strike on the waterfront saw Robertson committing troops to help unload cargo.|$|E

5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
5|$|Moreno {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1778. His father was Manuel Moreno y Argumosa, born in Santander, Spain, who arrived in the city in 1776 and married María del Valle. Mariano was the firstborn of the Moreno family, and had {{thirteen}} brothers. During his youth he studied Latin, logic, and philosophy at San Carlos Royal College, followed by college studies of law at Chuquisaca. During these studies, he learned the new ideas of the Spanish Enlightenment. He married María Guadalupe Cuenca and returned to Buenos Aires, becoming a prominent lawyer for the Cabildo. Unlike most other criollos, he rejected the Carlotist project <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of Santiago de Liniers, joining instead the ill-fated mutiny of Álzaga against him. He worked for the next viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. He wrote the economic paper The Representation of the Landowners, which persuaded the viceroy to open trade with Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Order {{remained}} in collateral {{branches of the}} family of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, but, under the Salic law practiced in the northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband—who was also her distant relative—John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.|$|E
