By comparing the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (European Council, 2006), its related monitoring reports and the ´Facing the future: {{time for the}} EU to meet global challenges` (Boden et al., 2010) report, we can conclude that many identified future-oriented issues cover topics well reflected in sustainability indicator systems. Such comparison can help policy-making in view of developing better understanding on unsustainable trends and respective need for correction or prevention. Our findings suggest also that data collection could be enhanced to better monitor emerging issues currently not well covered by indicator systems. Today’s sustainability indicator systems offer information on past and present states but provide limited support to understand future developments. Combining sustainability monitoring with forward-looking activities (FLA) could therefore enhance policy support in developing more adaptive and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to better orient societal change towards sustainable development.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Corporate {{governance}} {{has become}} an issue of global significance. The improvement of corporate governance practices is widely {{recognized as one of}} the essential elements in strengthening the foundation for the long-term performance of countries and corporations. This study suggests that companies wishing to remain profitable and sustainable in the future should take a strategic and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> to corporate governance. Anticipatory corporate governance requires companies to change short-term orientated decision-making practices to long-term profitable and sustainable policies with insight, vision and strategic foresight. The best candidates to shape a strategic and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> towards good corporate governance practices are those who are expected to implement it – the board of directors. Taking an <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> to governance means that the board must co-design the future of their company by making decisions based on informed trends, evidence-based quantitative analyses and the expert opinion, experience and insight by its directors. The independent non-executive director plays a vital role in this process, as he/she provide specialist skills and bring objective reflection, constructive criticism and external judgment on issues of strategy and standards of conduct and evaluation. Strategic foresight has the potential to assist and empower independent non-executive directors in taking an anticipatory and strategic approach to corporate governance as it provides them with the capability to understand, interpret and respond to current challenges, and to conceive and explore as yet unimagined approaches and solutions to these problems to ensure a profitable and sustainable. The study put forward an instructional intervention – The Art of Shapeshifting – aimed specifically at South African independent non-executive directors by providing them with the skills, knowledge and foresight that will eventually translate into increased personal development awareness of the need for sustainable development and good corporate governance. The basic premise of this intervention is that a change in corporate law and corporate governance recommendations needs to be matched by a change in human behaviour. A new mind-set is required by directors to anticipate and prepare for the future. The researcher proposes a process of “shapeshifting” that requires a futures orientation, with strong strategic foresight capability and capacity, founded on flexible and adaptable systems within an anticipatory governance framework. Thus, the main aim of the research is to design, develop and implement the shapeshifting framework as an instructional intervention in order to assist South African independent nonexecutives in taking an <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> to corporate governance using strategic foresight as core competence. It consequently evaluates whether participation in the intervention would lead to a change in the knowledge, altruism, attitude, values, socially responsible behaviour, skills, behaviour and empowerment of independent non-executive directors with regard to directorial duties and good corporate governance practice. This in turn would contribute to an increased awareness of sustainable development, and the need for futures-orientated <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> to corporate governance. The research results show that the shapeshifting intervention is seen to make an overall positive contribution to improved knowledge, altruism, attitude of independent non-executive directors with regard to sustainable development, their duties and responsibilities, and a more futures-orientated approach. The shapeshifting intervention also has an impact on changing attitudes and values towards sustainable development, corporate citizenship and corporate governance. The results also indicate that the shapeshifting intervention assists in the empowerment of independent nonexecutive directors through the use of strategic foresight to initiate and sustain good corporate governance in practice.

To adapt to these environmental changes, farmers must adjust their management strategies and remain competitive while also satisfying societal preferences for sustainable food systems. Representing and modeling farmers’ decision-making processes by including adaptation, when representing farmers’ practices,is therefore an important challenge for the agricultural research community. Bio-economic and bio-decisional approaches have addressed adaptation at different planning horizons in the literature. We reviewed approximately 40 articles using bio-economic and bio-decisional models in which strategic and tactical decisions were considered dynamic adaptive and expectation-based processes. The main results of this literature survey are as follows: i) adaptability, flexibility and dynamic processes are common ways to characterize farmers’ decision-making, ii) adaptation can be a reactive or a proactive process depending on farmers’ flexibility and expectation capabilities, and iii) different modeling approaches are used to model decision stages in time and space, and some approaches can be combined to represent a sequential decision-making process.

The sample comprised 35 students who were interviewed through probing and questioning techniques. The questions led to converging responses, which were segregated into themes. A large majority of students felt advising was absent or mismanaged, while some also were of the view that schools did not prepare them to enjoy the benefits of extracurricular activities; many students further viewed English or the Foundation Program (preparatory year’s program) a barrier to their continuation in higher education.

40|$|We propose an {{improved}} approach to dynamic configuration of resource-aware applications. The new anticipatory model of configuration maximizes utility based on three inputs: user preferences, application capability profiles, and resource availability. In this respect, the proposed model {{is similar to}} a model of configuration described in [2]. However, the latter addressed the dynamic nature of the problem by reacting to changes (such as decrease in resource availability), and maximized the utility in a point-wise manner. The newly proposed <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> explicitly models the duration of the task and leverages possible information about the future (such as stochastic resource availability over the expected duration of the task). We expect that the anticipatory model will improve user’s utility, conserve scarce resources, and reduce the amount of disruption to the user resulting from changes when compared to the reactive model. However, the optimization problem underlying the anticipatory model is computationally more difficult than the problem underlying the reactive model. We would like to investigate if the <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approach</b> is feasible and efficient in practice while delivering the above-mentioned improvements.

40|$|Abstract Background Large-scale {{intervention}} programmes {{to control}} or eliminate several infectious diseases are currently underway worldwide. However, a major unresolved question remains: what are reasonable stopping points for these programmes? Recent theoretical work has highlighted how the ecological complexity and heterogeneity {{inherent in the}} transmission dynamics of macroparasites can result in elimination thresholds that vary between local communities. Here, we examine the empirical evidence for this hypothesis {{and its implications for}} the global elimination of the major macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, by applying a novel Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit a dynamic model of the transmission of this parasitic disease to field data from nine villages with different ecological and geographical characteristics. Baseline lymphatic filariasis microfilarial age-prevalence data from three geographically distinct endemic regions, across which the major vector populations implicated in parasite transmission also differed, were used to fit and calibrate the relevant vector-specific filariasis transmission models. Ensembles of parasite elimination thresholds, generated using the Bayesian fitting procedure, were then examined in order to evaluate site-specific heterogeneity in the values of these thresholds and investigate the ecological factors that may underlie such variability Results We show that parameters of density-dependent functions relating to immunity, parasite establishment, as well as parasite aggregation, varied significantly between the nine different settings, contributing to locally varying filarial elimination thresholds. Parasite elimination thresholds predicted for the settings in which the mosquito vector is anopheline were, however, found to be higher than those in which the mosquito is culicine, substantiating our previous theoretical findings. The results also indicate that the probability that the parasite will be eliminated following six rounds of Mass Drug Administration with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole decreases markedly but non-linearly as the annual biting rate and parasite reproduction number increases. Conclusions This paper shows that specific ecological conditions in a community can lead to significant local differences in population dynamics and, consequently, elimination threshold estimates for lymphatic filariasis. These findings, and the difficulty of measuring the key local parameters (infection aggregation and acquired immunity) governing differences in transmission thresholds between communities, mean that it is necessary for us to rethink the utility of the current <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approaches</b> for achieving the elimination of filariasis both locally and globally. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Pertamina {{is often}} in the {{spotlight}} due to various major crises. The most interesting crisis case {{is the process of}} managing the Mahakam block that has been rolling over the past eight years although now Pertamina has got legal umbrella from the government. The process of managing the Mahakam Block led to various reactions, some were supportive and dubious if the management of the Mahakam Block originally undertaken by Total and Inpex was taken over by Pertamina. Crisis management is generally done by public relations (PR), but in Pertamina the role is union. Researchers would like to know the role of United Pertamina Workers Union Federation (FSPPB) in corporate crisis management through lobbying and negotiation strategy in the case of managing the Mahakam block. The research method used is qualitative approach with case study. The researcher uses a pattern matching technique to connect the qualitative data obtained with the concept already built in the frame of thought. The subjects examined were unions who were members of the FSPPB and stakeholders of the Mahakam Block crisis. The result of the research is FSPPB in the case of Mahakam Block performing crisis management role with lobbying strategy and negotiation to various stakeholders. The lobbying strategy consists of brainstorming, conditioning, networking, institution building, cognitive problem, five breaking, power manipulation, cost and benefit, and futuristic or <b>anticipatory</b> <b>approaches.</b> Negotiation strategy is win-lose, which FSPPB is the winner while the ESDM Ministry is the loser. The techniques used are making the agenda of official forums, making deadlines with intimidation, good guy bad guy by exchanging certain roles (wiseman, sniper, observer), and requesting concession to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and Pertamina's Board of Directors. FSPPB lobby and negotiate to stakeholders for having a role in crisis management. This study adds the concept that unions can have a role in crisis management. This role will be greatly enhanced by the Joint Working Agreement (PKB) which contains the union's special roles, so as to strengthen the union's trade union position in managing corporate crises. In Pertamina, FSPPB has a special role to play in maintaining the company's business continuity and striving for Indonesian energy sovereignty. As for lobby strategy dominant and effectively used by FSPPB in this case study is power manipulation approach, meanwhile the negotiation strategy is win-lose with good guy bad guy technique. ...|$|R

40|$|My {{work was}} {{motivated}} by two main ideas that can be summarized in two sentences. The first key sentence is “anticipation is not matter of a single mechanism in a living organism- it happens on many different levels”. The second pillar of my work {{is the fact that}} “anticipation happens even without voluntary control”. The combination of these two sentences is the most important point in my work and together forms my original approach to anticipation. I believe that this brings novelty for the anticipation theory. Naturally research of anticipation {{at the beginning of this}} decade was focused on the anticipatory principles bringing advances on the field itself. This allowed me to build on those, look at them from a higher perspective, and use not one, but several levels of anticipation in a creature design. In this work I will present my unified theory for anticipation and describe eight different types of anticipation ordered in a semi-hierarchical structure. I call this approach the 8 -Factor Anticipation. This presents another original idea in this work and that is the agent architecture that has anticipation built in almost every function. I will describe these categories and demonstrate them in detail with examples and verify them in simulations. My 8 -factor <b>anticipatory</b> behaviour <b>approach</b> is based on the curren...|$|R
40|$|Despite early {{warnings}} about “knowledge-enabled mass destruction” {{and the ongoing}} battle over agricultural biotechnology, the development of nanotechnology in Europe has been remarkably quiet over the past decade: non-governmental organization (NGO) campaigns against “nano” were all but inexistent and the wider public appears largely uninterested in nanotechnology. Why has Europe’s experience with nanotechnologies been so fundamentally different from that with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) ? This article argues that differences in the technologies as such cannot fully explain this divergence. Instead, a convergence of interests across key groups of stakeholders, the institutional evolution of the European Union (EU) and the experience from the GMO case enabled and facilitated a highly <b>anticipatory</b> and proactive <b>approach</b> to nanotechnology risk governance. This approach, marked by early capacity building, stakeholder involvement and gradual regulation succeeded in avoiding public polarization and in promoting a responsible development of nanotechnologies...|$|R
