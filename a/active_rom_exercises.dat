30|$|Based on the aforementioned, {{it would}} be {{safe to say that}} our working {{hypothesis}} was confirmed: Early ankle ROM exercises and PWB mobilization after uncomplicated medial StD seem to provide better functional results than those achieved by longer periods of immobilization, as already mentioned in literature. As joint instability, following closed reduction of medial subtalar dislocation, is not a possible complication, protracted immobilization only adds to joint stiffness and minimizes ankle and foot functionality. In contrast, early <b>active</b> <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> may help the ligaments and the tendons of the site to heal without compromising proprioception of the joint.|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Myofascial {{pain and}} {{dysfunction}} syndrome (MPDS) is presently {{considered to be}} the leading diagnosis amongst pain management physicians and the leading diagnosis amongst pain sufferers reporting to general practitioners (Harden, Bruehl, Gass, Niemiec & Barbick, 2000). The goal of dry needling and the other above mentioned soft tissue treatments is to alleviate the MTrP’s in the muscle, thereby restoring the muscle to its normal tissue mobility and returning it to proper functional capacity (Travell & Simons, 1999). A post-needling protocol may be used to reduce post-needling soreness at the needling site, to facilitate tissue repair after needling and to normalise muscle function and ROM after needling (Travell & Simons, 1999). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the efficacy of dry needling on its own and in combination with a widely prescribed post-needling protocol of heat, active range of motion (ROM) exercises and passive stretches, with regards to changes in pressure pain threshold, pain and cervical spine ranges of motion, to determine which the superior treatment is. Participants who went to the University of Johannesburg Chiropractic Day Clinic were eligible to participate in the study once they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were recruited by means of word of mouth as well as with the use of advertisements that were placed around the respective campuses of the University of Johannesburg. Thirty participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups, each consisting of 15 participants.

40|$|Modified {{constraint}} {{induced movement}} therapy is {{a focus of}} rehabilitation research for stroke survivors with hemiplegia that relies on physically constraining a patient's unaffected limb to modify a patient's behavior and force {{the use of the}} affected limb in a rehabilitation setting. In this study, we attempt to cognitively induce a constraint in patients engaging in virtual therapy via a Kinect and Unity based platform. The platform included four games that each utilized a different active range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercise</b> for control of game objects. Five stroke survivors with hemiparesis were recruited for a two week study consisting of five, 25 -minute therapy sessions each. Users were allowed to use either their unaffected or affected limb to play each game at any time and allowed their choice of games during each session. For each game, the difficulty level remained at baseline while the user used their affected side to play but the difficulty was increased at varying rates when the user used their unaffected side to play. Results were evaluated for compliance to the therapy (usage rate of affected side), choice of games, performance, efficacy of therapy (ROM), and qualitative behavior of users. Compliance during virtual mCIT seems to be higher than that of traditional mCIT but a more extensive user test is necessary to validate this result. ROM measurements did not provide a clear trend due to the small size and duration of the data set. Trends were found in several areas of user behavior: (1) users preferred games utilizing only one axis of control and not reliant on orientation of the limb, (2) users also tended to play games in a certain order, (3) user performance increased over time, and (4) users often incorrectly performed the desired <b>active</b> <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> for each game which may indicate the necessity to observe and coach patients during virtual rehabilitation...|$|R

Methods. Thirty patients with JIA and 20 healthy age-matched controls (mean age ± SD, 11. 3 ± 2. 4 versus 11. 0 ± 2. 3, resp.; P> 0. 05) were included. All patients performed aerobic walking (4 {{days a week for}} 8 weeks) and <b>active</b> and passive <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> of involved joints. All patients completed the childhood health assessment questionnaire (CHAQ) and the child health questionnaire. ROM measurements of joints were performed by using universal goniometer. Aerobic capacity was determined by measuring peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) during an incremental treadmill test. Results. Peak oxygen uptake and exercise duration were significantly lower in JIA group than in controls (32. 5 ± 6. 6 versus 35. 9 ± 5. 8 and 13. 9 ± 1. 9 versus 15. 0 ± 2. 0, resp.; P< 0. 05 for both).

The subjects were 18 DMD patients (21. 3 ± 4. 1 years old). The jaw <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> consisted of therapist-assisted training (2 times a week) and self-training (before each meal every day). The therapist-assisted training consisted of the application of a hot pack on the cheek of the masseter muscle region (15 minutes), the massage of the masseter (10 minutes), and jaw <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> (5 minutes). The self-training involved jaw <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> by opening the mouth to the maximum degree, ten times. These trainings continued for six months.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Physical therapy {{treatment}} following Total knee Arthroplasty (TKA) {{consists of}} a combination of strengthening and range of motion exercises. The exercise technique, church pew exercise (CPE), has been proposed to enhance quadriceps facilitation and improve function. This is a technique that has the patient standing and rocking forward/back. The backward motion is arrested by engagement of the upper calf against a solid object, creating a sudden flexion torque at the knee and a sudden extension torque at the hip. The combination of CPE with standard physical therapy is claimed to provide better quadriceps control and faster walking post TKA. In this case study, a 51 -year-old female with decreased knee active and passive range of motion (ROM), decreased lower extremity (LE) muscle strength, and limited ambulation post left knee TKA, received conventional physical therapy treatment plus CPE. Methods: The patient received 11 physical therapy home sessions. The first 8 sessions were used to strengthen her knee and increase <b>active</b> and passive <b>ROM.</b> The CPE intervention was performed 3 weeks post-surgery, during the last 3 physical therapy sessions. At these three sessions the patient performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) before and after CPE. Outcomes: At initial evaluation, 4 days post left knee TKA, this patient’s left knee <b>active</b> <b>ROM</b> was only 15 to 76 degrees, and manual muscle testing at her hip and knee indicated strengths of 2 - (hip flexors), 3 - (hamstrings and quadriceps), and 3 + (hip abductors), all out of 5, and her times on two trials of the TUG were 30. 31 and 30. 65 sec, indicating impaired functional ability. At all CPE sessions (3 weeks post-surgery) the patient demonstrated increased gait speeds (i. e. shorter times) on the TUG after the CPE (pre CPE mean = 13. 2 sec; post CPE mean = 11. 2), increased stance time on her affected lower extremity, and increased step length on her contra-lateral lower extremity. The patient reported increased knee stability. Clinical Relevance: Rationale for CPE is based on neurological facilitation of quadriceps and other lower extremity muscles. However, to engage in this exercise the patient must have the ability to balance and to control the hip and knee joints. This patient required several weeks of strengthening and <b>active</b> and passive <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> before she could perform the CPE. Once able to perform the CPE, she demonstrated improvements in her walking ability, and she expressed greater confidence. Conclusion: Provided a minimal level of strength and <b>active</b> and passive <b>ROM</b> has been attained, CPE may be a valuable short-term supplement to current strengthening regimens addressing quadriceps functional deficits following TKA. Other conditions that involve gait problems related to quadriceps insufficiency might also benefit. The long-term efficacy of CPE remains to be determined...|$|R

[Subjects and Methods] In total, twenty-six 9 -week-old adult male Wistar rats were used in this study. The rats were randomly divided into three groups, the immobilization group (n= 10), ex-ercise group (n= 10), and control group (n= 6). The immobilization group and exercise group were anaesthetized and operated on under sterile conditions.

The preferred method of preventing muscle loss is isometric exercises that put zero strain on the knee. Knee extension within two weeks is important with many rehab guidelines.|$|R
50|$|During a reset, every paged ROM is {{switched}} in {{and asked}} how much public and private workspace it needs. Each ROM is allocated a chunk of private workspace that remains allocated at all times, and a single block of public workspace, equal {{to the size of}} the largest request, is made available to the <b>active</b> <b>ROM.</b> During operation, the paged area is rapidly switched between ROMs when file system commands are issued and unrecognised commands are put to the OS.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on twenty patients of age between 40 - 65 year of adhesive capsulitis to compare caudal and antero-posterior glide mobilisation technique {{for the improvement of}} abduction range of motion, pain relief, and improvement in ADL‟S. Significant improvement in abduction <b>active</b> <b>ROM</b> & passive ROM as well as alleviation in pain and disability was observed, when end range mobilisation was administered for three weeks. It was further observed that caudal glide was more effective than the antero-posterior glide...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background and Purpose: Elbow {{fractures}} {{amount to}} 4. 3 % {{of all the}} fractures. The elbow is prone to stiffness after injury and fractures can often lead to significant functional impairment. Rehabilitation is commonly used to restore range of motion (ROM) and function. Practice patterns in elbow fracture rehabilitation have not been defined. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe current elbow fracture rehabilitation practices; and compare those to the existing evidence base. Methods: Hand therapists (n= 315) from the USA (92 %) and Canada (8 %) completed a web-based survey on their practice patterns and beliefs related to the acute (0 - 6 weeks) and functional (6 - 12 weeks) phases of elbow fracture rehabilitation. Results: More than 99 % of respondents agreed that fracture severity, co-morbidities, time since fracture, compliance with an exercise program, psychological factors, and occupational demands are important prognostic indicators for optimal function. Strong agreement was found with the use of patient education (95 %) and <b>active</b> <b>ROM</b> (86 %) in the acute stage while, home exercise programs (99 %), <b>active</b> <b>ROM</b> (99 %), stretching (97 %), strengthening (97 %), functional activities (ADLs and routine tasks) (97 %), passive ROM (95 %), and <b>active</b> assisted <b>ROM</b> (95 %) were generally used in the functional stage. The most commonly used impairment measures were goniometry (99 %), Jamar dynamometry (97 %), and hand held dynamometry (97 %). Agreement on the use of patient-reported outcome measures was very minimal (1. 3 %- 35. 6 %) ...|$|R
2500|$|Initial {{physical}} therapy consists {{of range of}} motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercises,</b> often with the guidance of a physical therapist.
