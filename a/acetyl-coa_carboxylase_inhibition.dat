40|$|SummaryMice null for Fyn (a {{member of}} the Src family of nonreceptor {{tyrosine}} kinases) display a reduced percentage of adipose mass associated with decreased adipocyte cell size. In parallel, {{there is a substantial}} reduction in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and free fatty acids concomitant with decreased intrahepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid accumulation. Importantly, the Fyn null mice exhibit improved glucose tolerance resulting from increased peripheral tissue (adipose and skeletal muscle) insulin sensitivity with a very small effect in the liver. Moreover, whole-body, adipose, and skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation are increased along with AMP kinase activation and <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> <b>inhibition.</b> Together, these data demonstrate crosstalk between Src-family kinase activity and fatty acid oxidation and show that the loss of Fyn markedly improves peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity by relieving a selective negative modulation of AMP kinase activity in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic de-novo {{lipogenesis}} is a {{metabolic process}} {{implemented in the}} pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Clinically, the rate of this process can be ascertained by use of labeled acetate and stimulation by fructose administration. A systems pharmacology model {{of this process is}} desirable because it facilitates the description, analysis, and prediction of this experiment. Due to the multiple enzymes involved in de-novo lipogenesis, and the limited data, it is desirable to use single functional expressions to encapsulate the flux between multiple enzymes. To accomplish this we developed a novel simplification technique which uses the available information about the properties of the individual enzymes to bound the parameters of a single governing ‘transfer function’. This method should be applicable to any model with linear chains of enzymes that are well stimulated. We validated this approach with computational simulations and analytical justification in a limiting case. Using this technique we generated a simple model of hepatic de-novo lipogenesis in these experimental conditions that matched prior data. This model can be used to assess pharmacological intervention at specific points on this pathway. We have demonstrated this with prospective simulation of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> <b>inhibition.</b> This simplification technique suggests how the constituent properties of an enzymatic chain of reactions gives rise to the sensitivity (to substrate) of the pathway as a whole...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{role of the}} AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK), a highly conserved stress-activated kinase, in the regulation of ketone body production by astrocytes was studied. AMPK activity in rat cortical astrocytes was three times higher than in rat cortical neurons. AMPK in astrocytes was shown to be functionally active. Thus, incubation of astrocytes with 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), a cell-permeable activator of AMPK, stimulated both ketogenesis from palmitate and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. This was concomitant to a decrease of intracellular malonyl-CoA levels and an inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase/fatty acid synthesis and 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase/cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, in microdialysis experiments AICAR was shown to stimulate brain ketogenesis markedly. The effect of chemical hypoxia on AMPK and the ketogenic pathway was studied subsequently. Incubation of astrocytes with azide led to a remarkable drop of fatty acid β-oxidation. However, activation of AMPK during hypoxia compensated the depression of β-oxidation, thereby sustaining ketone body production. This effect seemed {{to rely on the}} cascade hypoxia → increase of the AMP/ATP ratio → AMPK stimulation → <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> <b>inhibition</b> → decrease of malonyl-CoA concentration → carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deinhibition → enhanced ketogenesis. Furthermore, incubation of neurons with azide blunted lactate oxidation, but not 3 -hydroxybutyrate oxidation. Results show that (a) AMPK plays {{an active role in the}} regulation of ketone body production by astrocytes, and (b) ketone bodies produced by astrocytes during hypoxia might be a substrate for neuronal oxidative metabolism.

Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} malignant types of human primary tumor and has a poor prognosis, therefore, the development of novel therapeutic modalities is necessary. Fatsioside A is a novel baccharane-type triterpenoid glycoside, which is extracted from the fruits of Fatsia japonica. Previous data has revealed that fatsioside A can exert growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis in human glioma cells. However, no detailed investigations have been performed to determine its action on human hepatocellular cells, and the exact mecha-nisms underlying the induction of apoptosis remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of fatsioside A in the HepG 2 human HCC cell line, and to investigate the underlying mecha-nisms by focusing on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling cascade. The results of the present study demonstrated that fatsioside A induced apoptotic death of the human HepG 2 HCC cells, which was associated with a marked activation of AMPK and increased expression of the downstream <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> <b>carboxylase.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of AMPK by RNA interference or by its inhibitor, compound C, suppressed fatsioside A-induced caspase- 3 cleavage and apoptosis in the HepG 2 cells, while AICAR, the AMPK activator, elicited marked cytotoxic effects.

The weight-reducing effects of galegine have not previously been studied and the present investigation was undertaken to determine its mechanism(s) of action. Body weight and food intake were examined in mice. Glucose uptake and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity were studied in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and L 6 myotubes and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity was examined in cell lines. The gene expression of some enzymes involved in fat metabolism was examined in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Galegine administered in the diet reduced body weight in mice. Pair-feeding indicated that at least part of this effect was independent of reduced food intake. In 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and L 6 myotubes, galegine (50 mM- 3 mM) stimulated glucose uptake. Galegine (1 - 300 mM) also reduced isoprenaline-mediated lipolysis in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and L 6 myotubes. Galegine (500 mM) down-regulated genes concerned with fatty acid synthesis, including fatty acid synthase and its upstream regulator SREBP. Galegine (10 mM and above) produced a concentration-dependent activation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) in H 4 IIE rat hepatoma, HEK 293 human kidney cells, 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes and L 6 myotubes. Activation of AMPK can explain many of the effects of galegine, including enhanced glucose uptake and inhibition of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of acetyl-CoA carboxylase both inhibits fatty acid synthesis and stimulates fatty acid oxidation, and this may to contribute to the in vivo effect of galegine on body weight...|$|E

40|$|The {{activation}} of hepatic <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> by Na(+) -cotransported amino acids such as glutamine has been attributed {{mainly to the}} stimulation of its dephosphorylation by accumulating dicarboxylic acids, e. g. glutamate. We report here on a hepatic species of protein phosphatase- 2 A that activates <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> {{in the presence of}} physiological concentrations of glutamate or Mg 2 + and, under these conditions, accounts for virtually all the hepatic <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> phosphatase activity.

40|$|Acetyl {{coenzyme}} A (<b>acetyl-CoA)</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity, amount, and mRNA levels increase {{during the}} differentiation of 30 A- 5 preadipocytes to adipocytes. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) completely prevents this differentiation, with concomitant <b>inhibition</b> of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> mRNA accumulation. To investigate the {{mechanisms by which}} TNF prevents <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> mRNA accumulation, we determined the effect of TNF on the transcription rate of the carboxylase gene and the half-life of carboxylase mRNA. Nuclear runoff transcription assays revealed no differences {{in the number of}} RNA polymerase molecules actively engaged in transcription of the <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> gene in preadipocytes, adipocytes, TNF-treated preadipocytes, or {{at any time during the}} course of differentiation. However, changes in adipsin, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and actin mRNAs, whose levels are also differentiation dependent, can be accounted for in part by changes in the number of polymerase complexes on their respective genes. To determine whether TNF caused a decrease in the stability of carboxylase RNA transcripts, we measured the rate of decay of prelabeled <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> mRNA. Control and TNF-treated cells showed no difference between the apparent half-lives of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> mRNAs (9 h). However, the rate of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> mRNA synthesis in vivo was decreased three- to fourfold in the presence of TNF. These data demonstrate that TNF prevents accumulation of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> mRNA during preadipocyte differentiation by decreasing the rate of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> gene transcription. However, transcriptional control is not due to a change in the number of RNA polymerase complexes actively engaged in carboxylase transcript elongation which could be measured by a number runoff assay.

40|$|<b>Acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> catalyses the rate-limiting {{reaction}} in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis {{in a wide}} variety of organisms. In plants however, the significance of this enzyme in regulating de_ novo fatty acid biosynthesis is unknown. In this investigation <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> of maize, barley and spinach leaves has been studied in order to compare some features of this enzyme in the three plants. In maize, <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> is located in chloroplasts, where it occurs as a soluble enzyme in the stromal fraction. Both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells also exhibit <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity. Activities of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> in isolated chloroplasts have been compared to rates of lipid synthesis from acetate in order to investigate the role of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> in regulating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis from acetate. Although <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity was higher than that expected from the rate of acetate incorporation into lipids of isolated chloroplasts of maize and barley, the opposite was found for chloroplasts isolated from spinach. In chloroplasts from the emerging leaves of maize seedlings, lipid synthesis was maximal with chloroplasts isolated from the leaf segment corresponding to leaf greening. However, a relationship between leaf development and <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity was less apparent. Consequently a regulatory role for <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis could not be directly established from a comparison of the rates of lipid synthesis and <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activities. An alternative approach to the establishment of a regulatory role for <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> was to purify the enzyme from maize and barley leaves, and study its response to variable concentrations of substrates, products and certain cellular metabolites. Purification of both enzymes was performed by identical procedures, including polyethylene glycol fractionation, hydrophobic chromatography and gel filtration. <b>Acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> from both maize and barley leaves appeared to be an integral enzyme, as no evidence for its dissociation was found, contrary to the findings of the bacterial enzyme. The kinetic properties of the partially purified enzyme from maize and barley were very similar. The apparent Michaelis constants for the substrates, acetyl-CoA and HCO- 3, were about 0. lmM and 2 mM, respectively for both enzymes. The enzymically active form of the substrate, ATP, was found to be Mg. ATP. Furthermore, free ATP inhibited enzymic activity, while free Mg 2 +, activated the enzyme from both plant sources. Monovalent cations, particularly K+, were positive effectors of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> on the other hand, the products of the <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> reaction, malonyl-CoA and ADP were inhibitors.

Hence, we investigated the short-term alterations in energy metabolism caused by metformin administration in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. We found that metformin inhibited mitochondrial respiration, although ATP levels remained constant as the decrease in mitochondrial production was compensated by an increase in glycolysis. While AMP/ATP ratios were unaffected by metformin, phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> augmented. The <b>inhibition</b> of respiration provoked a rapid and sustained increase in superoxide levels, despite the increase in UCP 2 and superoxide dismutase activity. The inhibition of respiration was rapidly reversed by fatty acids and thus respiration was lower in treated cells in the presence of pyruvate and glucose while rates were identical to control cells when palmitate was the substrate. We conclude that metformin reversibly inhibits mitochondrial respiration, it rapidly activates AMPK without altering the energy charge, and it inhibits fatty acid synthesis. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is facilitated by reversing the inhibition of complex I and, presumably, by releasing the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase.

This pattern of enzyme distribution was observed in male rats only; in females, the periportal/perivenous ratio of enzyme mass was nearly equal. The periportal/perivenous gradients for <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> ATP citrate-lyase and fatty acid synthase observed in fed (and fasted) males were abolished when animals were fasted (48 h) and refed (30 h) with a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet. As determined by enzyme assay of eluates obtained from the livers of normally feeding male rats, there is also periportal zonation of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity, expressed either as units per mg of eluted protein or units per mg of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> protein, suggesting the existence of gradients in both enzyme mass and specific activity. From these results, we conclude that the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis are zonated periportally in the liver of the normally feeding male rat...|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> (measured in a crude supernatant fraction) caused by insulin treatment of adipocytes was completely {{unaffected by the}} addition of a large amount of highly purified protein phosphatase to the supernatant fraction. Under the same conditions the <b>inhibition</b> of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> by adrenaline was totally reversed. Experiments with 32 P-labelled adipocytes showed that insulin increased the total phosphorylation of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> from 2. 7 to 3. 5 molecules of phosphate/ 240 kDa subunit, and confirmed that this increase was partially accounted for by phosphorylation within a specific peptide (the 'I-site' peptide). Protein phosphatase treatment of the crude supernatant fractions removed over 80 % of the 32 P radioactivity from the enzyme and removed all detectable radioactivity from the I-site peptide. The effect of insulin on <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity, but not the effect on phosphorylation, was lost on purification of the enzyme on avidin-Sepharose. The effect on enzyme activity was also lost if crude supernatant fractions were subjected to rapid gel filtration after treatment under conditions of high ionic strength, similar to those used in the avidin-Sepharose procedure. These results show that, although insulin does increase the phosphorylation of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> at a specific site, this does not cause enzyme activation. They suggest instead that {{activation of}} the enzyme by insulin is mediated by a tightly bound low-Mr effector which dissociates from the enzyme at high ionic strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of two lipogenic enzymes, <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and fatty acid synthase, were determined in two transplantable mammary adenocarcinomas (13762 and R 3230 AC) carried by non-pregnant, pregnant and lactating rats, and in mammary tissue of control animals (non-tumour-carrying) of comparable physiological states. During mammary-gland differentiation of control or tumour-carrying animals, the {{activities of}} <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and fatty acid synthase in the lactating gland increased by about 40 [...] 50 -fold over the values found in non-pregnant animals. On the other hand, in tumours carried by lactating dams there were only modest increases (1. 5 [...] 2 -fold) in <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> and fatty acid synthase compared with the neoplasms carried by non-pregnant animals. On {{the basis of the}} Km values for different substrates and immunodiffusion and immunotitration data, the fatty acid synthase of neoplastic tissues appeared to be indistinguishable from the control mammary-gland enzyme. However, a comparison of the immunotitration and immunodiffusion experiments indicated that the mammary-gland <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> might differ from the enzyme present in mammary neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{content of}} <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> [acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6. 4. 1. 2] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is reduced by}} the addition of long-chain fatty acids to the culture medium. Mutant strains of S. cerevisiae defective in acyl-CoA synthetase [acid:CoA ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6. 2. 1. 3] were isolated and used to determine whether fatty acid itself or a metabolite of fatty acid is more directly responsible for the repression of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase.</b> Cells of the mutant strains were capable of incorporating fatty acid to an extent comparable to that observed with the wild-type strain, but they accumulated markedly more of the incorporated fatty acid in the nonesterified form than did the wild-type cells. The level of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase</b> activity in the mutants, in contrast to that in the wild-type strain, was hardly affected {{by the addition of}} fatty acids to the medium. These results indicate that the activation of exogenous fatty acid is required for the repression of <b>acetyl-CoA</b> <b>carboxylase,</b> supporting the view that the repressive effect is mediated by some compound metabolically derived from fatty acid...|$|R
