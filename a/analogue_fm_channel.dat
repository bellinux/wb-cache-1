40|$|The audio quality, {{robustness}} {{and complexity}} issues {{of a novel}} mobile digital audio broadcast (DAB) scheme are addressed. The audio codec {{is based on a}} combination of subband coding (SBC) and multipulse excited linear predictive coding (MPLPC), where the bit allocation is dynamically adapted according to both the signal power in different subbands and a perceptual hearing model. Typically a segmental signal to noise ratio (SEGSNR) in excess of 30 dB associated with high fidelity (HI-FI) subjective quality was achieved for 2. 67 bits/sample transmissions at a mono bit rate of 86 kbits/s. Four different source-matched forward error correction (FEC) schemes were investigated in order to explore the complexity, bit rate and robustness trade-offs. When using 4 bit/symbol 16 -level star-constellation - quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -StQAM) the overall signalling rate became approximately 30 kBd, accommodating two stereo DAB channels in a conventional 200 kHz <b>analogue</b> <b>FM</b> <b>channel's</b> bandwidth. Our diversity assisted DAB scheme required a channel signal to noise ratio (SNR) of about 25 dB for unimpaired audio quality via the worst-case Rayleigh fading mobile channel, when the mobile speed was 30 mph and the propagation frequency was 1. 5 GHz. In case of the stationary Gaussian scenario an SNR of about 20 dB was required...|$|R
50|$|The DMR Association and {{manufacturers}} often claim that DMR has superior coverage performance to <b>analogue</b> <b>FM.</b> Forward error correction can achieve a higher quality of voice when the receive signal is still relatively high. In practice, however, digital modulation protocols {{are much more}} susceptible to multipath interference and fail to provide service in areas where <b>analogue</b> <b>FM</b> would otherwise provide degraded but audible voice service. At a higher quality of voice, DMR outperforms <b>analogue</b> <b>FM</b> by about 11 dB. But at a lower quality of voice, <b>analogue</b> <b>FM</b> outperforms DMR by about 5 dB.|$|R

5000|$|Since 1 November 2011 P1 has had {{to share}} its {{nationwide}} <b>FM</b> <b>channel</b> frequencies with P2 since DR lost the rights to continue {{the use of the}} fourth nationwide <b>FM</b> <b>channel</b> which P2 had been using.

5000|$|DR {{subsequently}} {{lost the}} rights to continue {{the use of the}} fourth nationwide <b>FM</b> <b>channel</b> from 2011, which meant DR only had room for three of their four <b>FM</b> <b>channels.</b> DR therefore decided that P1 and P2 must share the nationwide <b>FM</b> <b>channel</b> that P1 had been using, starting on 1 November 2011. On the same day DR P2 became DR P2 Klassisk. Both channels continued as two separate channels digitally on DAB and online.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{digital signal}} {{processing}} {{has been used to}} enhance the <b>analogue</b> <b>FM</b> audio quality then <b>analogue</b> <b>FM</b> generally outperforms DMR in all situations, with a typical 2-3 dB improvement for [...] "high quality" [...] voice and around 5 dB improvement for [...] "lower quality" [...] voice. Where {{digital signal processing}} is used to enhance analog FM audio, the overall [...] "delivered audio quality" [...] is also considerably better than DMR. However DSP processing of analog FM audio does not remove the 12.5 kHz requirement so DMR is still more spectrally efficient.|$|R
