2500|$|The French {{preliminary}} bombardment by four [...] and [...] guns, {{began on}} 17 May and by 21 May, the French artillery commander {{claimed that the}} fort had been severely damaged. During the bombardment the German garrison in the fort experienced great strain, as French heavy shells smashed holes in the walls and concrete dust, exhaust fumes from <b>an</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generator</b> and gas from disinterred corpses polluted the air. Water ran short but until 20 May, the fort remained operational, reports being passed back and reinforcements moving forward until the afternoon, when the Bourges Casemate was isolated and the wireless station in the north-western machine-gun turret burnt down. Conditions for the German infantry in the vicinity were far worse and by 18 May, the French destructive bombardment had obliterated many defensive positions, the survivors taking post in shell-holes and dips on the ground. Communication with the rear was severed and food and water ran out {{by the time of}} the French attack on 22 May. The troops of Infantry Regiment 52 in front of Fort Douaumont had been reduced to [...] near Thiaumont Farm and German counter-barrages inflicted similar losses on French troops. French aircraft attacked eight observation balloons and the 5th Army headquarters at Stenay on 22 May. Six balloons were shot down but the German artillery fire increased and twenty minutes before zero hour, a German bombardment began, which reduced the 129th Infantry Regiment companies to about [...] each.|$|E

40|$|Regenerative braking is a {{function}} to recharge power bank on the Plug-in electric vehicles (PHEV) and electric vehicles (EV). The weakness of this system is, it can only perform its function when the vehicle is slowing down or by stepping the brake foot pedal. In other words, the electricity recharging system is inconsistent, non-continuous and geography dependent. To overcome {{the weakness of the}} regenerative braking system, it is suggested that to apply another generator {{which is going to be}} parallel with the regenerative braking system so that continuous charging can be achieved. Since the ironless <b>electricity</b> <b>generator</b> has <b>a</b> less counter electromotive force (CEMF) comparing to <b>an</b> ironcored <b>electricity</b> <b>generator</b> and no cogging torque.

AFPM, one of the coreless <b>electricity</b> <b>generator</b> configuration has <b>a</b> less counter electromotive force (CEMF) compare to the cored <b>electricity</b> <b>generator.</b> AFPM configuration also has no cogging torque and low starting torque. Application of <b>a</b> coreless <b>electricity</b> <b>generator</b> is the most suitable compare to the cored <b>electricity</b> <b>generator.</b> However, {{it is expected that}} the elimination of the ferrite material within the coreless <b>electricity</b> <b>generator</b> itself increases the power generation.
