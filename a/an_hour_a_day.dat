5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all {{former high}} {{officials}} of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard. The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five. Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and were not permitted to address each other or their guards. As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation. Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.|$|E

25|$|Remark {{that the}} {{concepts}} 'access' and 'improved' are not unequivocal. The definitions {{used by the}} WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation do not necessarily coincide {{with those of other}} surveys or national policies. The government of Burkina Faso, for instance, takes into account aspects such as waiting time and water quality. In fact, almost half of the Sub-Saharan households that according to WHO/UNICEF 'have access to improved water supply', spend more than half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> collecting the water. Although this loss of time is mentioned in the WHO/UNICEF report, it does not affect their 'improved' vs. 'non-improved' distinction.|$|E

25|$|God-fearers are {{considered}} to be of significant importance to the popularity of the Early Christian movement. They represented a group of gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to one degree or another. However, they were not converts, but a separate gentile community, engaged in Judaic religious ideas and practices. Actual conversion to Judaism would require adherence to all of the Laws of Moses, which includes various prohibitions (kashrut, circumcision, Sabbath observance etc.) which were generally unattractive to would-be gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unpopular in Classical civilization because it was the custom to spend <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> or so exercising in the nude in the gymnasium and males {{did not want to be}} seen in public deprived of their foreskins.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E

He was only allowed to film in the store at night while it was closed (from 10:30p.m. to 5:30a.m.), hence the plot point of the shutters being closed due to a vandal having jammed gum in the padlocks. Because Smith was working at Quick Stop {{during the day and}} shooting the film at night, he slept no more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> By the end of the 21-day shoot, Smith was unable to stay awake while some of the most climactic scenes of the film were shot.|$|E

2500|$|Obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) is {{a mental}} disorder where people {{feel the need}} to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called [...] "rituals"), or have certain thoughts repeatedly. People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur {{to such a degree that}} the person's daily life is negatively affected. Often they take up more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.
