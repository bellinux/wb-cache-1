The game allows online users to answer questions seen on the actual show. <b>Answering</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of questions correctly allows players to level up and face more difficult questions; a total of 34 levels are available.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} <b>answering</b> <b>a</b> new series of questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is {{given a chance to}} answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before <b>answering.</b> <b>A</b> correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions is a non-fiction book by Randall Munroe {{in which}} the author answers {{hypothetical}} science questions sent to him by readers of his webcomic, xkcd. The book contains a selection of questions and answers originally published on his blog What If?, along with several new ones. The book is divided into several dozen chapters, {{most of which are}} devoted to <b>answering</b> <b>a</b> unique question. What If? was released in September 2, 2014 and was received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (often informally called Millionaire) is an American {{television}} {{game show}} {{based on the}} same-titled British program and developed for the United States by Michael Davies. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by <b>answering</b> <b>a</b> series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program has endured {{as one of the}} longest-running and most successful international variants in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise.|$|E
5000|$|Mokken scaling {{belongs to}} Item {{response}} theory. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of Guttman scale. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling {{can be used}} to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are {{based on the assumption that}} the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of [...] "difficulty". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that <b>a</b> respondent who <b>answered</b> <b>a</b> difficult question correctly is assumed to <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> easy question correctly.The key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that every respondent who <b>answered</b> <b>a</b> difficult question affirmatively will necessarily <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who <b>answered</b> <b>a</b> difficult question affirmatively are more likely <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.|$|R

5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. When he was a toddler, his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. <b>Answering</b> <b>a</b> complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two people he had ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. <b>Answering</b> <b>a</b> question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, <b>answering</b> <b>a</b> {{petition}} {{signed by}} a group of cultural personalities from Iași, Metropolitan Daniel (the future Patriarch of All Romania) signed a decision to posthumously revert the decision to exclude Ion Creangă from among the Moldavian clergy. The public polled during a 2006 program produced by the Romanian Television nominated Creangă 43rd among the 100 greatest Romanians. New monuments honoring the writer include a bust unveiled in Târgu Neamț, the work of sculptor Ovidiu Ciobotaru. The patrimony associated with Creangă's life has also sparked debates: local authorities in Târgu Neamț were criticized for not maintaining the site near his house in its best condition, while the Fălticeni where he once lived was controversially put up for sale by its private owners in 2009, at a time when city hall could not exercise its pre-emption right.|$|E
