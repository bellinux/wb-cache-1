40|$|A {{case study}} of a 25 -year {{old man with a}} three-day history of {{intermittent}} generalized abdominal pain, persistent nausea and slight vomiting is hereby described. The clinical investigations established the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis complicated by a severe hemolytic anemia due to a different antibody of HI-specificity. The treatment consisted of a transfusion of four units of packed cells and started on oral prednisolone in a daily dosage of 40 mg. There was a rapid improvement in his symptoms and a return of the temperature to normal. The patient's hemolytic anemia followed the pattern described by Dacie (1960). An acute onset with high fever, rapidly advancing anemia and jaundice is characteristic. Hemoglobinuria is uncommon, but has been reported in at least four cases (Dacie, 1960). It is of great interest that the patient did not show evidence of <b>anti-i</b> <b>antibody</b> activity.

40|$|Multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) offer {{great promise}} for future {{regenerative}} and anti-inflam-matory therapies. Panels of functional and phenotypical markers are currently used in characterization of differ-ent therapeutic stem cell populations from various sources. The i antigen (linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine) from the Ii blood group {{system has been}} suggested as a marker for MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB). However, there are currently no commercially available antibodies recognizing the i antigen. In the present study, we describe the use of antibody phage display technology to produce recombinant antibodies recognizing a structure {{from the surface of}} mesenchymal stem cells. We constructed IgM phage display libraries from the lym-phocytes of a donor with an elevated serum anti-i titer. Antibody phage display technology is not dependent on immunization and thus allows the generation of antibodies against poorly immunogenic molecules, such as car-bohydrates. Agglutination assays utilizing i antigen–positive red blood cells (RBCs) from UCB revealed six prom-ising single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies, three of which recognized epitopes from the surface of UCB-MSCs in flow cytometric assays. The amino acid sequence of the VH gene segment of B 12. 2 scFv was highly similar to the VH 4. 21 gene segment required to encode anti-i specificities. Further characterization of binding properties revealed that the binding of B 12. 2 hyperphage was inhibited by soluble linear lactosamine oligosaccha-ride. Based on these findings, we suggest that the B 12. 2 scFv we have generated is a prominent <b>anti-i</b> <b>antibody</b> that recognizes i antigen on the surface of both UCB-MSCs and RBCs.

40|$|Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} systemic mycosis in Latin America. Patients with PCM show {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical and pathological manifestations depending on both host and pathogen factors. Two clinical forms of the disease are recognized: the acute or juvenile form and the chronic or adult form. the major antigenic component of the parasite is a glycoprotein of 43 kDa (gp 43). All patient sera present antibodies against gp 43 (anti-gp 43) and, as demonstrated before by our group, spontaneous anti-idiotypic (<b>anti-Id)</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Ab 2) can be detected in patient sera with high titers of anti-gp 43. Since it has been postulated that <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> may have a modulating function, we decided to purify and characterize <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> in this system. the possible correlation of Ab 2 titers with different clinical forms of disease was also verified. Results showed that purified human <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> (human Ab 2) recognized specifically the idiotype of some murine monoclonal anti-gp 43 (17 c and 3 e) but not others (40. d 7, 27 a, and 8 a). Spontaneous <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> were found in all clinical forms of disease. the majority of patients (88 %, n = 8) with the acute form of PCM had high titers of Ab 2. However, among patients with the multifocal chronic form of the disease, only 29 % (n = 14) had high titers of Ab 2; 70 % (n = 10) of patients with the unifocal chronic form had low titers of Ab 2. A correlation between Ab 2 titers and anti-gp 43 titers was observed before and during antimycotic treatment.

40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} induce immune responses against encoded proteins, {{and have}} clear potential for cancer vaccines. For B-cell tumours, idiotypic (Id) immunoglobulin encoded by the variable region genes provides a target antigen. When assembled as single chain Fv (scFv), and fused to an immunoenhancing sequence from tetanus toxin (TT), DNA fusion vaccines induce <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In lymphoma models, these antibodies have {{a critical role}} in mediating protection. For application to patients with lymphoma, two questions arise: first, whether pre-existing antibody against TT affects induction of anti-scFv antibodies; second, whether individual human scFv fusion sequences are able to fold consistently to generate antibodies able to recognize private conformational Id determinants expressed by tumour cells. Using xenogeneic vaccination with scFv sequences from four patients, we have shown that pre-existing anti-TT immunity slows, but does not prevent, <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibody</b> responses. To determine folding, we have monitored the ability of nine DNAscFv–FrC patients' vaccines to induce xenogeneic <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Antibodies were induced in all cases, and were strikingly specific for each patient's immunoglobulin with little cross-reactivity between patients, even when similar VH or VL genes were involved.

An anti-idiotypic antibody was raised against the idiotype of an azobenzenearsonate (ABA) -specific antibody of A/J mice. The anti-idiotypic antibody was subcutaneously (s. c.) administered to syngeneic mice prior to challenge with ABA-coupled polyacrylamide beads injected into the intestinal wall. The results of such a challenge were assessed histologically for granuloma formation at 24 -h intervals. Mice primed with <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibody</b> and challenged with ABA-linked beads developed epithelioid granulomas at 72 and 96 hr post-challenge. Unprimed mice or mice primed with control antibodies did not develop granulomas when challenged with ABA-linked beads.

The results were compared with humoral and cellular responses of the same patients to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In acute hepatitis B, the responses to HBsAg, were delayed until 3 - 4 weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms. However, the leucocyte migration inhibition (LMI) and the lymphocyte transformation (LTT) responses to affinity purified anti-HBs {{were found to be}} evolved very early in the course of acute hepatitis B, though <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> were absent.

Injection of minute amounts of <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{has been shown}} in several experimental systems to induce antigen-specific helper T cells (1 - 4) and to enhance the expression of the corresponding Id in subsequent antibody responses (5 - 9).

We also found that a cytotoxic T-cell response was not induced by either in vivo administration of vaccine alone or by the vaccine plus interleukin- 2. In addition the injection of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associate antigen did not prolong dormancy.

Each of the anti-Id sera was directed predominantly towards a unique (private) idiotype of the immunizing MAb, none of the five idiotypes being detectable in pooled BALB/c antisera against Mem 71 H-BelN virus or on most other anti-HA MAbs tested. Partial idiotypic sharing was observed, however, between certain MAbs, from different mice, having the same or similar epitope specificity for HA. When used as immunogens in BALB/c mice, {{two of the five}} <b>anti-Id</b> preparations induced <b>antibodies</b> that reacted with Mem 71 H-BelN virus and displayed neutralizing activity.

Herein, we describe the molecular cloning, bacterial expression, and functional properties of an <b>anti-Id</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (mAb), designated K 2 - 3 f, which possesses an internal image of cocaine within its variable regions. The heavy and light chain variable domains of K 2 - 3 f were cloned by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a single chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) was assembled for expression in Escherichia coli. The scFv bound to the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) with moderate affinity (Ka= 5. 3 × 106 M− 1) and excellent mimicry of the cocaine molecule completely inhibited cocaine binding at a molar concentration closely resembling in vivo conditions while allowing approximately 90 % of equimolar dopamine uptake.

Reactivity to these two antigens segregated with the 16 <b>anti-i</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies,</b> which were derived from the near germline V 4 - 34 gene. All <b>anti-i</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> bound B lymphocytes, albeit with varying intensities. B-cell binding correlated with basic amino acids in the VH-CDR 3.

After a rest period of 8 - 12 wk, the hyperimmunized, suppressed (HIS) mice develop high concentrations of suppressor T cells with anti-Id receptors (4, 5). The T cells of HIS mice that have been allowed to rest for a shorter period of time elaborate molecules with idiotypic or anti-Id receptors, either of which can suppress the CRIA component of the humoral anti-Ar response (6). In the present report, we show that when T cells from HIS mice are transferred into female mice just before mating, their offspring, when immunized shortly after birth, are unable to produce CRIA, although their capacity to make anti-Ar antibodies is unimpaired. In addition, the sera of HIS mice contain soluble factor(s) which, when transferred into adult mice, selectively suppress the formation of anti-Ar antibodies expressing CRIA...|$|R
40|$|From the serum of 10 {{allergic}} subjects we {{have prepared}} IgG antibodies recognizing idiotopes carried by specific antibodies to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dpt) allergens, and studied cross-reactivity of anti-Dpt IgG bystander and antigen-binding site-associated idiotopes by latex agglutination assays. Idiotopes of specific anti-Dpt IgE {{were evaluated by}} radioimmunoassays. Depending on the assay, a binding or inhibition of more than 50 %, {{as compared to the}} reactivity of specific antibodies with the corresponding anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) IgG, was considered significant. Cross-reactivity of antigen-binding site-associated idiotopes attained a mean proportion of 6 / 10 for IgG and 9. 6 / 10 for IgE. By contrast, bystander idiotopes cross-reacted only occasionally with a mean proportion of 2 / 10 for both IgG and IgE <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> from two subjects have been isolated by adsorption on insolubilized anti-Dpt antibodies of the corresponding patient. Using this purified material we have confirmed that (a) the majority of <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> carry an "internal image" of the initial antigen and compete in a dose-dependent manner with Dpt allergens for the binding to the anti-Dpt antibodies and (b) paratope-associated idiotopes of anti-Dpt antibodies are shared by unrelated individuals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rabbits were inoculated with affinity-purified human {{antibodies}} {{to the common}} house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DPT) to produce anti-idiotypic (Id) antibodies. The Id carried by human IgE antibodies were studied in a radioimmunoassay in which specific anti-DPT IgE were first insolubilized on rabbit F(ab') 2 fragments against human Fc epsilon. In a single individual specific anti-DPT IgE antibodies shared bystander idiotopes (i. e. idiotopes located outside the antigen-binding site) with IgG antibodies of the same specificity, since the adsorption on insolubilized anti-DPT IgG almost completely eliminated the binding of <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> to IgE. This differed from our previous observations (J. -M. R. Saint-Remy et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 1986. 16 : 575) wherein distinct paratope-associated idiotopes were identified on IgG and IgE anti-DPT antibodies. The frequency of cross-reactions between idiotopes of anti-DPT IgE antibodies observed in ten unrelated individuals was less than 10 % for bystander idiotopes. This finding confirmed the private character of the above idiotopes that we found earlier on anti-DPT IgG <b>antibodies.</b> However, one <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibody</b> preparation was found to react with bystander idiotopes of anti-DPT IgE of most individuals, thereby suggesting {{the existence of a}} recurrent idiotope. The low frequency of inter-individual bystander idiotope cross-reactivity contrasted with the public character of paratope-associated idiotopes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Anti-idiotypic (<b>anti-Id)</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{were raised}} against three {{protective}} monoclonal antibodies, each with specificity for the variable antigen type (VAT) of a clone of Trypanosoma rhodesiense. The IgG 1 fractions of each were pooled and administered to BALB/c mice 3 - 4 wk before homologous challenge. The course of primary parasitemia was altered in 19 of 30 anti-Id-treated animals. The immunity was manifested as either: (a) complete protection, (b) reduced parasitemia, or (c) selection against parasites bearing the original VAT. The three idiotypes (Id) {{were found in}} variable levels in serum {{during the course of}} infection in control animals. However, in all anti-Id-treated mice that displayed immunity, one Id in particular (7 H 11) was detectable much earlier in infection and in higher levels than in control mice or anti-Id-treated, nonimmune mice. Six of nine mice treated with the anti- 7 H 11 Id alone also displayed immunity, manifested in this case exclusively as selection against parasites bearing the original VAT. The effect was again associated with the more rapid appearance of the Id after infection. Specificity of the anti-Id-induced immunity was supported by the failure of anti- 7 H 11 Id treatment to alter the course of infection with a heterologous clone of T. rhodesiense. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the antigen-independent induction of antimicrobial immunity using <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{tolerance}} specific for anti-phosphorylcholine (PC) x is induced in BALB/e mice by {{two methods}} (1) : by injecting immunologically immature mice with either PC-antigen as described for the classical tolerance induction (2), or antibody {{directed against the}} idiotype of TEPC 15 myeloma protein (T 15 Id), which is antigenieally identical to the major idiotype (Id) of the anti-PC antibody (3). Spleen cells from animals made unresponsive by either method displayed a similar active suppression of anti-PC response of normal spleen cells. The active suppression appeared to be mediated by suppressor T cells (1). Suppressor T cells (Ts) induced in animals receiving <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibodies</b> appear to express surface determinants similar to the <b>anti-Id</b> <b>antibody</b> (4 - 6), whereas Ts induced by antigens exhibit Id-bearing receptors specific for the antigen (7 - 9). The possible complementarity in the idiotypic-anti-idiotypic recognition signals of antigen-specific and Id-specific Ts led us to examine the functional interaction between the two populations of Ts induced independently by neonatal injection of either PC-antigen or anti-T 15 Id antibody. We report here that individual Ts activities can be neutralized when Ts bearing anti-idiotypic receptors are preexposed to Ts bearing idiotypic receptors. Therefore, Jerne's network hypothesis (10), based on Id-anti-Id interactions for stimulation and regulation of immune responses, may also {{be applied to the}} regulation of Ts activity...|$|R

Anti-Id 88 was able to stimulate specific cell-mediated immunity against anti-Id 88, as well as CVB 3, and exerted a suppressive effect on the proliferation of mixed spleen cell populations from virus-exposed mice. Anti-Id stimulated an anti-anti-Id antibody 3 population able to bind antibody 2 F(ab') 2 fragments or virus antigen in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

40|$|Different {{homogeneous}} IgM cold agglutinins (two anti-I, two anti-i and one anti-Il cross-reacting antibodies) {{have been}} used to determine the antigen site densities of adult I and i erythrocytes and of cord red cells. The equilibirium constants and the thermodynamic constants of these reactions have been determined. The two <b>anti-I</b> <b>antibodies,</b> which did not combine with i or cord red blood cells, recognized two different determinants on I red cells. The antigen density of the I Fla. receptor was 120, 000 sites per erythrocyte and the standard enthalpy change (-deltaH degrees) of the reaction was 18 to 25 kcal/mole. The antigen density of the I Loi. determinant varied according to the red cells tested and the enthalpy change (-deltaH degrees) of these reactions was 50 - 65 kcal/mole. The i and cord erythrocytes reactive structures were more heterogeneous than those present on I erythrocytes. The equilibrium constants rapidly decreased as the temperature rose and the standard enthalpy changes (-deltaH degrees) ranged from 50 to 90 kcal/mole. Two types of i determinants were observed; one of the <b>anti-i</b> <b>antibodies</b> reacted mainly with an i component present on cord erythrocytes, the other antibody reacted with a different i component present on i adult red-cells.
