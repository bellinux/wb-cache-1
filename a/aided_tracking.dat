40|$|Background Poverty {{is highly}} {{concentrated}} in countries affected by armed conflict {{which are the}} furthest from reaching the Millennium Development Goals. <b>Tracking</b> <b>aid</b> patterns for health is crucial for improving the effectiveness of external aid to countries affected by armed conflict which tend to depend heavily upon external assistance and also have particularly acute health needs. Objectives This study systematically assesses the reliability of global aid databases which are commonly used for <b>tracking</b> <b>aid</b> to countries affected by armed conflict. It offers analyses of two main databases - the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and the Financial Tracking System (FTS) by reviewing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of these data sources. Methods A literature review was conducted to assess the existing evidence on <b>aid</b> <b>tracking</b> generally, and <b>aid</b> databases more broadly. Interviews were also conducted with experts involved in health resource tracking, donor agencies, and NGOs. Results Despite limitations, the CRS and FTS are appropriate for <b>tracking</b> <b>aid</b> for conflict-affected countries as they are comprehensive and allow analysis of different aid activities, countries, years, and donors. Conclusions The study offers recommendations on how CRS and FTS might be enhanced to try and improve the accountability and effectiveness of aid to countries affected by armed conflict.

50|$|As an {{integral}} part of the international search and rescue satellite program called COSPAS-SARSAT, NOAA operates the Search and Rescue Satellite <b>Aided</b> <b>Tracking</b> (SARSAT) System to detect and locate mariners, aviators and other recreational users in distress almost anywhere in the world at any time and under almost any conditions. This system uses a network of satellites to detect and locate distress signals from emergency beacons onboard aircraft, vessels and from handheld personal locator beacons (PLB). The SARSAT transponder on the GOES-16 satellite will provide the capability to immediately detect distress signals from emergency beacons and relay them to ground stations - called Local User Terminals. In turn, this signal is routed to a SARSAT Mission Control Center and then sent to a Rescue Coordination Center which dispatches a search and rescue team to the location of the distress.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Search and Rescue Satellite <b>Aided</b> <b>Tracking</b> information, the AFRCC computer system contains resource files that list federal and state organizations, which can conduct or assist in SAR efforts throughout North America. When a distress call is received, the center investigates the request, coordinates with federal, state, and local officials, and determines the type and scope of response necessary. Once verified as an actual distress situation, the AFRCC requests support from the appropriate federal SAR force. This may include Civil Air Patrol, United States Coast Guard, or other Department of Defense assets, as needed. State agencies can be contacted for state, local, or civil SAR resource assistance within their jurisdiction. The AFRCC chooses the rescue force based on availability and capability of forces, geographic location, terrain, weather conditions, and urgency of the situation.|$|E

40|$|Target {{tracking}} in {{an urban}} environment presents a wealth of ambiguous tracking scenarios that cause a kinematic-only tracker to fail. Partial or full occlusions in areas of tall buildings are particularly problematic as there is often no way to correctly identify the target with only kinematic information. Feature <b>aided</b> <b>tracking</b> attempts to resolve problems with a kinematic-only tracker by extracting features from the data. In the case of panchromatic video, the features are often histograms, {{the same is true}} for color video data. In the case where tracks are uniquely different colors, more typical feature aided trackers may perform well. However, a typical urban setting has similar size, shape, and color tracks, and more typical feature aided trackers have no hopes in resolving many of the ambiguities we face. We present a novel feature <b>aided</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm combining two-sensor modes: panchromatic video data and hyperspectral imagery. The hyperspectral data is used to provide a unique fingerprint for each target of interest where that fingerprint is the set of features used in our feature aided tracker. Results indicate an impressive 19 % gain in correct track ID with our hyperspectral feature aided tracker compared to the baseline performance with a kinematic-only tracker...|$|E

In ' order to guarantee continuity in the 33 -year solar irradiance climate data record, TSIS must be launched in time to overlap with current on-orbit solar irradiance instruments. Currently TSIS is moving towards a launch rcadin~ss date of January 2015. TSIS provides for continuation of the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) and the Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM),currently onboard NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) platform, launched in January 2003. The difficulty of ensuring continuity has increased due to the launch failure of NASA's Glory mission with its improved TIM. Achieving the needed overlap must now rely on extending SORCE. and maintaining the TSIS schedule. TSIS is one component of a NASA-NOAA joint program (JPSS) planned to transition certain climate observations to operational mode. We summarize issues of continuity, improvements being made to the TIM and 81 M sensors, and plans to provide for traceability of total and spectral irradiance measurements to ground-based cryogenic standards...|$|E

40|$|Feature <b>aided</b> <b>tracking</b> {{can often}} yield {{improved}} tracking performance over the standard multiple target tracking (MTT) algorithms with only kinematic measurements. However, in many applications, the feature signal of the targets consists of sparse Fourier-domain signals. It changes quickly and nonlinearly {{in the time}} domain, and the feature measurements are corrupted by missed detections and mis-associations. These two factors {{make it hard to}} extract the feature information to be used in MTT. In this paper, we develop a feature-aided nearest neighbour joint probabilistic data association filter (NN-JPDAF) for joint MTT and feature extraction in dense target environments. To estimate the rapidly varying feature signal from incomplete and corrupted measurements, we use the atomic norm constraint to formulate the sparsity of feature signal and use the ℓ_ 1 -norm to formulate the sparsity of the corruption induced by mis-associations. Based on the sparse representation, the feature signal are estimated by solving a semidefinite program (SDP) which is convex. We also provide an iterative method for solving this SDP via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where each iteration involves closed-form computation. With the estimated feature signal, re-filtering is performed to estimate the kinematic states of the targets, where the association makes use of both kinematic and feature information. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in a radar application...|$|E
40|$|NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) - LEO {{environmental}} satellites provide continuous {{coverage of}} Earth, supplying high-resolution global meteorological, oceanic and space observation data. In addition, these satellites {{are part of}} the international COSPAS – SARSAT program, which aides search and rescue teams worldwide. The USA segment, referred to as SARSAT (Search and Rescue Satellite <b>Aided</b> <b>Tracking)</b> system, is designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist on search and rescue operations. SARSAT locates distress beacons (406 MHz) activated at distress locations. The system calculates a location of the distress event using Doppler processing techniques. Processed data is continuously retransmitted through the SARSAT downlink to Local User Terminals (LUT) when satellites are in view. The downlink adjacent interference is expected when two satellites operate in close proximity and share the same frequency. The downlinks of all SARSAT LEO satellites use the same 1544. 5 MHz frequency. In cases where the satellites are within the main lobe of the local user terminal antenna, transmissions from adjacent satellites act as interference to one-another, effectively decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the desired downlink. This can result in missed distress beacon bursts or no stored solutions received at the LUT, consequently no data is provided about a distress location. Analysis on interference prediction, impacts on system operation and recommendations for mitigating interference periods where the duration may be significant, are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{summer of}} 1997 {{will not only}} be noted by NASA for the mission to Mars by the Pathfinder but also for the 179 {{brilliant}} apprentices that participated in the SHARP Program. Apprentice participation increased 17 % over last year's total of 153 participants. As indicated by the End-of-the-Program Evaluations, 96 % of the programs' participants rated the summer experience from very good to excellent. The SHARP Management Team began the year by meeting in Cocoa Beach, Florida for the annual SHARP Planning Conference. Participants strengthened their Education Division Computer <b>Aided</b> <b>Tracking</b> System (EDCATS) skills, toured the world-renowned Kennedy Space Center, and took a journey into space during the Alien Encounter Exercise. The participants returned to their Centers with the same goals and objectives in mind. The 1997 SHARP Program goals were: (1) Utilize NASA's mission, unique facilities and specialized workforce to provide exposure, education, and enrichment experiences to expand participants' career horizons and inspire excellence in formal education and lifelong learning. (2) Develop and implement innovative education reform initiatives which support NASA's Education Strategic Plan and national education goals. (3) Utilize established statistical indicators to measure the effectiveness of SHARP's program goals. (4) Explore new recruiting methods which target the student population for which SHARP was specifically designed. (5) Increase the number of participants in the program. All of the SHARP Coordinators reported that the goals and objectives for the overall program as well as their individual program goals were achieved. Some of the goals and objectives for the Centers were: (1) To increase the students' awareness of science, mathematics, engineering, and computer technology; (2) To provide students with the opportunity to broaden their career objectives; and (3) To expose students to a variety of enrichment activities. Most of the Center goals and objectives were consistent with the overall program goals. Modem Technology Systems, Inc., was able to meet the SHARP Apprentices, Coordinators and Mentors during their site visits to Stennis Space Center, Ames Research Center and Dryden Flight Research Center. All three Centers had very efficient programs and adhered to SHARP's general guidelines and procedures. MTSI was able to meet the apprentices from the other Centers via satellite in July during the SHARP Video-Teleconference(ViTS). The ViTS offered the apprentices and the NASA and SHARP Coordinators the opportunity to introduce themselves. The apprentices from each Center presented topical "Cutting Edge Projects".
