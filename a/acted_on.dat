5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are <b>acted</b> <b>on</b> by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} liability for environmental damages, which includes (i) public-law liability (in Czech legal framework described as "environmental injury") and (ii) private-law liability. The <b>Act</b> <b>on</b> Environmental Damage transposed the Directive on Environmental Liability (the "Directive"), the aim of which is prevention and remedy of environmental damage. The <b>Act</b> <b>on</b> Environmental Damage is legally binding from August 17, 2008, as lex specialis to the <b>Act</b> <b>on</b> Environment and other <b>Acts</b> <b>on</b> respective environmental components. Although the <b>Act</b> <b>on</b> Environmental Damage {{is based on the}} public-law approach, the private-law liability remains unaffected. According to the <b>Act</b> <b>on</b> Environmental Damage, the strict liability is imposed on operators of certain high-risk occupational activities and these operators are obliged to implement preventive and remedial measures and bear associated costs. Furthermore, the operators must provide relevant information on the request of competent public authorities...|$|R

This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W.
