40|$|Abstract − Elman Neural Network (ENN) {{have been}} {{efficient}} identification tool {{in many areas}} since they have dynamic memories. However, the local minima problem usually occurs {{in the process of}} the learning because of the employed back propagation algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method for ENN by introducing <b>adaptive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>parameter</b> into the traditional local search algorithm. The proposed learning network requires less memory and it is able to overcome the disadvantages of the gradient descent. Meanwhile it is also able to accelerates the speed of the convergence and avoid the local minima problem in a certain extent. We apply the new method to the Boolean Series Prediction Questions to demonstrate its validity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better ability to find the global minimum than back propagation algorithm within reasonable time...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} technique namely Backpropagation {{training with}} adaptive parameters using Lyapunov Stability Theory for training single hidden layer feed forward network is proposed. A three-layered Feedforward neural network architecture {{is used to}} solve the selected problems. Sequential Training Mode is used to train the network. Lyapunov stability theory is employed to ensure the faster and steady state error convergence and to construct and energy surface with a single global minimum point through the adaptive adjustment of the weights and the adaptive parameter ß. To avoid local minima entrapment, an adaptive backpropagation algorithm based on Lyapunov stability theory is used. Lyapunov stability theory gives the algorithm, the efficiency of attaining a single global minimum point. The learning parameters used in this algorithm {{is responsible for the}} faster error convergence. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>parameter</b> used in this algorithm is chosen properly for faster error convergence. The error obtained has been asymptotically converged to zero according to Lyapunov Stability theory.

40|$|Methods {{to speed}} up {{learning}} in back propagation and to optimize the network architecture have been recently studied. This paper shows how adaptation of the steepness of the sigmoids during learning treats these two topics in a common framework. The adaptation of the steepness of the sigmoids is obtained by gradient descent. The resulting learning dynamics can be simulated by a standard network with fixed sigmoids and a learning rule whose main component is a gradient descent with <b>adaptive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>parameters.</b> A law linking variation on the weights to variation on the steepness of the sigmoids is discovered. Optimization of units is obtained by introducing a tendency to decay to zero in the steepness values. This decay corresponds to a decay of {{the sensitivity of the}} units. Units with low final sensitivity can be removed after a given transformation of the biases of the network. A decreasing initial distribution of the steepness values is suggested to obtain a good compromise between s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|For on-line {{learning}} algorithms, which are applied in many vision {{tasks such as}} detection or tracking, robust integration of unlabeled samples is a crucial point. Various strategies such as self-training, semi-supervised learning and multiple-instance learning have been proposed. However, these methods are either too adaptive, which causes drifting, or biased by a prior, which hinders incorporation of new (orthogonal) information. Therefore, we propose a new {{on-line learning}} algorithm (TransientBoost), which is highly adaptive but still robust. This is realized by using an internal multi-class representation and modeling reliable and unreliable data in separate classes. Unreliable data is considered transient, hence we use highly <b>adaptive</b> <b>learning</b> <b>parameters</b> to adapt to fast changes in the scene while errors fade out fast. In contrast, the reliable data is preserved completely and not harmed by wrong updates. We demonstrate our algorithm on two different tasks, i. e., object detection and object tracking showing that we can handle typical problems considerable better than existing approaches. To demonstrate the stability and the robustness, we show long-term experiments for both tasks. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of {{computational}} neuroscience, we develop distributed models of the cortex to account for perceptual and sensorimotor capabilities. Adopting a mesoscopic level of modeling with dynamic neural fields representing topologically organized populations of cortical columns, we propose various learning rules, competition mechanisms and interconnection schemes. Under the right conditions, these allow the emergence of spatially coherent bumps of activity yielding attentional properties and high robustness to noise. We focus in this poster on the distributed, continuous and unsupervised learning of multi-sensory representations and sensorimotor behaviors. Learning should lead {{to the emergence of}} coherent bumps of activity in cortical maps when correlated stimuli are presented, with the possibility to recall potentially missing modalities. This raises the issues of the necessity and nature of generalization in a multimodal context. Research projects on this topic range from the introduction of constrained self-organization with associative maps, <b>adaptive</b> <b>learning</b> rule <b>parameters</b> for multimodal selectivity, to local contingencies in high dimensional sensorimotor spaces...|$|R

Research on <b>adaptive</b> <b>learning</b> usually focuses on gradient algorithms that employ problem–dependent heuristic <b>learning</b> <b>parameters.</b> This fact usually results in a trade–off between the convergence speed and the stability of the learning algorithm. The paper investigates gradient–based adaptive algorithms and discusses their limitations.
