40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bovine {{neonatal}} pancytopenia (BNP) is a hemorrhagic {{disease that}} emerged in calves across Europe in 2007. Its occurrence is attributed to immunization of the calf's mother with a vaccine produced using an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> line. Vaccine-induced alloantibodies specific for major-histocompatibility class I antigens are transferred from the mother to the calf via colostrum, leading to profound depletion of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells that is often fatal. Areas covered: Pubmed and Web of Science were used to search for literature relevant to BNP {{and the use of}} allogeneic vaccine cell lines. Following a review of the pathology and pathogenesis of this novel condition, we discuss potential risks {{associated with the use of}} allogeneic vaccine cell lines. Expert commentary: Although BNP is associated with a specific vaccine, it highlights safety concerns common to all vaccines produced using <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Measures to prevent similar vaccine-induced alloimmune-mediated adverse events in the future are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The use of autografts versus allografts for {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is controversial. The current popular options for ACL reconstruction are patellar tendon or hamstring autografts, yet advances in allograft technologies have made allogeneic grafts a favorable option for repair tissue. Despite this, the mismatched biomechanical properties and risk of osteoarthritis resulting from the current graft technologies have prompted the investigation of new tissue sources for ACL reconstruction. Previous work by our lab has demonstrated that tissue-engineered bone-ligament-bone (BLB) constructs generated from an <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> source develop structural and functional properties {{similar to those of}} native ACL and vascular and neural structures that exceed those of autologous patellar tendon grafts. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of our tissue-engineered ligament constructs fabricated from autologous versus <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> sources. Our preliminary results demonstrate that 6 months postimplantation, our tissue-engineered auto- and allogeneic BLB grafts show similar histological and mechanical outcomes indicating that the autologous grafts are a viable option for ACL reconstruction. These data indicate that our tissue-engineered autologous ligament graft could be used in clinical situations where immune rejection and disease transmission may preclude allograft use...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the possibility of evoking antigen-specific T cell immune response by using <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> {{as a source of}} adjuvant and also as a vehicle to deliver antigen. The mice were immunized with different preparations of antigen-pulsed allogeneic and syngeneic splenocytes. It was observed during the study that the animals immunized with antigen-pulsed mitomycin C treated <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> elicited antigen specific CD 4 + Th 1 cell response. Predominant release of IL- 2, interferon (IFN) -γ and IgG 2 a-isotype also occurred. In contrast, mice immunized with antigen-pulsed syngeneic cells chiefly enhanced the production of interleukin (IL) - 4 and IgG 1 -isotype. Further, allogeneic macrophages induced better T cell response than B cells or splenocytes and prominently induced the expression of B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2. Immunization with antigen-pulsed macrophages provided better recall responses compared to B cells. This was manifested by the high LFA- 1 α and low CD 45 RB expression on T cells. Because it is already known that mitomycin C-treated cells undergo apoptosis and dendritic cells engulf apoptotic cells, we therefore propose that generation of T cell response using antigen-pulsed <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> {{may be due to the}} engulfment of these cells by dendritic cells, which may then process and present antigen entrapped in <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> to activate naive CD 4 + T cells and differentiate them to Th 1 cells. This study therefore provides a rational basis for manipulating antigen-specific responses by immunizing with antigen-pulsed <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} antigens and <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> to induce {{lymphokine}} synthesis and cellular co-operation in lymphokine production was investigated.

The cells were then stimulated with PPD, SK-SD, candida and with <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells.</b> The presence of leucocyte inhibitory factor (LIF) in the culture supernatants was tested by the agarose migration method. The results indicated that T lymphocytes produced LIF after stimulation with antigens and <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, B cells responded to PPD.

Only autologous monocytes enhanced LIF synthesis after antigenic stimulation, whereas in mixed lymphocyte cultures allogeneic monocytes were as effective as autologous ones. The monocyte helper effect was mediated by soluble factors in mixed lymphocyte cultures and by soluble factors and direct cell [...] cell contact in antigen-stimulated cultures.

40|$|Osteoarthritis is a {{debilitating}} multi-factorial joint disease which currently has no cure. Due to the significant immune cell mediated component in this disease a therapy which can modulate this inflammation and promote cartilage healing is urgently required. An <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> therapy could be particularly beneficial in OA. One such <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> is the {{mesenchymal stem cell}} (MSC). MSC, {{in addition to their}} chondrogenic differentiation capacity, possess potent immunomodulatory capabilities in the undifferentiated state. The first part of this work focused on the immune properties of allogeneic MSC after differentiation to a chondrogenic lineage. The work found that after chondrogenic differentiation MSC upregulate immunogenic cell surface molecules such as MHCI, MHCII, CD 80 and CD 86 and are functionally more immunogenic in vitro. Additionally these cells were found to lose their ability to modulate allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation in in vitro co-culture assays, possibly due to the loss of PGE 2 and nitric oxide secretion. In vivo, it was shown that chondrogenically differentiated MSC, implanted subcutaneously, elicit significantly more infiltration of mononuclear phagocytes than their undifferentiated counterparts. Allogeneic differentiated MSC also resulted in higher memory T cell and allo-antibody responses compared to undifferentiated MSC, highlighting their immunogenicity. An alternative cell type for <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> therapy in OA is the chondrocyte itself. To test the immune properties of allogeneic chondrocytes, cartilage was excised and chondrocytes cultured from it in vitro. These cells were termed culture expanded primary chondrocytes (CEPC). In vitro CEPC were shown to be non-immunogenic, eliciting equivalent allogeneic T cell proliferation as undifferentiated MSC. This immunogenicity was not affected by culturing the cells in hypoxic conditions or exposing the cells to an inflammatory environment in vitro. Additionally CEPC could modulate both T cell and macrophage activity in vitro. This T cell immunomodulatory capacity was shown to be nitric oxide dependent. In summary, allogeneic chondrogenically differentiated MSC lose their immunomodulatory ability and become more immunogenic, while allogeneic CEPC are not immunogenic and have potent immunomodulatory activity in vitro...|$|E

This study was designed to show whether T cells activated by H- 2 <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells</b> in MLC or by syngeneic tumor cells in MLTC are also potential targets for these cytotoxic effectors. We found that thymocytes activated in vitro for 5 days by rIL- 2 were capable of killing tumor cells as well as activated T cells. Thymocytes activated by IL- 2 were accordingly utilized as a means of effecting clonal deletion of T cells activated by H- 2 <b>allogeneic</b> target <b>cells</b> in MLC. To establish whether the unresponsiveness is specific. IL- 2 -activated thymocytes were added as third party cells to MLC and MLTC. The results showed that both T cells, proliferating in response to H- 2 <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells,</b> and CTL, reactive against syngeneic tumors or H- 2 <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells,</b> are eliminated from the T cell pool. Only alloreactive T cells are specifically eliminated in MLC by IL- 2 -activated thymocytes, as the remaining T cells are capable of proliferating and generating CTL in response to antigenically unrelated third party <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cells.</b> The possibility that unresponsiveness might be due to soluble factors was ruled out by studies performed with a diffusable "chamber insert" culture system.

40|$|Viral {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality, and there are few therapeutic options available to augment a virusspecific T cell response. Although allo-HLA cross-reactivity from virus-specific memory T cells is common, it is unclear whether priming with specific allogeneic cells could conversely elicit a viral peptide/self-HLA restricted cytotoxic T cell response in humans. First, we used the previously described allo-HLA-B* 44 : 0 - cross-reactivity of EBV peptide/HLA-B 8 restricted T cells, to determine whether allogeneic HLA stimulation can elicit a cytolytic immune response against EBV. HLA-B 8 + HLA-B 44 - EBV-seropositive PBMCs were stimulated with either HLA-B* 44 : 02 + or HLA-B* 44 : 03 + mismatched irradiated PBMCs in a 7 - 10 d MLR. The allo-HLA stimulated responder cells were then evaluated for cytotoxicity using EBV peptide loaded autologous target cells and unloaded HLA-B 8 + EBV LCL target cells. PBMCs from EBV-seropositive donors gained EBV-specific cytolytic effector function following specific allo-HLA stimulation. Finally, we also elicited cytolytic CMV-specific responses using specific <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> stimulation, to confirm that this technique can be used to elicit viral peptide/self-HLA restricted responses even from nonpublic TCR responses. <b>Allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> stimulation used as a cell therapy may be a potential tool to augment an antiviral T cell response in patients with EBV or CMV infection...|$|E

In addition, sera from actively infected patients were examined with regard to suppressive capabilities toward normal lymphocyte blastogenesis by using the same assays. We found that patient mononuclear cells exhibited normal reactivity to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen when compared with controls. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients had a decreased stimulatory capacity in the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction, and P. vivax, but not P. falciparum, lymphocytes exhibited decreased responsiveness in the mixed leukocyte reaction. Furthermore, sera from patients with active malaria induced decreased responsiveness by normal mononuclear cells to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A, but not pokeweed mitogen; pooled P. falciparum sera caused decreased responsiveness to <b>allogeneic</b> <b>cell</b> surface antigens in the mixed leukocyte reaction.
