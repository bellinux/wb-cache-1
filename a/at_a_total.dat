The breadth of the molecular weight distribution decreased with increasing IB concentration in the feed, reaching Mw/Mn 1. 1. St homopolymeriza-tion was also living <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high <b>total</b> concentration, yielding polystyrene with Mn 82, 000 g/mol, the highest molecular weight ever achieved in carbocationic St poly-merization. An analysis of this system by both the traditional gravimetric–NMR copolymer composition method and FTIR demonstrated penultimate effects.
