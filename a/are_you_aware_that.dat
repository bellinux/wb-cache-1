25|$|<b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Claude Pepper {{is known}} all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, {{but this man}} is {{reliably}} reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, he has a brother who is a known homo sapiens, {{and he has a}} sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, habitually practiced celibacy.|$|E
2500|$|Hunt {{was also}} a proponent of {{artillery}} practices that reflected his conservative nature. Although acknowledging the power of massed batteries to repel infantry assaults (such as at Malvern Hill or against Pickett's Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg), he urged his gun crews to fire slowly and deliberately and reprimanded them if they exceeded an average of one shot per minute. He believed that faster rates impaired accurate targeting and depleted ammunition faster than could be replenished. A story often told about Hunt was when he exclaimed to a gunner of a fast-firing gun, [...] "Young man, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> every round you fire costs $2.67?" [...] Fast firing also implied {{to him that the}} gun crew was not brave enough to stand fast on the battlefield, wanting to get back behind the lines for resupply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Paste!" [...] he said, {{speaking}} with difficulty. [...] "Paste! Paste! Damn your impertinence, sir! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> that necklace cost forty thousand pounds?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 161. You spoke, {{and very}} justly, of the {{importance}} of fixing on works of art printed explanations; <b>are</b> <b>you</b> not <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> that has been done to some extent at the Kensington Museum?--Yes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Johnny, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> not <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> at {{your age}} every little boy is {{expected}} to say something brilliant in reply to my former question? How can you so dishonour your parents as to neglect this golden opportunity? Think again." ...|$|R
60|$|Chairman. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> a {{considerable}} number of the working classes are in bed on the Sunday?--Perhaps it is the best place for them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} I have hardly made myself understood,' said Agnes. 'I am not {{speaking}} to you out of any interest in Ferrari. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he is married?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Stockdale {{was made}} so uneasy by the circumstance, {{that as soon}} as the miller was gone, he said, 'Mrs. Newberry, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you were watched just now, and your {{conversation}} heard?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear boy, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> not <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{our first}} parents were content with fig-leaves, and <b>are</b> <b>you</b> not {{satisfied}} with a whole shirt? Besides, have you not a fine pair of legs and a handsome body; what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> ashamed of?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very ignorant indeed,--very ignorant indeed. And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware,</b> sir, <b>that</b> {{it would}} become a {{question}} with the Commissioners of this Board whether <b>you</b> could <b>be</b> retained {{in the service of}} this department if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> publicly punished by a police magistrate for such a disgraceful outrage as that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "English,--till {{we choose}} to repeal them. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> we have already freed {{ourselves}} from the stain of capital punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is a poor}} artist. I {{grant you}} that. His drawing is weak. But <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he is forty-three inches round the chest, six feet tall, and in perfect {{physical}} condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is to say, she {{has some}} prudence. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> I have {{proposed}} to make a considerable addition to her fortune--to hers, mind--on condition that she would postpone her marriage till next summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That you {{certainly}} are not," [...] exclaimed {{the body of}} Von Hartmann. [...] "You {{might very well be}} his father. But hullo, sir, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you are wearing my studs and my watch-chain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> similar {{prophylactic}} {{measures have}} been adopted, with more or less of success, {{in the case of}} other diseases?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{had better}} not stay long, sir; {{it must be}} near eleven o'clock. Oh, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware,</b> Mr. Rochester, <b>that</b> a {{stranger}} has arrived here since you left this morning?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{a similar}} system was resorted {{to in the}} {{exhibition}} of pictures there?--I should think in our exhibitions we must put anything where it would go, {{in the sort of}} way that we manage them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not one, Mr. Burns," [...] I said. [...] "There is no {{breath to}} spare on board this ship for that. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{there are times}} when I can't muster more than three hands to do anything?" ...|$|E
60|$|Captain. You are {{determined}} to proceed then in your own system? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> an unworthy motive may be assigned for this rapid succession of publication? You will be supposed to work merely for the lucre of gain.|$|E
6000|$|... "May I inquire," [...] he asked, {{after we}} had {{exchanged}} a few commonplaces, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Leslie Guest was an assumed name of the deceased?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{there is}} a poison which {{undermines}} the sources of life," [...] he remarked, [...] "it is alcohol. If {{there is a}} vice that degrades humanity, it is intoxication. Mr. Mountjoy, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> I am looking at you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rest!" [...] I repeated, when {{my medical}} adviser had done. [...] "My good friend, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> it is term-time? The courts are sitting. Look at the briefs {{waiting for me}} on that table! Rest means ruin in my case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us leave {{talking of}} the magisterium, Mr. Dousterswivel, and {{think a little}} about the magistrate. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> this {{occupation}} of yours is against the law of Scotland, and that both Sir Arthur and myself are in the commission of the peace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, if {{you receive}} any {{communication}} respecting this boy send it straight to me. I {{do not know}} whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I have been appointed his guardians?" ...|$|R
