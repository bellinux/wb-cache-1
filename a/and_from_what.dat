25|$|The body {{skeletons of}} even the {{earliest}} and most robustly built modern humans were less robust than those of Neanderthals (<b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> little we know from Denisovans), having essentially modern proportions. Particularly regarding the long bones of the limbs, the distal bones (the radius/ulna and tibia/fibula) are nearly the same size or slightly shorter than the proximal bones (the humerus and femur). In ancient people, particularly Neanderthals, the distal bones were shorter, usually thought to be an adaptation to cold climate. The same adaptation {{can be found in}} some modern people living in the polar regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it that we could not infer from Tibullus himself <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E

25|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. The system included three segments {{of what is}} now NY19, two of which were located south of Le Roy. The longest of the three pieces extended from modern NY305 in Belfast to NY5 in Le Roy and comprised most of Route16, which also continued southwest along current NY305 to Cuba. Two smaller segments, from the southeastern end of the overlap with current NY417 in Wellsville to County Route20 (CR20) in Belvidere <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> is now NY31 south of Brockport to West Avenue in the village, became part of Route4 and Route30, respectively. On March1, 1921, several routes were added, removed, or modified as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. The portion of Route30 between Medina and Rochester became part of an extended Route20 while Route16 was realigned to follow modern NY19A between Fillmore and Gainesville. Lastly, the portion of modern NY19 between NY417 and NY248 at Stannards was included in the new Route46.|$|E

500|$|The poem's seventy {{lines of}} blank verse are {{presented}} as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses' speech functions in this format; {{it is not necessarily}} clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> location. Some see the verse turning from a soliloquy to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph (33–43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a [...] "revised version [...] for public consumption": a [...] "savage race" [...] is revised to a [...] "rugged people".|$|E

500|$|While in the Senate, DeVeber {{chaired the}} Standing Committee on Public Health and Inspection of Foods. [...] One issue {{examined}} by this committee was water pollution: beginning in March 1909 and {{for nearly a}} year afterwards, it studied the question in view of the increasing mortality from typhoid fever, and concluded, {{in the words of the}} University of Michigan's Jennifer Read, [...] "that the country required some form of legislation to manage the problem. [...] However, it was at a loss about the form it should take <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> body it should emanate." [...] As chair of the committee, DeVeber attended an October 1910 federal-provincial conference in Ottawa called to attempt to coordinate all Canadian jurisdictions' responses to water pollution. [...] Besides recommending that provincial governments use their constitutional authority over health and municipal government to prevent undue water pollution from municipal sewage systems, it advised the federal government to use its authority over navigable waterways to prohibit the dumping of most waste into them; DeVeber supplied a draft bill for Parliament's consideration.|$|E
500|$|Czerniecki's {{goal was}} to present what he called [...] "Old Polish dishes" [...] as opposed to foreign recipes. He did, however, {{reference}} foreign influences throughout the book, particularly from French cuisine <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> he referred to as [...] "Imperial cuisine", that is, the cooking styles of Bohemia and Hungary, then both part of the Habsburg Empire. He displays an ambivalent attitude to French cookery; on the one hand, he dismisses French , or creamy soups, as alien to Polish culture and criticizes the use of wine in cooking. [...] "Every dish may be cooked without wine", he wrote, [...] "it suffices to season it with vinegar and sweetness." [...] On the other hand, Czerniecki does provide recipes for , dishes seasoned with wine, {{as well as other}} French culinary novelties, such as puff pastry (still known today in Poland as [...] "French dough"), arguing that a skilled chef must be able to accommodate foreign visitors with dishes from their own cuisines. In fact, the author included more French recipes than he was ready to admit; even the [...] "secret" [...] recipe for a capon in a bottle was adapted from a similar recipe found in [...]|$|E
500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I feel like we pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Professor Roy M. Anker {{argues that}} the film's {{thematic}} center is its direction to the audience to [...] "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission {{that this is the}} last day of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, [...] "from what place exactly, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> state of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." [...] Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside [...] "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a [...] "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in [...] "house beautiful" [...] domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a [...] "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden". The Burnhams are unaware that they are [...] "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" [...] who expect the [...] "rudiments of American beauty" [...] to give them happiness. Anker argues that [...] "they are helpless {{in the face of the}} prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation." ...|$|E
