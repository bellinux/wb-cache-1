5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

500|$|For his efforts, Gravel {{attracted}} some attention: famed writer Norman Mailer {{would say}} he [...] "provided considerable excitement" [...] and was [...] "good-looking enough to have played leads in B-films", while Rolling Stone correspondent Hunter S.

[...] Yet, the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the Democrats.

The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011.

500|$|Quatermass and the Pit {{continues}} to be generally well regarded among critics. John Baxter notes in Science Fiction in the Cinema that “Baker's unravelling of this crisp thriller is tough and interesting. [...] The film has moments of pure terror, perhaps the most effective that in which the drill operator, driven off the spaceship by the mysterious power within is {{caught up in a}} whirlwind that fills the excavation with a mass of flying papers.” John Brosnan, writing in The Primal Scream, found that, “As a condensed version of the serial, the film is fine but the old black-and-white version, though understandably creaky in places and with inferior effects, still works surprisingly well, having more time to build up a disturbing atmosphere. Bill Warren in Keep Watching the Skies! said, “The ambition of the storyline is contained in a well-constructed mystery that unfolds carefully and clearly”. Nigel Kneale had mixed feelings about the end result: he said, “I was very happy with Andrew Keir, who they eventually chose, and very happy with the film. There are, however, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> bother me... The special effects in Hammer films were always diabolical.” ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are among}} them <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not {{completely}} worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe {{that the people are}} right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears to me like the carvings in the Alhambra, those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we may not like it, is the true Spain.|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish {{broadcaster}} Gay Byrne, Fry {{was asked}} {{what he would say}} if he came face-to-face with God. Fry said: [...] "Bone cancer in children, what’s that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault? It’s utterly, utterly evil. [...] Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?" [...] Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: [...] "I said quite <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going {{all the way back to}} the Greeks." [...] Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.' In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.|$|E

30|$|We {{first state}} the {{assumptions}} necessary to our approach.

This assumption implies <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things,</b> including <b>that</b> network membership changes (such as node additions or hardware failures) are few and far between, and that load balancing is not used in the network. While the first assumption is certainly valid, the second assumption is a simplification that we hope to address in the near future.|$|R
