25|$|Parthenogenesis is {{distinct}} from artificial <b>animal</b> <b>cloning,</b> a process where the new organism is necessarily genetically identical to the cell donor. In cloning, the nucleus of a diploid cell from a donor organism is inserted into an enucleated egg cell and the cell is then stimulated to undergo continued mitosis, resulting in an organism that is genetically identical to the donor. Parthenogenesis is different, in that it originates from the genetic material contained within an egg cell and the new organism is not necessarily genetically identical to the parent.|$|E

2500|$|According to cloning {{specialist}} and physiologist George Seidel of Colorado State University, cloning {{a human being}} would not be difficult if many people donated their eggs or offered their wombs for implantation of clone embryos. [...] Lee Silver, a molecular biologist from Princeton University, noted the advantages that Raëlians had, as a pro-cloning religious group, in finding willing surrogates. [...] A biotechnology company called Advanced Cell Technology had cloned human embryo cells for medical purposes, and its CEO Michael D. West said that the directions for cloning a human being were available in published scientific literature. [...] Experts knowledgeable of the scientific advances in the field have noted that human reproductive chemistry is better understood than that of most animals. [...] For this reason, they thought that {{a higher rate of}} success was possible in human cloning compared with <b>animal</b> <b>cloning.</b> [...] Brigitte Boisselier anticipated that the work could begin on the preserved cells as soon as October, but {{there was no evidence that}} Clonaid had medical knowledge necessary for its success.
