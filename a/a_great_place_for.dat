40|$|National {{governments in}} the South, as well as {{international}} bodies such as the World Bank, are finally beginning to take {{the issues of the}} extent, causes and implications of disability seriously. There is, however, a danger that data on people with disabilities are not being collected in the most reliable manner, resulting in flawed policies and inefficient use of resources. In this policy brief we argue: 1. that the identification of disability must not be seen merely as a technical issue (does someone have or not have a particular impairment) but also as a political one (what claims are being made by or about someone if they define an impairment as worthy of public attention); 2. that in large scale surveys, questions concerning disability must move beyond primarily medical definitions and reconceptualise disability in a functional and interactionist perspective; 3. that there is <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> qualitative studies of the social meanings of disability to illuminate the effects of changes in policy and in wider society...|$|R
500|$|Minnie Island State Park is a pine grown-knoll that {{is located}} in the deepest portion of the lake. It is an unmarked and undeveloped island that also is Connecticut's {{smallest}} state park at 0.88 acres. The island acquired its name when a local man declared it to be Minnie Island, because he took his wife, Minnie, to it for picnics. Joseph Leary, author of A Shared Landscape writes, [...] "s far back as anyone can remember, the island was a frequent landing place for boating parties and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> local children to explore." [...] The island was claimed by both the towns of Salem, Connecticut and Montville, Connecticut though it was not in the land records of either town. This went unnoticed until a man attempted to purchase the island, and then made attempted to establish claim to the island. The man introduced a bill to authorize the sale by the state to establish title to the island, but instead the Connecticut General Assembly drafted and passed a bill to turn the island into a park.|$|E
500|$|Despite criticisms, most reviews were {{ultimately}} favourable to Empire: Total War. While IGN {{felt that the}} game [...] "drags a bit {{and there are some}} small, rough edges in the tactical battles", the game still [...] "deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the greatest names in gaming history". 1UP.com finished by saying [...] "For all its problems, it's undoubtedly progress", while Eurogamer felt that issues [...] "limit [...] to being merely one of the games of the year," [...] but implied that a post-release patch could deal with these flaws. GameSpot summarised that the game was [...] "complex and rewarding" [...] and GameSpy praised the game for [...] "the simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens [...] make this the most accessible Total War yet, and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> those unfamiliar with the series to get started". Crispy Gamer, while acclaiming the game [...] "spectacular" [...] and [...] "lovingly historical", criticised the documentation and concluded that the game falls apart due to its bad AI. The Game Informer reviewers criticised the AI, but still described the overall game experience as [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "outstanding". GamePro provided a dissenting opinion; although describing Empire: Total War as a game with a potential that [...] "with some extra tweaking, could have proven itself an excellent title", noted that it [...] "has a heap of problems that need resolving" [...] with bugs and crashes. PC Gamer UK enthusiastically proclaimed the game as [...] "one of the most playable, important and accomplished games ever created".|$|E

2500|$|While at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), Abbot {{would work}} under Samuel P. Langley. Langley {{would go on}} to change his focus from solar {{radiation}} to aeronautics, with Abbot taking over solar radiation research. Abbot would participate in many expeditions. In 1900 he, along with Langley, would travel to Wadesboro, North Carolina to observe a solar eclipse, followed by another eclipse expedition to Sumatra in 1901. During his expedition experiences he would also travel to Algeria, Egypt, South Africa, Australia, and other countries, often in partnership with the National Geographic Society. Abbot would become acting director of SAO in 1906 and in 1907, Abbot became the Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, following the death of Samuel P. Langley. While Langley was still Director, he had visited Mount Whitney, and decided it would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> an observatory. Abbot secured funding for the observatory and it was built in 1909. As Director, a position he would hold until his retirement, Abbot would open the Radiation Biology Laboratory in 1929, to study radiation effects on plants, and other organisms. [...] This helped to develop the first wave of biophysics researchers in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The years {{following}} the end of the First World War were <b>a</b> time of <b>great</b> change, not least in the field of healthcare. Rising costs and demand ensured that traditional philanthropic sources of income became increasingly insufficient. This necessitated the emergence of new patterns of funding in Britain’s voluntary hospitals with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> contributory schemes, direct patient payments and arrangements with the public sector. One aspect of such change was that the largely passive role, in which charitable provision had traditionally held the patient, was called into question. This article places this specific issue within context of the various ideological conceptions of healthcare, each defining the role of the patient in a different way. These are briefly outlined before the local case study of Bristol - and the Bristol Royal Infirmary (hereafter the Infirmary) in particular - is used to consider the impact that changes in voluntary hospital funding had on the role in which the patient was cast (here termed the ‘patient contract’). Although there were major changes in funding, most notably the introduction of a patient payment scheme in 1921, the patient contract remained in essence philanthropic. This {{was the result of a}} clear ideological commitment, most obviously on the part of the Faculty, to the treatment of the sick poor. ...|$|R
