40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial effect of different copaiba oil concentrations against the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, and analyze differences in inhibition of microorganisms with <b>autoclaved</b> and non <b>autoclaved</b> oil. This study provided an agar diffusion test with six isolates of bacteria and six different concentrations of <b>autoclaved</b> or non <b>autoclaved</b> copaiba oil and a negative control. The results showed sensitivity of five L. monocytogenes isolates related to the 10 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution of copaiba oil. Four strains also showed sensitivity to the 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution and one to 2. 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution. The 10 % non <b>autoclaved</b> oil solution showed growth inhibition only for two strains. These results had pointed the 10 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution of copaiba oil with higher inhibition as all other solutions and concentrations tested (P< 0. 05). For the other concentrations of both solutions, the 5 and 2. 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> and 10 % non <b>autoclaved</b> solutions had presented statistically equal. All other concentrations of both copaiba solutions and the negative control did not presented any bacteria inhibition. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the <b>autoclaved</b> copaiba oil may be a potential new agent source for infection control or for food preservation, inhibiting the growth of food-borne bacteria such as L. monocytogenes...|$|R

25|$|Membrane filters used in {{production}} processes are commonly made from {{materials such as}} mixed cellulose ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by <b>autoclaving</b> at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement.

25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by <b>autoclaving</b> at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E
50|$|In the {{production}} of composite aerospace and aircraft components, <b>autoclave</b> curing has traditionally been used to achieve the desired fiber content (resin-to-fiber ratio) {{and the absence of}} resin voids to produce light weight and strong components. <b>Autoclave</b> curing achieves this by placing the part under vacuum in an <b>autoclave</b> and then pressurizing the <b>autoclave</b> during the heated cure cycle. The high pressure on the part (within the pressurized <b>autoclave)</b> helps to minimize resin voids and to achieve the desired resin/fiber ratio.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} design {{optimization}} of brick-lined <b>autoclaves</b> to reduce wall thickness without compromising <b>autoclave</b> integrity. The use of acid resistant, brick lined, horizontal, <b>autoclaves</b> {{is common for}} hydrometallurgical processing within the mining industry. To prevent corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary, <b>autoclaves</b> are often lined with an acid proof flexible membrane and high nickel alloy overlay localized at nozzle areas.

Because of stringent out-of-roundness and deflection requirements, <b>autoclave</b> designers are faced with the challenge of choosing the proper thickness and layout of the <b>autoclaves.</b> Common practice for satisfying stringent requirements is to design much thicker <b>autoclave</b> than what is required to satisfy pressure and temperature conditions.

2500|$|Pure {{polystyrene}} is brittle, {{but hard}} enough that a fairly high-performance product {{can be made}} by giving it some of the properties of a stretchier material, such as polybutadiene rubber. The two such materials can never normally be mixed because of the small mixing entropy of polymers (see Flory-Huggins solution theory), but if polybutadiene is added during polymerisation it can become chemically bonded to the polystyrene, forming a graft copolymer, which helps to incorporate normal polybutadiene into the final mix, resulting in high-impact polystyrene or HIPS, often called [...] "high-impact plastic" [...] in advertisements. One commercial name for HIPS is Bextrene. Common applications of HIPS include toys and product casings.

40|$|Introduction: Dental turbine chamber is a {{suitable}} reservoir for living microorganisms, so chamber sterilization {{is necessary for}} reducing cross contamination risk. On the other hand, in non-vacuum <b>autoclaves,</b> steam penetration into turbine chamber is doubtful, while they are still in use in dental clinics. In this study, performance of small non-vacuum <b>autoclave</b> in turbine chamber sterilization was evaluated. Methods: A total of 48 dental turbines were sterilized by large vacuum <b>autoclaves.</b> The turbin chamber cap was opened in aseptic enviroment and a strip contaminated with bacillus stearothermophilus endospores was placed into chamber and chamber cap was closed. Twelve dental turbines were loaded in each of four <b>autoclaves</b> (2 large pre-vacuum <b>autoclaves,</b> 2 bench top non-vacuum <b>autoclaves)</b> and sterilization process preformed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the sterilization cycle, the strips were transferred to culture medium and incubated at 56 °C for 48 Hours.

Results: Being loaded in different <b>autoclaves,</b> All 48 turbines were sterilized properly and all the cultures were negative.
