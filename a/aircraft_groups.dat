25|$|The Korean and Vietnam Wars saw {{the size}} of Marine Aviation rebound from its post-WWII lows, {{emerging}} as the force that exists today, consisting of four air wings, 20 <b>aircraft</b> <b>groups</b> and 78 flying squadrons. By {{the end of the}} Vietnam War, the Marine Air-Ground Task Force had grown dependent on its multi-mission inventory of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, which could operate from land or sea bases to support Marines on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Korean War saw the Marine Corps {{rebound from}} its drastic cuts of about 75,000 {{at the start}} to a force, {{by the end of}} the {{conflict}} in 1953, of 261,000 Marines, most of whom were reservists. Aviation grew to four air wings, 20 <b>aircraft</b> <b>groups</b> and 78 flying squadrons, a level that has remained more or less consistent to this day. 4,267 Marines were killed and 23,744 wounded during the war, while 42 were awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

50|$|In 1934 part of {{the base}} was leased to the Marine Corps to use for {{maneuvers}} and gunnery ranges. At the beginning of World War II the Marines took over the northern portion of Camp Kearny, which they christened Marine Corps Air Depot Camp Kearny. In 1943 the Marines changed their station name to Marine Corps Air Depot Miramar to avoid confusion with the Navy base. The Marine base was mainly used to process Marine squadrons {{en route to the}} South Pacific. At various times it was the headquarters of Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 11, Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 12, Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 13, Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 14, Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 15 and Marine Air Warning Group 2 (MAWG-2) before they deployed to the Pacific.|$|R
25|$|Grumium arrived Pearl Harbor 30 June, and 10 July, {{continued}} to Roi Island. Arriving 19 July, the ship transferred supplies to <b>aircraft</b> <b>groups</b> until early September, {{then returned to}} Pearl Harbor. She sailed with another load of aviation supplies 28 September, calling at Ulithi and Eniwetok before arriving at Manus on 17 November. There she supplied carrier forces making the supporting strikes for the Philippine campaign, as America’s great island offensive gained momentum. Remaining at Manus until 5 December 1944, Grumium sailed to a closer advance base, Ulithi, arriving four days later. From Ulithi the ship supported the far reaching air raids on the Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa in the months to come.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War little thought had been given to the most {{efficient}} formations to use for military <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Groups</b> of fliers (drawn from the various nations Army or Navy) would fly in columns, or line ahead, as if they were troops of cavalry or flotillas of ships. This was soon found to be inefficient, for several reasons. First, the leaders were unable to communicate with their squadrons, and they with him, other than the vague instruction to follow the leader. Second, if they came under anti-aircraft fire from the ground, the flight would either all turn at once, scattering the formation, or they would follow the leader round a point, as horsemen or ships, maintaining cohesion but being exposed to fire on a fixed point.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{level in}} Marine {{aviation}} is the Marine Aircraft Wing, {{the equivalent of}} a division. Wings are usually grouped with a Marine division and a Marine Logistics Group to form a Marine Expeditionary Force. Administratively, Marine aviation is organized into three active duty MAWs and one reserve MAW. MAWs are designed to provide units in support of MAGTF or other operations. Each MAW has a unique organizational structure. The MAW may be reinforced with assets from other MAWs to provide the necessary assets to meet mission requirements. The MAW contains a Marine Aircraft Wing Headquarters (MAW HQ), that directs and coordinates the operations of the MAW, a Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron (MWHS) (see: MWHS-1, MWHS-2 and MWHS-3), which provides administrative and supply support for the MAW HQ, three or four Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Groups</b> (MAGs), and a Marine Air Control Group (MACG). The mission of the MAW is to conduct air operations in support of the Marine Forces to include offensive air support, anti-aircraft warfare, assault support, aerial reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and the control of aircraft and missiles. As a collateral function, the MAW may participate as an integral component of naval aviation in the execution of such other Navy functions as the Fleet Commander may direct.|$|E

50|$|Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 26 was {{activated}} on 16 June 1952 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and {{was assigned}} to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. The first operational Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> arrived from MCAS Cherry Point in July 1954. Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 26, a group of helicopters originally commissioned in 1952, filled the needs of the Marine Corps to maintain a force which was expeditionary and amphibious in nature. In July 1954, the group relocated to Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. On 1 March 1959, it was designated Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 26.|$|R
50|$|The Super Cobra was {{operated}} by Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 39, based at Camp Pendleton. Personnel aboard the aircraft belonged to Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 39 and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, based at Miramar.|$|R
2500|$|Fifty-five Spechts were produced. [...] These {{were used}} by gliding clubs for pilot {{training}} {{in place of the}} earlier, open, single-seat primary gliders like the Zögling and its descendants. [...] A few remained on the European civil aircraft registers in 2010. In 2009 at least two of these were flight worthy, each with historic <b>aircraft</b> <b>groups</b> in Denmark and Norway; in Sweden a third Specht, with a certificate of airworthiness valid into 2015, is owned by a similar group.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1944, as a {{lieutenant}} colonel, he departed for the Pacific area. He served as Operations Officer of Marine Aircraft Group 24 at Bougainville, and at Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippine Islands. Additionally, he saw duty as Operations Officer of Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Groups,</b> Dagupan on Luzon and, later, Zamboanga, on Mindanao. During the period [...] from November 1, 1944 to May 26, 1945, he earned the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit with Combat [...] "V", the Distinguished Flying Cross, and six Air Medals in the Solomons, New Guinea, and Philippine Islands area.|$|E
2500|$|As the Marine Corps grew to {{its maximum}} size, Marine {{aviation}} also peaked at 5 air wings, 31 <b>aircraft</b> <b>groups</b> and 145 flying squadrons. The Battle of Guadalcanal would teach several lessons, {{such as the}} debilitating effects of not having air superiority, the vulnerability of unescorted targets (such as transport shipping), and the vital importance of quickly acquiring expeditionary airfields during amphibious operations. After being dissatisfied with Navy air support at the Battle of Tarawa, General Holland Smith recommended that Marines should do the job, put into effect at New Georgia. The Bougainville and 2nd Philippines campaigns saw the establishment of air liaison parties to coordinate air support with the Marines fighting on the ground, and the Battle of Okinawa brought most of it together {{with the establishment of}} aviation command and control in the form of Landing Force Air Support Control Units ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 1969, the {{squadron}} redeployed to Okinawa {{where it was}} reassigned to Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 15 of the 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade. In December 1969, {{the squadron}} again became part of Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 36.|$|R

It was assigned during August 1942 to Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 12, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing before being reassigned during September 1942 to Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 11. The squadron was deployed from October to November 1942 to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, and reassigned to Marine <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Group</b> 11. During {{the next ten}} months they flew in support of operations on Guadalcanal and did not lose one pilot in combat over that time. The squadron was equipped with the Douglas SBD Dauntless.|$|R

2500|$|World War II {{would see}} the Marine Corps' air arm expand rapidly and extensively. They would reach their peak number of units with 5 air wings, 31 <b>aircraft</b> <b>groups</b> and 145 flying squadrons. During the war, {{and for the next}} fifty years, the Guadalcanal Campaign would become a {{defining}} point for Marine Aviation. The great takeaways were the debilitating effects of not having air superiority, the vulnerability of targets such as transport shipping and the vital importance of quickly acquiring expeditionary airfields during amphibious operations. Because of the way the Pacific War unfolded, Marine Aviation was not able to achieve its 1939 mission of supporting the Fleet Marine Force at first. For {{the first two years of}} the war, the air arm spent most of its time protecting the fleet and land-based installations from attacks by enemy ships and aircraft. This began to change after the Battle of Tarawa as the air support for ground troops flown by Navy pilots left much to be desired. After the battle, General Holland Smith recommended, [...] "Marine aviators, thoroughly schooled in the principles of direct air support," [...] should do the job. The New Georgia Campaign saw the first real close air support provided to Marine ground forces by Marine Air, the Bougainville Campaign and the campaign to retake the Philippines saw the establishment of air liaison parties to coordinate air support with the Marines fighting on the ground, and the Battle of Okinawa brought most of it together with the establishment of aviation command and control in the form of Landing Force Air Support Control Units. During the course of the war, Marine Aviators were credited with shooting down 2,355 Japanese aircraft while losing 573 of their own aircraft in combat, they had 120 aces and earned 11 Medals of Honor. Immediately following the war, the strength of the Marine Corps flying arm was drastically cut as part of the post war drawdown of forces. Their active strength fell from 116,628 personnel and 103 squadrons on 31 August 1945 to 14,163 personnel and 21 squadrons on 30 June 1948. They also maintained another 30 squadrons in the Marine Air Reserve. Also during this time, the Secretary of Defense for then President Harry S. Truman, Louis A. Johnson, attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation by transferring its air assets to other services, and even proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces.|$|E
