500|$|In New Mexico, they {{obtained}} false identification, {{and purchased}} several pistols. Their {{intention was to}} purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said {{it was easy to}} obtain guns in New Mexico: [...] "we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was show some identification and it was easy to get." [...] Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity [...] "of someone dying very young", next went [...] "to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate" [...] and described how [...] "we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt". [...] "And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets," [...] said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt [...]38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger [...]357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors.|$|E
2500|$|SST {{issued the}} Minutemen's debut EP Paranoid Time as its second release in 1980. The songs were {{recorded}} and mixed {{in a single}} night for $300. Minutemen bassist Mike Watt recalled, [...] "It {{was at that point}} we realized <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was pay for the pressings, that records weren't a gift from Mount Olympus [...] [...] [...] Maybe it was from Greg's experience with ham radios, but he believed if you try, you can get things beyond your little group." [...] Facing hostility towards hardcore punk, SST groups like Black Flag and the Minutemen played wherever they could, mainly at house parties and in basements early on. Black Flag began traveling up the California coast to play Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, making seven trips in total. SST house record producer Spot went along as sound-man and tour manager, a job he would perform for several years, along with helping to record much of the label's music.|$|E

A little to leeward of this was a small cluster of islands, where we were going to refit, abounding with delicious fruits, and peopled by a race almost wholly unsophisticated by intercourse with strangers.|$|E

Just hit him on the nose every time he rushed, and when he got artful and rushed with his head down, why, the thing to do was to stick out your leg. When he grabbed at the leg you drew it back and hit hint on the nose again. That was all.|$|E

[...] So he untied the cow, and drew her up close to the tree, and got a hitch about it right enough.

The fact that she did not know where he was, any more than Mrs. March herself, {{had nothing to do with}} the result; that was a mere detail, which would settle itself. She clinched her argument by confessing that her own engagement had been broken off, and that it had simply renewed itself. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to keep willing it, and waiting. There was something very mysterious in it.|$|E

6000|$|Inside {{the office}} {{he would see}} a man with {{whiskers}} buying a ticket for New York. The simplicity of the process fascinated him. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to walk in, bend over the counter while the clerk behind it made dabs with a pencil at the illustrated plate of the ship's interior organs, and hand over your money. A child could do it, if in funds. At this thought his hand strayed to his trouser-pocket. A musical crackling of bank-notes proceeded from the depths. His quarterly allowance had been paid to him only a short while before, and, though a willing spender, he still retained a goodly portion of it. He rustled the notes again. There was enough in that pocket to buy three tickets to New York. Should he? [...] . Or, on the other hand--always look {{on both sides of}} the question--should he not? ...|$|E

At your trial Never stood up a bolder man than you; You would not cap the Pope's commissioner-- Your learning, and your stoutness, and your heresy, Dumbfounded half of us. So, after that, We had to dis-archbishop and unlord, And make you simple Cranmer once again. The common barber dipt your hair, and I Scraped from your finger-points the holy oil; And worse than <b>all,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> kneel to me; Which was not pleasant for you, Master Cranmer. Now you, that would not recognise the Pope, And you, that would not own the Real Presence, Have found a real presence in the stake, Which frights you back into the ancient faith: And so you have recanted to the Pope. How are the mighty fallen, Master Cranmer! ...|$|E
60|$|Their technic {{consisted}} in {{waving their}} tails and moving {{their heads in}} a regular succession of measured movements resulting in a cadence which evidently pleased {{the eye of the}} Mahar as the cadence of our own instrumental music pleases our ears. Sometimes the band took measured steps in unison to one side or the other, or backward and again forward--it all seemed very silly and meaningless to me, {{but at the end of}} the first piece the Mahars upon the rocks showed the first indications of enthusiasm that I had seen displayed by the dominant race of Pellucidar. They beat their great wings up and down, and smote their rocky perches with their mighty tails until the ground shook. Then the band started another piece, and all was again as silent as the grave. That was one great beauty about Mahar music--if you didn't happen to like a piece that was being played <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was shut your eyes.|$|E

He had been through so much that he was just as subdued as Michael and just as taciturn. He bored most people, who could not understand him. Of course, the truth was the other way around. They bored him. They knew so little of life that he knew the last word of. And one could scarcely get any word out of him. It was not that he had forgotten how to speak, but that he could not see any reason for speaking when nobody could understand. He was really crusty from too-bitter wise experience. But <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was look at him in his tremendous repose and know that he had been through the thousand hells, including all the frozen ones. His eyes had the same quietness of Michael's. And they had the same wisdom. I'd give almost anything to know how he got his shoulder scarred. It must have been a tiger or a lion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{the passion}} is passed; when the glory and {{the wonder of}} Desire- -Nature's eternal ritual of marriage, solemnising, sanctifying it to her commands--is ended; when, sooner or later, some grey dawn finds you {{wandering}} bewildered in once familiar places, seeking vainly the lost palace of youth's dreams; when Love's frenzy is faded, like the fragrance of the blossom, like the splendour of the dawn; there will remain to you, just what was there before--no more, no less. If passion was <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give to one another, God help you. You have had your hour of madness. It is finished. If greed of praise and worship was your price--well, you have had your payment. The bargain is complete. If mere hope to be made happy was your lure, one pities you. We do not make each other happy. Happiness is {{the gift of the}} gods, not of man. The secret lies within you, not without. What remains to you will depend not upon what you THOUGHT, but upon what you ARE. If behind the lover there was the man--behind the impossible goddess of his love-sick brain some honest, human woman, then life lies not behind you, but before you.|$|E

[...] That I felt convinced that nothing would induce you to encourage, [...] or to even listen to, any attempt which others might make to [...] disturb the existing state of things as to the leadership, unless [...] the wish was very clearly expressed to you by Hartington and [...] himself, and you would demand full proof that their interests and [...] that of the party strongly pointed to the reconsideration of your [...] own position.
