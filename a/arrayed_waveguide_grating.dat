5000|$|Beginning in the mid-1980s, Henry (with R. F. Kazarinov) {{initiated}} a new photonic integrated circuit technology based on silica waveguides fabricated on silicon wafers. <b>Arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> routers, invented by C. Dragone, were fabricated with this technology {{and used for}} wavelength-division multiplexing, the simultaneous transmission of optical signals at different wavelengths over a single optical fiber. Henry returned to the physics of quantum noise in 1996. With Kazarinov, he published [...] "Quantum Noise in Photonics" [...] (Rev. Mod. Phys. 68, 801-853 1996), which explained the physical nature of noise in optical communications. The basic equations governing noise phenomena were derived from first principles and applied to specific examples.|$|E
5000|$|In reality, {{assembling}} {{a whole bunch}} (possibly {{on the order of}} [...] ) of beam splitters and phase shifters in an optical experimental table is challenging and unrealistic. To make LOQC functional, useful and compact, one solution is to miniaturize all linear optical elements, photon sources and photon detectors, and to integrate them onto a chip. If using a semiconductor platform, single photon sources and photon detectors can be easily integrated. To separate modes, there have been integrated <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> (AWG) which are commonly used as optical (de)multiplexers in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM). In principle, beam splitters and other linear optical elements can also be miniaturized or replaced by equivalent nanophotonics elements. Some progress in these endeavors {{can be found in the}} literature, for example, Refs. In 2013, the first integrated photonic circuit for quantum information processing has been demonstrated using photonic crystal waveguide to realize the interaction between guided field and atoms.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sloshing}} impact induced strain exerted on {{the insulation}} panel of a {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) tank was measured in situ by using a fiber-optic Bragg reflector and a wavelength interrogator. To prevent the catastrophic failure of the LNG vessel caused by sloshing impact on the insulation panel, continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis of the induced strain are required. In this study, two different fiber-optic systems are developed based on (1) edge filter type and (2) <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> type. Bragg reflection sensors were embedded inside the reinforced polyurethane foam insulating panel, which was used to cover the inner surface of the LNG tank. Initially, an edge filter type fiber-optic system is attempted for measuring strain for high speed applications. Another type of fiber-optic system, <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating,</b> is developed. By incorporating an <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> device for the interrogation of the reflected wavelength from the Bragg reflector, a dynamic strain of 4000 me occurring within a duration of 10 ms {{was able to be}} measured in real time. The accuracy of the measured data was confirmed by comparing it to the data obtained by means of a high speed camera.

40|$|Abstract—We {{fabricated}} and packaged a {{very compact}} 4 x 4 wavelength router in Silicon-on-insulator. This device is {{for use in}} a 10 gigabit/s opti-cal backplane interconnect based on tuneable lasers and wavelength rout-ing. Fabrication was done using CMOS compatible processes, enabling vol-ume fabrication. The router consists of a very compact <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> using submicron waveguides and bend radii of just 3 µm. This is achieved by exploiting the very high refractive index contrast. By applying a double etch scheme, the insertion loss of the <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> has been reduced to 3. 5 dB for the best routing path. Vertical fibre couplers are used to interface to an standard eight-fibre array connector. The result-ing total fibre-to-fibre insertion loss of the router is 12. 5 dB. The crosstalk level is still- 12 to- 14 dB, which is within spec for the envisaged application. Keywords—Nanophotonics, <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> I...|$|E
