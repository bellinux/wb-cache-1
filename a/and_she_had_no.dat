5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this spot as well. In 1875, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial {{as well as his}} exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} on 7 October that Scallon had dual US and Irish citizenship, but she denied hiding {{this from the}} public, saying that her US citizenship, which involved her taking an oath renouncing allegiance to Ireland, {{was not an issue}} then or now <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> reason to hide it.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{discovered}} that on July 6, 1953, she collapsed on a sidewalk in the Spanish Harlem section of Manhattan, and later died of pneumonia {{at a hospital}} in Harlem at the age of 39. Since no one claimed her body <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> identification on her, the city gave her a pauper's burial on Hart Island, the city's only potter's field.|$|E

25|$|In 1792, her spouse became regent {{during the}} {{minority}} of his nephew Gustav IV Adolf. The actual power {{was in the}} hands of his favorite, Count Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> influence upon the regency. In 1798–99, the spouses made a trip to Germany and Austria and visited Carlsbad, Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg. In 1800, the ducal couple founded an amateur court theater, Damatiska akademien, at court, but it was closed by the monarch.|$|E
25|$|Surviving letters {{indicate}} {{the marriage was}} stable <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> intention of ever returning to the United States. The middle-aged couple discussed retiring in either South Africa or Australia. Meanwhile, they moved about constantly in the Bay of Bengal area in the Indian Ocean, staying in Ceylon, India, Burma, Straits Settlements, and Java. In 1940, {{at the age of}} 45, Gibson was stricken by a bladder infection, medical treatment for which was not available in the region. With Europe overwhelmed by war and passage to South Africa and Australia threatened by German naval operations, she reluctantly returned without her spouse to Los Angeles and underwent surgery twice at Hollywood Hospital. Her husband Elbert Lewis died when the Japanese bombed Socony-Vacuum's oil facility at Penang, Straits Settlements (now Malaysia) on March 15, 1942.|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} tried inserting an intravenous {{needle into}} Selena, but her veins had collapsed {{because of the}} massive blood loss and low (or no) blood pressure, making the insertion extremely difficult. Local police closed off Navigation Boulevard. When paramedics delivered Selena to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at 12:00p.m. (CST), her pupils were fixed and dilated, {{there was no evidence}} of neurological function, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> vital signs. Doctors were able to establish an [...] "erratic heartbeat" [...] long enough to transfer her to the trauma room. Doctors began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena's chest and finding massive internal bleeding. Selena's right lung was damaged, her collarbone was shattered, and her veins were emptied of blood. Doctors widened her chest opening, administered drugs into her heart, and applied pressure to her wounds. Dr. Louis Elkins said a [...] "pencil-size artery leading from the heart had been cut in two by the hollow-point bullet" [...] and that six units of blood from the transfusion had spilled out from her circulatory system. After 50 minutes the doctors realized the damage was irreparable. Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was pronounced dead at 1:05p.m. (CST) from blood loss and cardiac arrest.|$|E

500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea who they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who tell you that they are your family. But you feel nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{young woman}} was {{initially}} believed to be between 20 and 23 years old and was [...] tall, weighing 112 pounds. The woman had green eyes, tinted dark brown hair, and had vaccination scars on both her left arm and left thigh. A one-quarter-inch horizontal scar was also visible beneath her left breast, and a birthmark was located upon her right buttock. She had also received several silver amalgam fillings in both her upper and lower jaw. Besides these traits, the victim had no other distinctive features, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> identification on her possession {{at the time of}} her discovery.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Psylocke {{could also}} use her telepathy {{to project a}} focused beam of {{directed}} psionic energy called a [...] "psycho-blast" [...] that could incapacitate or kill a living being instantly. This attack was powerful enough to pierce the Juggernaut's psi-proof helmet. The psycho-blast was able to affect inorganic material as well as living targets (when directing a psycho-blast at Sabretooth the energy destroyed the metal Cerebro helmet she was wearing). Psylocke also possessed limited precognitive powers that occasionally allowed her to envision probable future events, or to see quick flashes of the immediate future. These visions were random and infrequent, however, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> control over them.|$|E
2500|$|Terry and {{her husband}} lived in {{considerable}} style in Moray Lodge in Kensington, London, where he hosted the Moray Minstrels, until Lewis lost all his money. After that, in Gielgud's words, [...] "my grandmother lived very simply and rather resentfully in an ugly little house in West Cromwell Road, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> grand clothes and did not give parties any more. She played bridge and had paying guests. This was a sad ending to her career but she never grumbled or groused. She must have hated being out of the picture, even though many people still recognized her and paid court to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a former}} police officer who {{is known as the}} allegory detective because he investigates allegories—urban legends that {{manifest}} physically and possess people who believe in them. Daisuke himself is possessed by two. The first is the belief that he will die if he hiccups more than 100 times in a row. When an allegory is closer, Daisuke hiccups, so it is his way to detect an allegory but in every case he runs the risk of dying of the hiccups. The second is , a girl who in the legend haunts girls' school restrooms but now helps Daisuke to run his agency. She provides technological support by creating the [...] "anti-allegory program" [...] that can [...] "de-visualize" [...] the allegories, revealing their real form to its believers. Daisuke and Hanako are also accompanied by the human girl , who works with them since they helped to solve her allegory problem <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> money to pay for it.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, {{after nearly}} thirty {{years out of}} the business, Stuart {{decided to return to}} acting. She got an agent who {{obtained}} her bit parts, mostly in television— including guest appearances on series such as The Waltons and Murder, She Wrote. Her friend, director Nancy Malone, gave her a leading role in Merlene of the Movies, a quirky film for television, and other friends gave her parts in their shows. In 1982 came My Favorite Year. Although Stuart's scene lasted moments <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> lines, she was dancing with Peter O'Toole. She wrote, [...] "It was a great privilege to work with him." [...] After that, Stuart was in Jack Lemmon's drama Mass Appeal and Goldie Hawn's comedy Wildcats, then more bits and pieces in television. A vintage publicity photo of her was also used for the image of 'Peg', the sister of butler Alfred Pennyworth, in the 1997 film Batman & Robin.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{previously}} been {{the mistress of}} Charles Hart and Charles Sackville, Gwyn jokingly called the King [...] "her Charles the Third". By the summer of 1668, Gwyn's affair with the King was well-known, though there was little reason to believe it would last for long. She continued to act at the King's House, her new notoriety drawing larger crowds and encouraging the playwrights to craft more roles specifically for her. June 1668 found her in Dryden's An Evening's Love, or The Mock Astrologer, and in July she played in Lacy's The Old Troop, a farce about a company of Cavalier soldiers during the English Civil War, based on Lacy's own experiences. Possibly, Nell Gwyn's father {{had served in the}} same company, and Gwyn's part — the company whore — was based on her own mother. As her commitment to the King increased, though, her acting career slowed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> recorded parts between January and June 1669, when she played Valeria in Dryden's very successful tragedy Tyrannick Love.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body was}} {{clad in a}} red short-sleeved shirt. A peasant-style skirt was found lying {{on top of the}} victim's legs. No {{undergarments}} were found. [...] Despite this, no conclusive evidence of sexual assault was found, but this was difficult to determine because of the exposure of the body. A golden cross necklace was found tangled in the victim's hair. Two earrings were found in her left ear. Red nail polish was found on the right hand only <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> known surgical scars, distinct birth marks or tattoos. Scars or marks on the head/face area would not be known due to the condition of the body. The front two teeth were slightly darker than the other teeth. The victim's appendix and tonsils were intact. Forensic anthropologists determined that the victim was not pregnant and had never given birth, and was most likely between the ages of 14 and 18 {{years old at the time}} of death. Toxicology did not reveal any traces of drugs but was not entirely conclusive because of the time lapse between the death and discovery of the body. It is believed that the body was discovered after 2 to 3 days or possibly weeks of exposure. This was difficult to determine because of the hot and humid weather in the area at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
