25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any internal <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|E

Any other form of punishment would probably be executed as well, if direct punishment possibly even right on the spot. If any fines or premiums awarded were not paid, it again is quite likely that the successful claimant then gained the right to distrain the convicted party and thereby recover a value equivalent to the unpaid fines or premiums.|$|E

5000|$|Despite these future {{setbacks}} {{the numbers}} of asylum seekers started to fall. This was brought about by many factors, the better casework processes, faster removal rates, new appeal regulations and other {{factors such as the}} 33,000 people who were denied boarding in 2003 by Airline Liaison Officers abroad. During the 1990s the Airline Liaison Officers had been an essential component in preventing undocumented passengers reaching the UK and driving down asylum claims, (see previous sections). The impact was significant - numbers of Inadequately Documented Arrivals (IDAs) detected after arriving by air fell from 14,071 in 2003 to 6,831 in 2005.

[...] In June 2001, then again in June 2002, against {{the advice of}} her lawyers, Pike asked the courts to drop her appeal and sought to be executed via electrocution. Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz granted the request and an execution date of August 19, 2002, was set. Pike soon thereafter changed her mind and on July 8, 2002, defense lawyers filed a motion to allow the appeal process to continue. This motion was denied. However, on August 2, 2002 a three judge state appeals court panel ruled that the proceedings should be continued and the execution was not carried out. In December 2008, Pike's latest request for a new trial was turned down and she was returned to death row. This denied request {{is believed to be the}} final allowed under the <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> in the State of Tennessee. [...] As of May 2014, no execution date has been set and her case has now entered the federal court system.

40|$|Excerpt] The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) is the {{new teacher}} {{evaluation}} system adopted by New York State in 2012. Through APPR, each New York State teacher’s performance is evaluated annually. If a teacher is rated Ineffective, {{he or she must}} take part in a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP). If a teacher is rated Ineffective for two consecutive years, the teacher may be dismissed even if that teacher has tenure. Given these potential consequences, the ability to appeal APPR ratings and how those ratings are conducted has been a major issue for teachers and their unions. Under New York Education Law 3012 -c, which establishes APPR, each school district negotiates its own APPR procedure with its local teachers union, including any procedures for appealing the performance review. This report examines the APPR <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> established by school districts in order to investigate the following: Which aspects of the APPR process can teachers appeal? Who has the fi nal say in that appeals process? How much time do appeals processes take? Can teachers appeal APPR issues through the regular contractual grievance-arbitration procedure? This report addresses these questions by analyzing APPR appeal procedures for all New York State school districts. The data analyzed was gathered by coding the provisions of the APPR appeal procedures, which are publicly available on the New York State Department of Education website (1) ...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} between 8, 000 - 10, 000 asylum seekers {{living in the}} Australian community awaiting decisions {{at different stages of}} their applications for protection visas and <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures.</b> Many of these asylum seekers are BVE holders and as such are denied work-rights, income support, and access to Medicare services. Some 750 - 900 such asylum seekers are estimated to be living in Victoria. This group includes children, elderly persons and single parents without any form of independent income. Many of these asylum seekers are living in conditions of abject poverty. Some have been released from detention on the basis of special needs relating to mental and physical health; many have special needs {{as a result of the}} experience of torture and trauma. There is currently no Government provision made to assist with these needs, to provide general or specialist health care, to facilitate a dignified transition into the Australian community, or to encourage a degree of self-reliance. As a result of their visa conditions, BVE holders are dependent upon charity organisations and face ongoing and spiralling difficulties with homelessness, cumulative debt, family breakdown and the exacerbation of existing health problems. This situation persists despite Australia’s obligations under international law. Conventions and recommendations to which Australia is a party oblige it to provide basic living necessities and adequate health care to asylum seekers living in its territory and recommend that the provision of work-rights is in the best interests of both asylum-seekers and host states. These conventions oblige Australia to provide adequate care for children asylum seekers in particular. Currently, under the BVE regime, these obligations are not being met...|$|E
