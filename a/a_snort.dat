500|$|In 1993, Pitt {{reunited with}} Juliette Lewis {{for the road}} film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's {{character}} in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as [...] "outstanding, all boyish charm and then <b>a</b> <b>snort</b> that exudes pure menace." [...] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film. He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Sounds made by {{domestic}} sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts. [...] Bleating ("baaing") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, {{but also at}} times between other flock members. [...] The bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations. [...] Vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition. [...] A variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances. Apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain. [...] Isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep. [...] Pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor. [...] Rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting; [...] somewhat similar rumbling sounds may {{be made by the}} ewe, especially when with her neonate lambs. [...] <b>A</b> <b>snort</b> (explosive exhalation through the nostrils) may signal aggression or a warning, and is often elicited from startled sheep.|$|E

Joe Lake began picking over stacks of goat-skins and bags of wool that were piled against the hogan.|$|R

5000|$|A {{posterior}} nasal fricative {{is a type}} of velopharyngeal fricative {{in which}} the soft palate approaches the pharyngeal wall without closing off the velopharyngeal port, allowing frication through the nasal passages.

The sound is used as a substitute for sibilants (...) , which cannot be produced with a cleft palate.|$|R
