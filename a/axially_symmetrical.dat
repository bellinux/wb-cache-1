40|$|The paper {{includes}} {{a description of}} finds recovered in the village Strawczyn, near Kielce. Conservatory and archaeological works conducted there in 1990 resulted in uncovering of hardly preserved relics of a masonry building raised from local lime stone. Portable relics found in cultural layers inside the building and nearby allowed to date the object to about 1600 till the mid 17 th century. Poorly preserved relics of foundation walls enabled to reconstruct the projection {{of the building and}} its interior division. It was a two tract and in the utmost axles three tract house built on a plan of an elongated rectangular (19 by 33 m) clung in the corners by octahedral towers. In the northern tract, on both sides of a big room situated axially there were two smaller rooms, whereas in the southern tract there were five bigger and two small rooms. The body of the building (on the ground floor) consisted of twelve rooms on a square plan, while in the towers there were four rooms on a round plan (ca. 4 m in diameter). The building (remnant of a manor house or a palace) had two floors and was covered with roof tiles. Its southern elevation was enriched by an elongated projection which could have been a remnant of a shallow loggia or of some sort o f arcade construction stuck to the body of the building. The residence in Strawczyn was connected with investment activity of Jakub Stanisław Gawroński, Wieluń castellan in the years 1608 - 1624. The ground plan, the design of the described building, as well as its scale show evident similarity to an early baroque palace in Kielce, raised by Cracow bishop Jakub Zadzik (1637 - 1641), and consequently with a slightly bigger Tarło palace in Podzamcze Piekoszowskie, near Kielce, which was an imitation of the Kielce residence. High architectural rank of both palaces may suggest that the palace in Strawczyn may be considered as their imitation. However, the fact that the palace in Strawczyn dates to {{the first quarter of the}} 17 th century excludes such a possibility. In the final part of the text the author presents his own, possibly controversial interpretation. He suggests that the palace in Strawczyn is not an imitation of the palaces in Kielce and Podzamcze Piekoszowskie, but genetically it expresses the changes which residential buildings obviously underwent in the horizon of the year 1600. At that time, typical for the 16 th century, compact in plans, masonry manor houses began to take a form o f massive blocks built on elongated rectangular plans, clung in the corners by cylindrical hexahedral or octahedral towers. These changes were obviously influenced by trends in European early baroque palaces although we can not talk about a direct influence of "Italianism" of contemporary architecture. The latter formed, <b>axially</b> founded, <b>symmetrical</b> blocks of the residences of the magnates from the epoch of early baroque, which were raised in the second quarter of the 17 th century, namely the palaces in Kielce and Podzamcze Piekoszowskie.

5000|$|Rolling cone {{motion is}} the rolling motion {{generated}} by a cone rolling over another cone. In rolling cone motion, {{at least one of}} the cones is convex, while the other cone may be either convex, or concave, or a flat surface (a flat surface can be regarded as a special case of a cone whose apex angle equals [...] ). The distinguishing characteristic of a rolling cone, in relation to other <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> rollers (cylinder, sphere, round disk), is that while rolling on a flat surface, the cone's center of gravity performs a circular motion rather than a linear one. Another unique characteristic is that one of its points (its apex) is at rest throughout the entire motion.|$|E

50|$|In practice, due {{to small}} {{deformations}} near the contact area, some sliding and energy dissipation occurs. Nevertheless, the resulting rolling resistance {{is much lower}} than sliding friction, and thus, rolling objects, typically require much less energy to be moved than sliding ones. As a result, such objects will more easily move, if they experience a force with a component along the surface, for instance gravity on a tilted surface, wind, pushing, pulling, or torque from an engine. Unlike most <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> objects, the rolling motion of a cone is such that while rolling on a flat surface, its center of gravity performs a circular motion, rather than linear motion. Rolling objects are not necessarily axially-symmetrical. Two well known non-axially-symmetrical rollers are the Reuleaux triangle and the Meissner bodies. The oloid and the sphericon {{are members of a}} special family of developable rollers that develop their entire surface when rolling down a flat plane. Objects with corners, such as dice, roll by successive rotations about the edge or corner which is in contact with the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Capillary bridges {{have been}} studied for over 200 years. The {{question}} was raised {{for the first time}} by Josef Louis Lagrange in 1760, and interest was further spread by the French astronomer and mathematician C. Delaunay. Delaunay found an entirely new class of <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> surfaces of constant mean curvature. The formulation and the proof of his theorem had a long story. It began with Euler's proposition of new figure, called cathenoid. (Much later, Kenmotsu [...] solved the complex nonlinear equations, describing this class of surfaces. However, his solution is of little practical importance because it has no geometrical interpretation.) J. Plateau showed the existence of such shapes with given boundaries. The problem was named after him Plateau's problem. Many scientists contributed to the solution of the problem. One of them is Thomas Young. Pierre Simon Laplace contributed the notion of capillary tension. Laplace even formulated the widely known nowadays condition for mechanical equilibrium between two fluids, divided by a capillary surface Pγ=ΔP i.e. capillary pressure between two phases is balanced by their adjacent pressure difference.A general survey on capillary bridge behavior in gravity field is completed by Myshkis and Babskii.In the last century a lot of efforts were put of study of surface forces that drive capillary effects of bridging. There was established that these forces result from intermolecular forces and become significant in thin fluid gaps (<10 nm) between two surfaces. The instability of capillary bridges was discussed in first time by Rayleigh. He demonstrated that a liquid jet or capillary cylindrical surface became unstable when the ratio between its length, H to the radius R, becomes bigger than 2π. In these conditions of small sinusoidal perturbations with wavelength bigger than it perimeter, the cylinder surface area becomes larger than the one of unperturbed cylinder with the same volume and thus it becomes unstable. Later, Hove [...] formulated the variational requirements for the stability of axisymmetric capillary surfaces (unbounded) in absence of gravity and with disturbances constarined to constant volume. He first solved Young-Laplace equation for equilibrium shapes and showed that the Legendre condition for the second variation is always satisfied. Therefore the stability is determined by the absence of negative eigenvalue of the linearized Young-Laplace equation. This approach of determining stability from second variation is used now widely. Pertirbation methods became very successful despite that nonlinear nature of capillary interaction can limit their application. Other methods now include direct simulation. To that moment most methods for stability determination required calculation of equilibrium as a basis for perturbations. There appeared a new idea that stability may be deduced from equilibrium states. The proposition was further proven by Pitts for axisymmetric constant volume. In the following years Vogel extended the theory. He examined the case of axisymmetric capillary bridges with constant volumes and the stability changes correspond to turning points. The recent development of bifurcation theory proved that exchange of stability between turning points and branch points is a general phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|In the {{traditional}} metal forming product development paradigm, product design is generally based on heuristic know-how and experience, which are basically acquired through {{many years of}} practice. This kind of product design paradigm is of more trial-and-error than in-depth scientific calculation and analysis.

In this paper, flow-induced folding defect in forging of <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> flanged components is systematically investigated. A FE model to study the root-cause of the defect based on the material flow behavior is developed and a defect formation mechanism is revealed.
