In an interview O'Donnell wished that his software would easily upgrade to newer revisions; [...] "for {{the last twenty}} years of technology, every time a 'new' version of something comes out, the old version gets trashed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> unable to do something that I used to depend on," [...] he said. O'Donnell was involved in the implementation of his music as well as the composition, and was Bungie's Audio lead. He composed at Bungie from a sound-proofed room in the corner of Bungie's office, dubbed the [...] "Ivory Tower".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{weapons were}} very well received. Edge praised their weight, stating that each weapon {{encourages}} strategic {{play with their}} secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and {{that they did not}} feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how [...] "laughably bad it is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented, [...] "It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> being embarrassed for the voice actors." [...] Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the game's weapon fire and musical score [...] "easily drown this out." ...|$|E
500|$|Wheeler {{arrived in}} Bombay {{in the spring}} of 1944. There, he was welcomed by the city's governor, John Colville, before heading by train to Delhi and then Simla, where the {{headquarters}} of the Archaeological Survey of India were located. Wheeler had been suggested for the job by Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy of India, who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist Leonard Woolley, who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the British-controlled subcontinent. Wheeler recognised this state of affairs, in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment, commenting that [...] "We're back in 1850". He initially found much to dislike in India, and in his letters to friends in Britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward Indians: he stated that [...] "they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly... I already find myself regarding them as ill-made clockwork toys rather than as human beings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> bullying them most brutally." [...] He expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle, and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them.|$|E

"At {{times the}} forty winters that I passed in Haddam East Village {{seem like an}} alien experience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> pitying the life I lived there quite {{as if it were}} the life of some one else.

6000|$|A {{few such}} {{pictures}} {{of those early}} days at Beckenham stand out, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> among the Chiselhurst memories.

60|$|We {{have already}} a child, and Margaret was childless, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> prone to insist upon that, {{as if it}} was a justification. But, indeed, when we became lovers there was small thought of Eugenics between us. Ours was a mutual and not a philoprogenitive passion. Old Nature behind us may have had such {{purposes}} with us, but it is not for us to annex her intentions by a moralising afterthought. There isn't, in fact, any decent justification for us whatever--at that the story must stand.|$|E

60|$|We shall then realise {{that the}} actual naval weapons are these smaller weapons, and {{especially}} the destroyer, the submarine, and the waterplane--the waterplane most of all, because of its possibilities of a comparative bigness--in the hands of competent and daring men. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself,</b> as a patriotic Englishman, more and more troubled by doubts whether we are as certainly superior to any possible adversary in these essential things as {{we are in the}} matter of Dreadnoughts. I find myself awake at nights, after a day much agitated by a belligerent Press, wondering whether the real Empire of the Sea may not even now have slipped out of our hands while our attention has been fixed on our stately procession of giant warships, while our country has been in a dream, hypnotised by the Dreadnought idea.|$|E
