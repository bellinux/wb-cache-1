5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare (Lepus starcki) is {{a medium-sized}} species of mammal in the rabbit and hare family, Leporidae. Its dorsal pelage is grizzled, buff white and spotted and streaked with black, while its belly fur is pure white <b>and</b> <b>fluffy.</b> It is endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands, ranging over the Afroalpine {{regions of the}} Shoa, Bale, and Arsi Provinces of Ethiopia. A herbivore, it mostly feeds on moorland grasses. The IUCN rates it as a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white <b>and</b> <b>fluffy,</b> remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense <b>and</b> <b>fluffy,</b> but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

25|$|The general {{tone of the}} fur is reddish, {{with the}} {{brightest}} hues occurring in winter. In the winter coat, the back is clothed in a saturated rusty-red to reddish colour with brownish highlights {{along the top of}} the head, neck and shoulders.

The lower parts of the limbs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs. The muzzle and forehead are greyish-reddish. The tail is very luxuriant <b>and</b> <b>fluffy,</b> and is mainly of a reddish-ocherous colour, with a dark brown tip. The summer coat is shorter, coarser, and darker. The dorsal and lateral guard hairs in adults measure 20–30mm in length. Dholes in the Moscow Zoo moult once a year from March to May.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{continues}} {{his work on}} other experiments, attempting to use his daughter's dog, Fluffy, as a test subject for his own teleportation device. However, the experiment fails, <b>and</b> <b>Fluffy</b> is transformed into an undead Hellhound. Richtofen takes the opportunity and traps Maxis and his daughter Samantha inside the teleporter with Fluffy, believing that they would die. Richtofen escapes with his three captured soldiers, and arrives at the Rising Sun research facility in Japan, where Element 115 was first discovered. After gathering a sample of 115 at the site, and recovering a weapon known as the Wunderwaffe DG-2, they return to the Der Riese factory in Germany. In an attempt to escape the zombie horde, the group accidentally overloads a teleporter with the DG-2, sending them forward in time.

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} were of {{the highest}} quality for the Nintendo 64 at the time. Smith praised general aspects of the game's graphics such as their crispness, detail, smoothness, and lack of polygon dropout. Reviewers praised the game's camera use, the game's [...] "very solid" [...] physics model, the impression of racers' speed, and the game's snow effects (sun reflected in the snow as appropriate, <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> snow and packed snow appeared and behaved differently). Graphical faults included occasional pop-up, misplaced shadows, and lag when racers passed through on-track trees; these problems were generally identified as minor.|$|E
500|$|A {{patch of}} pennaceous {{feathers}} is found running along its back, which was {{quite similar to}} the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers.

These occur on the remainder of the body—although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens—and the lower neck.|$|E
500|$|Billy Grifter from Den of Geek was {{slightly}} {{disappointed with the}} [...] "mad scientist" [...] storyline as he felt it had been done before, but found several redeeming qualities: Alan Ruck's performance and the last five minutes featuring Noble and Blair Brown, and Torv with Joshua Jackson. Grifter thought the Noble-Brown scene was [...] "actually very funny," [...] praising the two actors' performances, and added that this humor made the following Torv-Jackson scene's impact [...] "even greater". Referring to Torv's [...] "passable" [...] Nimoy impression, Grifter concluded that [...] "the strength of Fringe {{is that it can}} take a rather light <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> premise, like the one in [...] "Os", and embellish it with wonderful character moments and a genuine surprise or two".|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people are doing something you would never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{gave the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, {{describing}} it as [...] "slight <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> and silly, with the occasional creaky bit of plotting ... but enormously entertaining". He was pleased that the guest characters were played [...] "straight" [...] rather than for comedy, and found the dinosaur effects [...] "great" [...] and the Silurian twist [...] "enriching continuity". However, he felt that the teaser was too fast-paced, Nefertiti was [...] "rather bland", and wrote that it was unlikely the Doctor would have a friendship with a big game hunter. IGN's Matt Risley rated [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] 7 out of 10, noting that it [...] "isn't going to win any awards for scriptwriting or pathos, but it certainly succeeded on a family-friendly level full of whimsy". Though he wrote that Brian was [...] "brilliant", he overall criticised the [...] "gang", feeling that they [...] "served little purpose other than to inject some conveniently timed plot devices when needed". He also did not like the [...] "bickering Marvin the Paranoid Android-lite" [...] robots.

Brad Trechak of AOL TV felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes. He praised the episode for being [...] "light <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> yet it furthered things along with regard to the Torchwood universe and its characters". Reviewing the episode Brigid Cherry of Total Sci-Fi felt that [...] "contrary to expectation– it’s hilarious".

500|$|The {{gray wolf}} has very dense <b>and</b> <b>fluffy</b> winter fur, with short underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. Most of the underfur {{and some of}} the guard hairs are shed in the spring and grow back in the autumn period. The longest hairs occur on the back, {{particularly}} on the front quarters and neck. Especially long hairs are on the shoulders, and almost form a crest on {{the upper part of the}} neck. The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts. The ears are covered in short hairs, which strongly project from the fur. Short, elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbows down to the calcaneal tendons. The winter fur is highly resistant to cold; wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at −40° by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it. In warm climates, the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves. Female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males, and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age. Older wolves generally have more white hairs in the tip of the tail, along the nose and on the forehead. The winter fur is retained longest in lactating females, though with some hair loss around their nipples. Hair length on the middle of the back is [...] Hair length of the guard hairs on the shoulders generally does not exceed , but can reach [...]|$|E
