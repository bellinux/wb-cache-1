5|$|In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, {{daughter}} Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It was cold and lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, Pearce.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Scotland the Firth of Clyde was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> is much {{affected}} by glaciation. Arran's highest peaks may have been nunataks at this time. After the last retreat of the ice sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting post glacial coastlines a complex task but the resultant clifflines behind raised beaches are a prominent feature of the entire coastline.|$|E

5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has a {{dense network}} of towns, where large, medium and small towns are complementary. The plateau is very densely {{populated}} with about 450 people per km2 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> continually {{shows signs of}} human presence. The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase. In international comparison {{the importance of these}} urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests. In addition the two main centres of Zürich and Geneva are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> is much {{affected}} by glaciation, {{and to a lesser}} extent by subsequent sea level changes. In the post-glacial epoch, circa 6100 BC, Scotland and the Faeroe Islands experienced a tsunami up to 20 metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip off the coast of Norway. Earth tremors are infrequent and usually slight. The Great Glen is the most seismically active area of Britain, but the last event of any size was in 1901.|$|E

5|$|In Livingston County, I-96 {{passes to}} the south of Fowlerville and Howell. Near the Livingston County Spencer J. Hardy Airport on the western edge of Howell, I-96 meets M-59, which carries the Howell {{business}} loop easterly to Grand River Avenue. The freeway expands to six lanes and runs parallel to Grand River Avenue on the southern side of town. The business loop reconnects near Lake Chemung {{on the east side of}} town, and I-96 turns further {{to the south}}east. On the northeast side of Brighton, I-96 crosses over Grand River Avenue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> transitions to include residential subdivisions. I-96 crosses US23 and enters the far northwestern edge of Metro Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs in the park <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> {{protection}} area each year. Bears {{can also be found}} in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich {{began his}} formal study {{of art in}} 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art {{department}} is now named Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature was a revelation of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich {{to the work of}} the German 17th-century artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery's collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the Sturm und Drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo-classical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.|$|E

25|$|The {{house is}} built on a steep {{hillside}} in the Hollywood Hills {{at a time when}} the hills did not have the rich foliage present today. At the time of its construction, Storer House is said to have resembled a Pompeiian villa. Frank Lloyd Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, was both the on-site construction manager <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> architect, providing an illusion of a ruin barely visible within its jungle environment.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of this divide, the {{elevation}} of the hilltops gradually decreases, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> is more gently rolling. Within 30 miles (50 kilometers) of the coast, few hills exceed 300 feet (100 meters) in elevation. Near the coast, swamps, marshes, and ponds alternate with low hills. However, the Blue Hills, just south of Boston, rise above the surrounding landscape. The state probably {{takes its name from}} the Massachusett name for their highest point, Great Blue Hill, with an elevation of 635 feet (194 meters).|$|E
25|$|Slowly, however, {{time has}} healed this {{difference}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> at Abney Park has grown closer to its New World cousin. Mature trees and woodland now adorn Abney Park, completing its transformation into a woodland cemetery. This {{has been so}} profound a change that by the early 1990s the cemetery was acknowledged {{to be the largest}} woodland ecosystem in North London so close to the centre of the City of London, and became designated as the first statutory Local Nature Reserve in the London Borough of Hackney.|$|E
