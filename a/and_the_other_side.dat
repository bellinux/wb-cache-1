5|$|There are two {{ornamental}} woods {{within the}} grounds, Summercombe Wood and Luscombe Wood. Luscombe Wood covers an area {{south of the}} house, through the centre of which runs a private road known as The Terrace. The wood is made up primarily of deciduous trees, interspaced with laurels. It also includes an 18th-century pine plantation {{to the east of}} the woods. The north-west boundary of the woods is Haldon Lane <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the road is Summercombe Wood. Summercombe has largely been replanted {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, but the original 19th century drive follows a stream through the valley past a pond to a stone bridge to two further areas of nearby woodland. At the west side of Summercombe Wood, there is a 19th-century lodge, Haldon Lodge.|$|E

25|$|Other games {{included}} using corn, cane, and moccasins. The corn game used five {{to seven}} kernels of corn. One side was blackened <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> white. Players won points based on each color. One point was awarded for the black side and 5–7 points for the white side. There were usually only two players.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} checkmates when one side has only his king <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> has only the minimum material needed to force checkmate, i.e. (1) one queen, (2) one rook, (3) two bishops on opposite-colored squares, or (4) a bishop and a knight. The king must help in accomplishing {{all of these}} checkmates. If the superior side has more material, checkmates are easier.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of PEDF was successfully generated. The PEDF structure includes 3 beta sheets and 10 alpha helices. This discovery demonstrated that PEDF has an asymmetrical charge distribution {{across the whole}} protein. One side of the protein is heavily basic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> is heavily acidic, leading to a polar 3-D structure. They proposed that the basic side of the protein contains a heparin binding site.|$|E

25|$|Wallenberg {{syndrome}} (lateral medullary syndrome) is {{a clinical}} {{demonstration of the}} anatomy of the trigeminal nerve, summarizing how it processes sensory information. A stroke usually affects only {{one side of the}} body; loss of sensation due to a stroke will be lateralized to the right or {{the left side of the}} body. The only exceptions to this rule are certain spinal-cord lesions and the medullary syndromes, of which Wallenberg syndrome is the best-known example. In this syndrome, a stroke causes a loss of pain-temperature sensation from one side of the face <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the body.|$|E

Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that {{one side of the}} mushroom will make her taller <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|E
25|$|At {{the launch}} of their new car BAR {{unveiled}} separate liveries for their cars; Villeneuve's car painted in a white and red Lucky Strike livery and Zonta's carrying a blue and yellow 555 livery. The FIA deemed the dual liveries illegal under F1 regulations which state that a team's cars must carry largely identical liveries. BAR lodged {{a complaint with the}} International Chamber of Commerce (as permitted under F1's regulations) but simultaneously lodged a complaint with the European Commission. Pollock was summoned to the World Motor Sport Council to explain the team behaviour. A potential fine and/or ban was averted when Pollock agreed to abide by the F1 arbitration process, admitted that in filing the complaint to the EC his lawyers had acted independently and that declarations made in the claim did not reflect his personal views. He also apologised to the Council and reiterated his acceptance of the FIA's authority. To get around the ban BAR ran one side of their cars painted in the Lucky Strike colours, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> in the blue and yellow of 555. BAR reverted to a more traditional style of livery for 2000 onwards.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason that}} spin on a {{football}} makes it curl {{is known as the}} Magnus effect. This causes a rotating ball to form a whirlpool about itself, with one side's air moving with <b>the</b> ball <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> air moving against the ball. This creates a difference in air pressure, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ball deviates from its path as a result of this.|$|R

500|$|A [...] "keep pounding" [...] chant was {{introduced}} during the 2015 season which starts {{before the opening}} kickoff of each home game. As prompted by the video boards, {{one side of the}} stadium shouts [...] "keep" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> replies with [...] "pounding". The chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games.|$|E
500|$|Endgames can be {{classified}} according {{to the type of}} pieces remaining on the board. Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides, and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings, such as [...] "rook and pawn versus rook" [...] endgames.|$|E
500|$|The CD {{release was}} a DualDisc; {{one side of}} the disc played the album, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> functioned as a DVD, {{featuring}} animated music videos for many of the songs on the record. Straight Outta Lynwood was met with mostly positive reviews, with many critics praising [...] "White & Nerdy" [...] and [...] "Trapped in the Drive-Thru". Some of the other parody songs, however, were met with a more mixed response. The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200. [...] "White & Nerdy" [...] became Yankovic's highest-charting single, as well as his first Platinum-certified single. The record itself was certified Gold for shipments of over 500,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Fringes {{premise is}} based on the idea of two {{parallel}} universes, our own <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side,</b> each of which contains historical idiosyncrasies. The two universes began to clash in 1985, after Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) stole the parallel universe version of his son, Peter, following his own son's death. The finale's narrative recounts what happens when Peter (Joshua Jackson) is taken back to the Other Side by his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble). FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and Walter lead a team of former Cortexiphan test subjects to retrieve him, after discovering that Peter is an unwitting part of Walternate's plans to bring about the destruction of our universe using an ancient doomsday device.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, {{controversy}} erupted over a [...] street kiosk at {{the foot}} of the Magnificent Mile in front of the Wrigley Building at 410 North Michigan Avenue that advertised Trump Tower a full block away. Extensive debate and publicity occurred on the issue of whether such advertising should have been allowed. Two distinct pieces of legislation in 2002 and 2003 by the Chicago City Council had authorized the kiosk, but sidewalk billboards were not common in Chicago at the time, and their desirability was questioned. Although there were demands from citizens' organizations and the local Alderman Burton Natarus (who had voted in favor of the legislation) to remove the kiosk, Trump agreed only to remove pricing information from the signage, after a request to remove all advertising from it. Originally, one side displayed the geographical information <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> functioned as a billboard.|$|E
500|$|In {{this first}} set of letters Franklin talked about {{electrical}} fire, later (1749) changing the terminology to electrical fluid. He wrote to Collinson on June 5, 1747, that his experiments showed that the electrical fire was a new element of matter existing as particles in all ordinary matter. [...] Franklin determined that a friction rubbing process like that of rubbing glass with a cloth does not create these particles, but only temporararily groups them together {{so that they can}} be collected and held in a Leyden jar of water and metal. According to Franklin, one side of the Leyden jar had an accumulation of electrical fire, which he labeled as positive (plus), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> had a deficiency of electrical fire, labeled negative (minus). These losses and gains of electrification were exactly equal and are essentially the modern law of charge conservation except that it is now recognized that negative charges exist in their own right, not just as a deficiency of positive charges. It is an important principle in modern science that explains the microphysics of the electrification of gross bodies. In these letters, Franklin introduced technical words that we use today for things related to electricity such as plus, minus, positive, negative, charge, discharge, armature, electric shock, electrician, condenser, conductor, and battery.|$|E
