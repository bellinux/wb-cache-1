The Tintinologists Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier commented that [...] "Everything that made Tintin what it later became was seminally present in Totor", including the artistic style, {{the pace of}} the story, the use of humour, {{and the manner in which}} it imitated motion pictures. They also commented that Totor read like [...] "an adult was retelling one of those early American western serials... to a group of children. On the one hand he is exciting the children, but on the other he is winking at the adults as if to say, [...] "you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> is not serious."" ...|$|E

At a very young age, she witnessed {{the murder of her}} mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E

And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2006, {{civil rights}} activist Al Sharpton was invited on Fox's The O'Reilly Factor to discuss the case. Sharpton began the {{interview}} by commending the [...] "blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community {{to stand up for}} this girl." [...] In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, [...] "First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?" [...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. [...] "I don't know yet and I think that the proper {{thing to do is to}} support those that want justice." ...|$|E

My beloved friend and reader, I wish you and I could do the same: and let me whisper my belief, ENTRE NOUS that of those eminent philosophers who cry out against parsons the loudest, there are not many who have got their knowledge of the church by going thither often.|$|E

In 1991 he attended a training session with renowned Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitor Rickson Gracie.

So much for things temporal. If you are fit to rule, in time you will rule; if you do not, then be content and acknowledge your own incapacity. And as for things spiritual, I am sure of this--though of course one does not like to talk much of these matters--if you only seek for them long enough in some shape you will find them, though the shape may not be that which is generally recognised by any particular religion. But {{to build a wall}} deliberately between oneself and the unseen, and then complain that the way is barred, is simply childish." ...|$|E
