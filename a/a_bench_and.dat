5|$|Güell's {{first task}} for Gaudí, that same year, was {{the design of}} the {{furniture}} for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaudí's teacher, {{at the request of the}} Marquis of Comillas, Güell's father in law. Gaudí designed a chair, <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Llorenç Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October Banksy's art was {{displayed}} in a shop window, unbeknownst to the owners. Banksy had purchased a very basic painting of a landscape, added his own special touch {{in the form of}} a Nazi in full uniform resting on <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> enjoying the view, and donated it back to the store, drastically increasing their patronage for the day.|$|E

25|$|The court {{heard that}} the Goughs' {{contract}} required them to bring up Dennis O'Neill {{as one of their}} own children in return for £1 per week. The court heard much the same testimony as in the committal hearings. However, it appeared that Terence had initially been somewhat confused about the sequence of events. The prosecution claimed that Dennis was tied to <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> beaten with a stick for eating a swede the day before he died.|$|E
25|$|At Taormina {{they check}} into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's {{employer}} Ettore {{and his wife}} Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party Sandro checks out the women—recognizing the beautiful aspiring actress Gloria Perkins. Back in the room Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro having sex with Gloria Perkins on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits down on <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she places {{her hand on his}} head in a gesture of compassion and comfort while looking out at the snow-covered image of Mount Etna on the horizon.|$|E
500|$|Service {{was inaugurated}} on June8, 1999, on a [...] route from Portway Street to 36thStreet. The {{principal}} boarding location {{was at the}} Columbia River Maritime Museum (at 17thStreet and approximately {{the middle of the}} route), and initially there were no other set stops. Several designated stops were added later, and some of these include <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> small shelter. [...] Passengers are still permitted to flag-down the trolley in between the posted stops.|$|E

500|$|In 1990 Historic Scotland {{said that}} Kinloch Farmhouse, in St Fergus {{featured}} <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> chair salvaged from the Pitfour Chapel. In 2003, the second [...] chapel was renovated and {{converted to a}} private residence. The chapel restoration won a [...] "Highly commended" [...] award for craftsmanship from Aberdeenshire Council in 2010; the council said the craftsmanship [...] "allowed for the retention of the ecclesiastical spirit and integrity to remain prevalent both internally and externally." [...] It was also [...] "Highly Commended" [...] in the conservation category.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Verschoyle Phillip Cronyn later {{described}} his harrowing return flight. Being the rare targeted pilot to escape Voss's gun fire, he {{now had to}} coax home a failing machine destined for the scrapheap. He lost control of it banking for the landing pattern, and finally performed a desperate high speed landing at 18:40 hours, approximately coincidental with the triplane's impact. The 56 Squadron commander, Major Blomfield, led the shaky-kneed pilot from his machine to <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> plied him with medicinal brandy. Cronyn's composure broke. After a fit of weeping, he pulled himself together as McCudden landed, followed by Rhys-Davids. The latter exited his machine hyperventilating and stammering. He got his tot of brandy, and uttered an account jumbled by his excitement. With the exception of Muspratt, who had landed at the 1 Squadron aerodrome with a seized engine, the rest of 56 Squadron landed back at Estrée-Blanche. Combat reports by the pilots were written and submitted; those from McCudden, Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Maybery, Hoidge, and Gardiner still exist. These fragmentary written documents would be supplemented by McCudden's autobiography, written before his death the following year; contradictory written accounts produced by Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman in 1942; and Cronyn's memoirs of 1976. When corresponding with aviation historian Evan Hadingham in 1967, Cronyn offered, [...] "...movements were purely instinctive, and made on such split second action that no impression was recorded." [...] He offered as example that he was unaware he {{had spent most of}} his fight with Voss flying inverted until Muspratt mentioned it in the mess the evening of the fight.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Beautiful" [...] {{was directed by}} Jonas Åkerlund and premiered on December 9, 2002. It opens with Aguilera speaking the line [...] "Don't look at me", followed by scenes of her singing alone in a room intercut with self-image-related sequences of other people. An anorexic girl examines herself in a mirror, eventually punching through it; a thin teenage boy stands lifting weights in a room plastered with images of bodybuilders; and an African-American girl rips out pages of women's magazines including photos of only white women and throws them into a fire. In one sequence, a girl is physically bullied by several peers, and in another, a goth man sits {{at the back of}} a bus while several people get up and move. The video also touches on LGBT issues; one scene features a gay couple, portrayed by Jordan Shannon and Justin Croft, kissing on <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> ignoring the stares of people who pass them. Another shows a transgender person, played by Robert Sherman, putting on makeup, a wig, and women's clothing. The music video debuted at number 2 on Total Request Live, spending a total of fifty days on the chart and retiring at number 6. It topped MuchMusic's Countdown for two consecutive weeks and remained on the countdown for fifteen weeks. The video received a Special Recognition award, presented by David LaChapelle, from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation at its 14th GLAAD Media Awards. After an a cappella performance of the song, Aguilera stated in her acceptance speech that [...] "this song is definitely a universal message that everybody can relate to– anyone that's been discriminated against or unaccepted, unappreciated or disrespected just because of who you are." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 2006 Centennial Celebration Kickoff {{launched}} with a [...] "pilgrimage" [...] to Cornell University on November 19, 2005. That event {{brought over}} 700 fraternity members who {{gathered for a}} day-long program. Members journeyed across campus and unveiled a new centennial memorial to Alpha Phi Alpha.

2500|$|After {{hearing of}} the fall of the Alamo, the {{chairman}} of the convention, Richard Ellis, wanted to adjourn the convention and begin again in Nacogdoches. [...] Burnet leaped onto <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> made a speech asking the delegates to stay and finish their business. [...] They did so, and the new constitution was adopted that evening. [...] The frontrunners for the presidency of the new country, Austin, Sam Houston, and William H. Wharton, were absent from the convention, so the nominees became Burnet and Samuel Price Carson. [...] Burnet won, on a vote of 2923, {{in the early hours of}} March 17, becoming the interim president of the new Republic of Texas. [...] De Zavala was elected vice president.|$|E

2500|$|A {{group of}} UDA women then {{followed}} the minibus which brought Ogilby and Sharlene to a disused bakery in Hunter Street, Sandy Row; this empty building {{had been converted}} into a UDA club and [...] "romper room". After Sharlene was sent by Graham to a shop to buy sweets, Ogilby was made to sit on <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> a hood placed over her head. Two teenagers, Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith, acting on the orders previously given them by the unit's leader, Elizabeth [...] "Lily" [...] Douglas, proceeded to savagely beat Ogilby to death with bricks and sticks. As Ogilby screamed and pleaded for her life, Sharlene, who had already returned from the shop, overheard her mother being beaten and killed. A later autopsy report revealed that Ogilby had sustained 24 blows to the head and body, 14 of which caused a [...] "severe fracture to the bulk of the skull".|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] “The stout-hearted are {{bereft of}} sense, they sleep their sleep,” a Midrash taught that the {{expression}} “bereft of sense” applied to Moses and Aaron. [...] They sent the spies, who slandered the land, {{so that they}} did not know what to do. [...] Moses and Aaron lost courage, but Caleb immediately rose and silenced all of the people, as [...] reports, “And Caleb stilled ( [...] , vayahas) the people.” He stood on <b>a</b> <b>bench</b> <b>and</b> silenced them, saying, “Silence (has)!” and they became silent to hear him. [...] Caleb told them in [...] “The land [...] [...] [...] is an exceeding good land.” God therefore said to Moses, “I am exceedingly grateful to him ,” as may be inferred from [...] “Except (zulati) Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it [...] [...] [...] because he has wholly followed the Lord.” The word zulati signified lazeh itti, “this one was with Me,” more than the 600,000 other Israelites, who could not find your hands and feet, but failed in courage. [...] Thus [...] says, “The stout-hearted are bereft of sense.” The Midrash taught that it came to this because the messengers that Moses and Aaron sent were fools. [...] Of such as these [...] observes, “He that sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet, and drinks damage.” ...|$|E
