40|$|Purpose: The {{analysis}} of uncertainty in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) studies has been a topic for more than 10 years, and many commercial LCA programs now feature a sampling approach called Monte Carlo analysis. Yet, a full Monte Carlo {{analysis of}} a large LCA system, for instance containing the 4, 000 unit processes of ecoinvent v 2. 2, is rarely carried out by LCA practitioners. One {{reason for this is}} computation time. An alternative faster than Monte Carlo method is analytical error propagation by means of a Taylor series expansion; however, this approach suffers from being explained in the literature in conflicting ways, hampering implementation in most software packages for LCA. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare the two different approaches from a theoretical and practical perspective. Methods: In this paper, we compare the <b>analytical</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> approaches in terms of their theoretical background and their mathematical formulation. Using three case studies-one stylized, one real-sized, and one input-output (IO) -based-we approach these techniques from a practical perspective and compare them in terms of speed and results. Results: Depending on the precise question, a sampling or an analytical approach provides more useful information. Whenever they provide the same indicators, an analytical approach is much faster but less reliable when the uncertainties are large. Conclusions: For a good analysis, <b>analytical</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> approaches are equally important, and we recommend practitioners to use both whenever available, and we recommend software suppliers to implement both. © 2014 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFormaldehyde is of {{particular}} health concern since it is carcinogenic for human and ubiquitous in indoor air where people {{spend most of their}} time. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} suitable methods and techniques to measure its content in indoor air. In the present work, four different techniques have been tested in the INERIS exposure chamber and in indoor environments in comparison to a standard active method: passive sampling method based on the reaction of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine with formaldehyde, two on-line continuous monitoring systems based on fluorescence and UV measurements and a portable commercialised analyser based on electrochemical titration. Two formaldehyde concentrations, about 10 and 25 μg m− 3 were generated in an exposure chamber under controlled conditions of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed to simulate real conditions and assess potential influence on passive <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> continuous <b>systems</b> response. Influence of sampling periods on passive sampling has also been evaluated. The real atmosphere experiments have been performed in four different indoor environments: an office, a furniture shop, a shopping mall, and residential dwellings in which several potential formaldehyde sources linked to household activities have been tested. The <b>analytical</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> problems associated with each measurement method have been identified and discussed.

40|$|A {{spatially}} {{distributed system}} contains {{a large amount}} of agents with limited sensing, data processing, and communication capabilities. Recent technological advances have opened up possibilities to deploy spatially distributed <b>systems</b> for signal <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a graph structure for a distributed <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction <b>system</b> by coupling agents in a spatially distributed system with innovative positions of signals. A fundamental problem in sampling theory is the robustness of signal reconstruction in the presence of sampling noises. For a distributed <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction <b>system,</b> the robustness could be reduced to the stability of its sensing matrix. In a traditional centralized <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction <b>system,</b> the stability of the sensing matrix could be verified by its central processor, but the above procedure is infeasible in a distributed <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction <b>system</b> as it is decentralized. In this paper, we split a distributed <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction <b>system</b> into a family of overlapping smaller subsystems, and we show that the stability of the sensing matrix holds if and only if its quasi-restrictions to those subsystems have uniform stability. This new stability criterion could be pivotal for the design of a robust distributed <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> reconstruction <b>system</b> against supplement, replacement and impairment of agents, as we only need to check the uniform stability of affected subsystems. In this paper, we also propose an exponentially convergent distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, that provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal in the presence of bounded sampling noises...|$|R

40|$|Exposures to lead have {{emanated from}} various sources, {{including}} food, throughout human history. Occupational and environmental exposures (especially pica) appear {{to account for}} much of the identified human disease, however, food-borne exposures deserve further investigation. Lead residues in food can result from: biological uptake from soils into plants consumed by food animals or man, usage of lead arsenate pesticides, inadvertent addition during food processing, and by leaching them improperly glazed pottery used as food storage or dining utensils. Estimates of total dietary exposure should reflect frequency distribution data on lead levels in specific food commodities in relation to the quantities actually ingested by various sample populations to distinguish degrees of risk associated with particular dietary habits. Earlier estimates of average total dietary intake of lead by adults have been reported to range from above 500 μg/day downward with more recent estimates suggesting averages of 200 μg/day or lower.

Materials in some streams are determined using validated models, which include the mass and composition of the input spent fuel.
