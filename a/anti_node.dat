40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} into combustion instability were undertaken using a rectangular subscale combustion chamber. High speed optical diagnostics {{were used to}} observe flame-acoustic interactions. A sector wheel was used to produce an acoustic field with time varying amplitude. The acoustic field under investigation is the first transverse mode with a velocity <b>anti</b> <b>node</b> located in the central combustion zone under observation by high speed optical diagnostics. Increased combustion product emission was observed near to the face plate for periods of high amplitude excitation. Combustion zones with high emission were convected downstream as excitation amplitudes decreased. During phases of increasing amplitude an increase in emission intensity at the mixing border between dense oxygen and cryogenic hydrogen was observed. This provides visual confirmation of increased mixing efficiency due to high amplitude transverse velocities {{in the vicinity of}} the injection plane...|$|E
40|$|With a model {{combustion}} chamber {{the interaction of}} an acoustic excitation with a burning LOX/H 2 spray was investigated. Pressure oscillations are coupled into the {{combustion chamber}} by an additional exhaust nozzle and a siren wheel. Due {{to the fact that}} the orientation of the excited acoustic modes can be fixed with this secondary nozzle it is possible to investigate the interaction of acoustics with combustion chamber processes like injection, atomization, vaporization, mixture formation and combustion either with the spray in a pressure node or <b>anti</b> <b>node.</b> Thus the role of pressure or velocity coupling with the processes mentioned above can be studied. For a variety of injection conditions the interaction of the acoustic excitation with the spray flame has been investigated. Only damped acoustic oscillations have been observed, at no operating conditions combustion instabilities were found. High speed visualization of the OH emission of the flame is used to get information on the spatially and temporally resolved evolution of the heat release. From the OH-emission and dynamic pressure recordings a response factor of the combustion process is determined for the case of the excitation of the first tangential mode (1 T). The acoustic 1 T-resonances of the combustor show non-Lorentzian line profiles. There is indication that the excited modes are not pure but that there is always a superposition of various different eigenmodes in the combustion chamber. This complex dynamics of the acoustic field is not well understood up to now...|$|E
40|$|Home {{security}} system {{is needed for}} occupants' convenience and safety. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an affordable, low power consumption, and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) based wireless home {{security system}}. In existing system, the home network is engaged with non-wireless technology, where the installation and maintenance is difficult. So the system cost is very high. In our proposed system, these difficulties are overcome by introducing a wireless home network which contains a GPRS Gateway and three kinds of security nodes namely door security <b>node,</b> <b>anti</b> intrusion <b>node</b> and SMS node to inform the user. The nodes are easy installing. All the three nodes {{are connected to the}} microcontroller...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} experiment, sonoluminescence {{was observed in}} aerated water, especially at the pressure <b>anti</b> <b>nodes</b> in the standing-wave field of a physiotherapeutic ultrasound device (Therasonic 1030). Mammalian cells in vitro showed growth inhibition when placed at the pressure antinodes but not at adjacent pressure nodes. In the light of these results, we looked for sonoluminescence in vivo when a similar standing-wave field was set up. To detect luminescence, a light guide was held against the inner surface of the human cheek. This would channel any luminescence photons to a cooled, red sensitive photomultiplier which would quantify the light. Direct insonation of the cheek produced no detectable luminescence. Similarly when a water bag was placed against the outer surface of the cheek, and the latter was insonated through the bag, no luminescence was detected. Sonoluminescence from the water bag was, however, detected when the bag was placed against the inner surface of the cheek, showing that absorption of sound by the cheek tissue was not preventing cavitation. Further analysis showed that if cavitation had been occurring in the cheek without detection using the system employed, then the resulting sonoluminescence {{would have to be}} at most 0. 025 times as intense as that produced by an equivalent volume of aerated wate...|$|R
