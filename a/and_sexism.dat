5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny <b>and</b> <b>sexism.</b> Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E

50|$|Most {{research}} done on hostile prejudice {{has been done}} on hostile <b>sexism.</b> Peter Glick <b>and</b> Susan Fiske, along with several other colleagues, did a study on hostile <b>and</b> benevolent <b>sexism</b> across cultures. Glick and his colleagues found that hostile <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> benevolent <b>sexism</b> are consistent notions that have a positive relationship to each other across nations. Women and men are viewed by hostile sexism as opposites in that women try to control men by domesticated means (e.g., marriage, demands for attention, and material possessions), forcing men to attempt to hang on to their independence and keep their masculinity. Glick and colleagues found that, if sexism in a culture is high overall, then women will tend to reject hostile sexism over benevolent sexism when it comes to men. They also found that, based on national averages on hostile <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> benevolent <b>sexism,</b> predictions can be made regarding gender inequality across nations.|$|R

5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, <b>and</b> <b>sexism,</b> and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension <b>and</b> <b>sexism</b> of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

50|$|While many {{individuals}} endorse both benevolent <b>and</b> hostile <b>sexism</b> simultaneously, {{research suggests that}} people rated significantly higher {{in one of the}} two sub-components have distinct constellations of beliefs and patterns of behavior. In other words, someone who is high in benevolent sexism tends to show a different profile of attitudes than someone who is high in hostile sexism. The independence of these types of sexism in predicting human behavior indicates that the two are, in fact, discrete forms of bias on separate but related axes. Examples of research findings identifying disparate outcomes between benevolent <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> hostile <b>sexism</b> are described below. In addition, the relationships between ambivalent <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> a range of other related attitudes and behaviors are discussed.|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} the study were to analyze {{differences}} as a function of gender, age, and educational level in <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> alexithymia in a nonclinical and in a clinical sample, and to explore the relation between these constructs.

The sample comprised 989 participants from the Basque Country, aged between 18 and 65 years. The results revealed: 1) Significantly higher scores in the males in <b>sexism</b> (hostile, benevolent, <b>and</b> ambivalent) and in alexithymia (difficulties to express emotions and external-oriented thinking) in both samples; in the total alexithymia score, the males had significantly higher scores only in the nonclinical sample; 2) As of 55 years of age, a significant increase in benevolent <b>and</b> ambivalent <b>sexism,</b> <b>and</b> in difficulties to identify emotions, external-oriented thinking, and in the total alexithymia score were observed (only in the nonclinical sample); however, no changes with age were observed in hostile <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> in difficulties to express emotions; 3) A decrease in <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> alexithymia as the educational level increased; and 4) Significant positive correlations between <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> alexithymia...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has examined the}} relationship between the Modern Sexism Scale (Swim, Aikin, Hall & Hunter, 1995) <b>and</b> the Ambivalent <b>Sexism</b> Inventory (ASI; Glick & Fiske, 1996) or the relationship between the Modern <b>Sexism</b> Scale <b>and</b> the Neosexism Scale (Campbell, Schellenberg, & Senn, 1997; Tougas, Brown, Beaten, & Joly, 1995). The present study {{examined the relationship between}} the ASI and the Neosexism Scale. Across three samples (N = 907), neosexism was found to be associated primarily with the hostile rather than the benevolent component of ambivalent sexism. Hostile <b>sexism,</b> benevolent <b>sexism,</b> <b>and</b> neosexism were all significantly associated with attitudes toward lesbians 2 ̆ 7 and gay men 2 ̆ 7 s rights, <b>and</b> both hostile <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> neosexism were significantly associated with attitudes toward women 2 ̆ 7 s rights. Neosexism <b>and</b> hostile <b>sexism</b> were negatively associated with a humanitarian-egalitarian orientation, whereas benevolent sexism was positively associated with a Protestant-ethic orientation. It is concluded that, although both the Neosexism Scale and ASI measure contemporary sexism, only the Benevolent Sexism subscale of the ASI taps the subjectively positive side of contemporary sexism...|$|R

50|$|Overall, {{women are}} rarely {{perceived}} by others {{in an entirely}} hostile or benevolent manner. In fact, people frequently report high levels of both benevolent <b>and</b> hostile <b>sexism.</b> There are individual differences in people's levels of benevolent <b>and</b> hostile <b>sexism,</b> such that a person can be rated highly on both, one, or neither dimension of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. In addition, women are not immune from endorsing sexist beliefs about women. Extensive research supports {{the idea that it}} is common for women and men to support ambivalently sexist attitudes about women. Despite this, people find it difficult to believe that others can endorse both benevolent <b>and</b> hostile <b>sexism.</b> Research suggests that, when individuals are shown profiles of a benevolently sexist man and a man who endorses hostile sexism, they feel that it is very unlikely that one person can embody both forms of bias.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Hostile <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> benevolent <b>sexism</b> {{are both}} related to gender inequality. This study {{was set up}} to examine if there is a {{relationship}} between the gender socialization received by parents and the development of sexism in Dutch young adults (N = 390, M = 21. 6, SD = 2. 19, 42. 6 % males), and whether this association is moderated by gender. Method: Data in this study is collected using an online survey named Love&Friends- 4 -Life. The survey measured sexism using the Gender Socialization Scale <b>and</b> the Ambivalent <b>Sexism</b> Inventory. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the possible relations between these variables. Results: First, the results suggested that a higher level of traditional gender socialization was related to a higher level of both hostile- <b>and</b> benevolent <b>sexism.</b> Second, the results suggested that a higher level of egalitarian gender socialization was related to a higher level of hostile sexism. Third, the results showed no relationship between egalitarian gender socialization <b>and</b> benevolent <b>sexism.</b> Finally, the results showed that none of the associations between traditional- or egalitarian gender socialization and hostile- or benevolent sexism were moderated by gender. Conclusion: The results found for traditional gender socialization were in agreement with the results from earlier research in children and adolescents. The results found for egalitarian gender socialization were inconsistent with the results from earlier research...|$|R

25|$|Though gender {{discrimination}} <b>and</b> <b>sexism</b> refer to beliefs and attitudes {{in relation to}} the gender of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. Sex discrimination, on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of prejudice and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.|$|E

García began speaking to women's groups in the area, and the Inez Garcia Defense Committee raised money for the defense and publicized the case, hoping to put gender inequalities {{in the criminal justice}} system, rather than Garcia herself, on trial. Through her contact with feminist groups, Garcia transformed from the timid, submissive victim who was too ashamed to even admit {{what had happened to her}} into an outspoken critic of patriarchy, even when she saw it in her own judge, who she accused of prejudice <b>and</b> <b>sexism.</b> During the trial, Garry had argued that García had acted with diminished capacity. He based this argument on expert psychological testimony that rape causes mental trauma and García's own history of mental instability. The defense disappointed feminists who preferred to see García as a symbol of strength and resistance to male domination. It also failed to win the sympathy of the jury. García was convicted of second-degree murder, sentenced, and spent two years in the California Institution for Women before her appeal was heard.|$|E

40|$|What is {{at stake}} for women who {{challenge}} sexism? In October 2012, Australia’s first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a speech in Parliament in which she accused the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, of <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> misogyny. The speech attracted local and international media coverage, and sparked widespread debate about precisely what constitutes <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> misogyny, and whether the accusation was justified. This study adopts a discursive psychological approach to analyse a corpus of 216 articles published in the Australian print media in the week following the speech. The analysis identifies common discursive patterns and resources used to construct <b>and</b> represent <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> examines {{the ways in which}} this accusation of sexism was dismissed, minimised and undermined. The analysis also demonstrates how Gillard’s identity was negatively constructed and problematized, and the implications this may have for other women who wish to confront sexism. Finally, the analysis suggests that silence is privileged over speaking up against <b>sexism,</b> <b>and</b> provides evidence for the existence of an ideological dilemma – in which speaking up against sexism is considered ‘‘dangerous’’, but failing to do so is to tolerate an injustice.
