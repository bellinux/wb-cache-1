25|$|Molly Weasley (née Prewett) {{is married}} to Arthur Weasley and mother of seven children, {{including}} Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry Potter's best friend. Molly is born into the pure-blood Prewett family, being the sister of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. The character is first introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she kindly tells Harry how to cross the barrier through to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is furious with Fred, George, and Ron after she discovers that they flew their parents' enchanted car to rescue Harry from his aunt and uncle who had imprisoned him in his room. At {{the beginning of the}} school year, Molly sends Ron a Howler, screaming at him in anger that he and Harry flew the family car again, this time to Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Weasleys win the Daily Prophet draw and use the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. They return to Britain and stay at the Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Hermione. Harry overhears Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing one night <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> Harry the truth about the supposed connection between Sirius Black and Harry; Arthur feels Harry should know the truth but Molly, feeling the truth would terrify him, assures him Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts with Dumbledore's protection, and orders Percy Weasley to keep an eye on Harry at the school.|$|E

Groves said that Oppenheimer's refusal to report Chevalier was [...] "the typical American school boy attitude {{that there is something}} wicked <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> on a friend." [...] Under questioning from Robb, Groves said that under the security criteria in effect in 1954, he [...] "would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today." ...|$|E
500|$|Gérard Depardieu as Jean Cadoret / [...] "Jean de Florette": Jean {{is a city}} {{man with}} a romantic idea of the countryside, yet obstinate and hard-working. Depardieu was well {{established}} as a versatile actor even before this role. Seemingly impervious to the great pressure on the film crew, he earned a reputation on the set for [...] "fooling <b>about,</b> <b>telling</b> jokes, swearing at planes interrupting the shot and never knowing his lines until the camera was rolling".|$|E

500|$|Probably in {{many respects}} most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an {{unconscious}} way. I don't really think <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, [...] "Oh, that's what I wrote that song about." [...] But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that'. In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness of people who have intimacy problems.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{cites the}} lyrics to the first bridge – [...] "But if I seem to act unkind / It's only me, it's not my mind / That is {{confusing}} things" [...] – {{as an example of}} Harrison applying an Eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication, by presenting them as [...] "contradictions between different levels of being". In Laing's interpretation, the entities [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] represent, respectively, [...] "individualistic, selfish ego" [...] and [...] "the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time". In I, Me, Mine, however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] should be reversed, since: [...] "The mind is the thing that hops <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> us to do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Michael Cragg {{described}} [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] as a [...] "Vanity 6-esque strut", and {{dubbed it}} and [...] "Do What U Want", [...] "futuristic, electro-tooled R slow jams with delicious choruses". Robbie Daw of Idolator called the [...] "not so subtle" [...] and [...] "randy" [...] song {{one of the}} album's [...] "standouts", and recommended it {{for use as a}} single. MTV's John Walker said of the song, [...] "There's something so goofily erotic <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> someone 'you were in my sex dreams.' It's such a cumbersome phrase, yet Gaga somehow makes {{it one of the most}} erotic lines you'll heard [...] all year. The half-giggled 'I really shouldn't be telling you this' line at the song's climax— no pun intended— really seals the deal." [...] Walker humorously rated the song 5 out of 5 [...] "vaguely vaginal Georgia O'Keeffe orchids".|$|E

500|$|Steph's early {{story lines}} were heavily {{focused on her}} school life. She was often seen {{bullying}} Lisa Hunter (Gemma Atkinson). Steph's cruelty reached extreme levels when she obtained evidence of Lisa's boyfriend, Brian Drake (Jonathan Le Billon) cheating on her. The evidence was projected on the school wall for all the students to discover; Lisa is heartbroken {{and ended up in}} hospital after self-harming herself. Steph was delighted <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> the other students that Lisa attempted suicide. Steph's friends felt she had finally gone too far with her bullying and they started to lose respect for her; eventually — Steph apologised for her behaviour and promised to change her attitude. Aware of her good looks, Steph enjoyed a reputation of being the school's [...] "good-time" [...] girl; during her school years, she had brief flings with Brian Drake and a footballer called Scott Anderson.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of being}} about Marty's love for Shiloh, {{most of the}} novel occurs in Marty's {{thoughts}} such as when he ponders <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> falsehoods to his parents. Because the book was considered [...] "very internal" [...] by the major film studios, director Dale Rosenbloom labored over making the film more external. Rosenbloom added new characters and scenes to the story and faxed each change to the novel's author. Naylor was neither fearful of Rosenbloom's changes nor unhesitant at suggesting changes. After the film was released, Naylor said that Rosenbloom [...] "did a very good job", and Rosenbloom said, [...] "We did do right by the book and her ... She lives by her code and if you honor it, she appreciates it." [...] By June 1997, Naylor had seen the film six times. In an interview that month, she noted that she was always struck by the hush of the theater and by how the film entrances everyone, even the children.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 4 October 2008 that Sam would depart from Holby City in [...] "a blaze of glory {{in a big}} Christmas storyline". A show insider revealed that [...] "Tom’s departure will leave his fans in tears, but Holby bosses are keeping tight-lipped {{about whether or not}} Sam will be killed off." [...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly nice about it. Sam Strachan has gone through so much in the past year with his cancer – it seemed like the perfect time to make the break." [...] Several episodes before the character's departure, his estranged son Kieron played by Misha Crosby, was introduced to Holby City. Father and son both developed romantic feelings for nurse Maria Kendall, leading to Sam asking her to accompany them both to New York, where Kieron was a famous violinist. After being shown her future should she accept, Maria declined Sam's offer, and he and Keiron departed together.|$|E

500|$|Leslie and Justin meet Frank, {{a strange}} and {{depressed}} man that has constant panic attacks. Leslie begins to have doubts about bringing him {{to her mother and}} tries to call it off, but Justin insists that they should [...] "let this unfold". At the dance, where Andy's (Chris Pratt) band Mouse Rat is playing, Frank meets up with Marlene, who is repulsed by Frank's past, current unemployment and overall failure at life. She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. Ron (Nick Offerman) explains that Justin is a [...] "tourist," [...] meaning that he takes [...] "vacations in people's lives" [...] and only cares <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist Duke Silver, but he denies it. Leslie later breaks up with Justin, which Tom (Aziz Ansari) takes especially hard, reacting as if his parents were getting divorced.|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon {{said that}} his {{previous}} television shows were based on ensembles, with S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{based in part on}} the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo". That episode highlighted a lesser seen character, which was something he wanted to achieve with the character of Agent Phil Coulson. It was written by Whedon, along with his brother Jed Whedon and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen. At the same time, he was writing the script for , which meant that he could use the series to explain the resurrection of Coulson rather than trying to include it in that film. Whedon revealed that he received notes from ABC on things to change in the pilot, but noted that the network was encouraging and excited about the project, so [...] "you take the notes. You don’t take all of them. But you never walk in expecting not to get any." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con 2013, Tancharoen talked <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> a Marvel story on a television budget, calling it a challenge but noting that the series is [...] "looking at it through a different lens", telling the human stories in the superhuman universe, with Coulson, who was the human, grounded character in the films, leading a team of 'real people', albeit extremely skilled people.|$|E
500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E

500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

Reyat was not shy <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> everyone he knew around Duncan about the need for revenge, or asking about explosives. Reyat sought cases of dynamite and did not care if he had to pay three times the normal price. He eventually confided it was not about stumps, but [...] "trouble in the old country", that he needed [...] "explosives to help my countrymen." [...] One friend declined to get him dynamite, but did lend him a 400-page manual on mining with explosives.|$|E

2500|$|Writer Mark Bowden {{argued that}} the film is neither pro- nor anti-torture: [...] "ure {{storytelling}} is not always about making an argument, no matter how worthy. It can be simply <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> the truth." [...] In an interview with Time magazine, Bigelow said: [...] "I'm proud of the movie, and I stand behind it completely. I think that it's a deeply moral movie that questions the use of force. It questions what {{was done in the}} name of finding bin Laden." [...] In a 2013 interview on The Colbert Report, Bigelow said the film showed many techniques of intelligence gathering used to find bin Laden, such as electronic surveillance, troops at the ground level, and [...] "good, old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground sleuthing".|$|E
2500|$|McGraw {{believed}} {{that he had to}} eliminate any potential distractions that could cause his teams to lose. [...] For example, Casey Stengel, who played for the Giants from 1921 to 1923, recalled that McGraw would go over the meal tickets at the team hotel, and wasn't shy <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> his players that they weren't eating right. [...] For most of his tenure, he set a curfew for 11:30 pm. [...] According to Rogers Hornsby, who served as a player-coach for the Giants in 1927, either McGraw or one of his coaches would knock on the players' hotel room doors at 11:30 sharp—and someone was expected to answer. [...] He was known to be extremely competitive; he would fine players for fraternizing with members of other teams and would not tolerate smiling in the dugout. [...] According to Bill James, with McGraw [...] "the rules were well understood." ...|$|E

He has often stated that the lack of musical Academy training was of course a disadvantage, but this was compensated by the advantage of being an actor who composes for fellow-actors and senses their need on the stage or on the screen: [...] "After all, if you had the right professors and they were good in a certain art (which was my case) they could teach you the rules of arts in a way to use them in another field of your muses. Because the rules of art are universal. For me there’s no difference if I play a character, compose music or write poetry for my songs, it’s all <b>about</b> <b>telling</b> stories, communication, sharing thoughts and emotions, about the ability to stretch and push the boundaries with visions of your own world".|$|E
