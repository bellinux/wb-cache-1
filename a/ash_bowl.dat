40|$|In {{the process}} of Producer Gas Production; clinker/ash {{is formed as a}} waste material. This clinker is removed by {{equipment}} named as <b>Ash</b> <b>Bowl</b> which rotates on the “Guide Roller” by the application of hydraulic pressure. This process having many problems like formation of large size clinker which require excess hydraulic pressure, guide roller is unable to scatter the hydraulic pressure equally in all the direction on the <b>ash</b> <b>bowl</b> to crush the clinker, more hydraulic pressure is required for the movement of the <b>ash</b> <b>bowl,</b> more time is required to replace the guide roller for its maintenance. In order to eliminate above mention problems, guide roller has been replaced by the thrust bearing which improves productivity by reducing break down time, reducing total man power required & reducing maintenance cost...|$|E
25|$|Thus England, who had {{expected}} to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia took a very quick wicket, that of Andrew Strauss, who was dismissed again by Shane Warne, caught bat-and-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's <b>Ashes</b> <b>bowling</b> record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play due to inadequate light. One additional session of play was however subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ash</b> burl <b>bowls,</b> {{especially}} Native American bowls, {{have been}} known to have been reshaped. A carver will take an antique burl bowl and modify the bowl in some way to make it more commercial, maybe by in-cutting handles or figures. A keen eye looks for proper proportions and appropriate wear.|$|R
500|$|The {{curator at}} Old Trafford {{had been ordered}} to prepare a dusty, {{spinning}} pitch for the Fourth Test. A win for England would see them retain the <b>Ashes.</b> Miller <b>bowled</b> 21 wicketless overs as England amassed 459. Miller was out for six and a duck and fell twice to Laker, who took a world record 19wickets as Australia lost by an innings. Wisden reported that the Australians were said [...] "to be extremely bitter over {{the condition of the}} pitch".|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} Mr. John Stumpy had puffed his pipe out, leaving the place filled with a heavy and vile smoke which gave me all I {{could do to keep}} from coughing. Then he slowly knocked the <b>ashes</b> from the <b>bowl</b> and {{restored}} the pipe to his pocket.|$|R

Thus encompassing the wide-ranging Civil Society groups in the village.|$|R

Outwardly quiet, all the time, it was only then that she became {{composed}} enough to light an enormous cigarette of the same pattern as those made specially for the king—por el Rey!

50|$|Upon excavation, one {{circular}} {{depression was}} found to be a nearly smooth, level, hard-packed floor. In the center of this structure was an upright, stone-slab fire basin, one side of which had been cut out; this was to allow room for the upright stone slab of a child’s grave. The child, thought to be about 12 years old, was found buried against the slab, with its head resting within the edges of the <b>bowl.</b> <b>Ashes</b> remained in the bowl and also along the back and top of the child’s head, although the bones do not appear to have been burned at all. Graves of two other children, whose stone box graves were also found in and below the floor.|$|R
5000|$|The term became further genericised in Australia in {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, and was used to {{describe}} many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of Australia vs England. The Australian rules football interstate carnival, and the small silver casket which served as its trophy, were symbolically known as [...] "the Ashes" [...] of Australian football, and was spoken of as such until at least the 1940s. The soccer rivalry between Australia and New Zealand was described as [...] "the soccer ashes of Australasia" [...] until as late as the 1950s; ashes from cigars smoked by the two countries' captains were put into a casket in 1923 to make the trophy literal. The interstate rugby league rivalry between Queensland and New South Wales was known for a time as Australia's rugby league <b>ashes,</b> and <b>bowls</b> competitions between the two states also regularly used the term. Even some local rivalries, such as southern Western Australia's annual Great Southern Football Carnival, were locally described as [...] "the ashes". This genericised usage is no longer common, and [...] "the Ashes" [...] would today be assumed only to apply to a contest between Australia and England.|$|R
2500|$|Harmison's success {{during his}} prime was {{attributed}} to his ability to extract bounce from any pitch – mainly due to his height being 6'4" [...] – {{and his ability to}} swing the ball while maintaining speeds of over 90mph. However, his lack of consistency often led to lethal spells being mixed up with equally bad bowling (a notable example is the opening ball of the 2006 <b>Ashes,</b> which he <b>bowled</b> straight to second slip, resulting in a wide that media commentators dubbed as [...] "the worst ball in history"). Nevertheless, his ability with the ball was never questioned; in 2007, former Australian cricketer Shane Warne named Harmison in his list of 50 greatest cricketers, stating: [...] "on his day, {{he is one of the}} most awkward bowlers [...] in the world".|$|R
500|$|Miller {{made his}} Ashes {{debut in the}} First Test in Brisbane. Bradman opted for six front-line bowlers, with Miller as high as number five in the batting order. Australia batted first, with Miller coming in at 3/322. He played aggressively to reach his fifty in just 80 minutes, {{striking}} a six onto {{the roof of the}} members' stand at long on, the biggest hit at the ground at the time, before being trapped leg before wicket by Doug Wright for 79 as Australia made 645. Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first <b>Ashes</b> wicket, <b>bowling</b> Hutton as England closed at 1/21. The following day, the pitch had turned into a sticky wicket following a heavy tropical storm. Miller bowled off breaks at medium pace and mixed in a large amount of bouncers. [...] On the unpredictable surface, Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body. Miller cut through the English top order, removing Edrich, Washbrook, Compton and Jack Ikin on the fourth morning, finishing with 7/60 as England made 141 and were forced to follow on. Miller took two wickets, including the dismissal of Hutton with first ball of the second innings as England fell to defeat by an innings and 334 runs and Miller had match figures of 9/77.|$|R
25|$|Twelve overs {{after lunch}} yielded three wickets and 20 runs. Vaughan, seeking centuries in {{successive}} Test matches {{for the first}} time since the 2002–03 <b>Ashes,</b> was clean <b>bowled</b> for 42 by Corey Collymore, Kevin Pietersen was caught by Bravo off Collymore, while Cook was bowled by debutant Darren Sammy. Paul Collingwood met with Ian Bell for the fifth-wicket partnership, though Bell was the dominant partner as the two made 32 in twelve overs before Taylor struck to leave England at 166 for five. However, the last five provided more than the top five, largely due to Ian Bell who made 97, three short of his seventh Test century, leaving him with a batting average of 84 batting at six in Test cricket. The tenth-wicket also did better than their batting averages would suggest, with Monty Panesar and Ryan Sidebottom both passing 14 in a 32-run partnership before Fidel Edwards bowled Panesar. Extras, with 47, was the third-highest scorer behind Bell and Cook.|$|R
500|$|Miller {{made his}} Ashes {{debut in the}} First Test in Brisbane {{the day after his}} 27th birthday. Miller was slated to bat at No. 5 and Bradman fielded six front-line bowlers, but this did not weaken the batting, as four of the bowlers, Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool and Ian Johnson, had all scored centuries in {{first-class}} cricket. Australia batted first but Miller was not needed until day two, coming in to join Hassett after Bradman was dismissed for 187 with the score at 3/322. Miller was asleep when Bradman fell, but roused himself and played aggressively to reach his half-century in just 80 minutes before lunch. He struck one six onto the roof of the members' stand at long-on, the biggest hit at the ground at the time. Miller's 106-run partnership with Hassett ended when Alec Bedser removed the latter caught at mid-on, having already been dropped four times. After the lunch break, Miller slowed down and was eventually trapped leg before wicket (lbw) by leg spinner Doug Wright, ending his first Ashes innings at 79, having taken 80 minutes to score his last 29 runs. During the course of his innings, which Australian cricket writer Johnnie Moyes described as [...] "attractive and stately", Miller passed 3,000 runs at first-class level. Australia reached 645 on the third day, a national record against England at home, before a tropical storm hit, complete with hailstones as large as golf balls. The tourists were very unaccustomed to such weather and were extremely disturbed by the noisy downpour. Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first <b>Ashes</b> wicket, <b>bowling</b> Hutton after testing him with a series of bouncers as England closed at 1/21.|$|R
5|$|Verity {{regained his}} place in the team for the third Test, {{replacing}} Bowes. The match was highly controversial owing to England's continued and increased use of Bodyline tactics. Verity's main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared partnerships worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45runs in the first innings and 40 in the second. He took one wicket in the game; after 16wicketless overs in the first innings, Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338runs. After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again. Rain before the beginning of the third day affected the pitch; Bradman, possibly irritated by a minor show of bravado from Verity, scored 71 in conditions which should have been perfect for the Yorkshireman, who took only two wickets. During the fourth Test, Verity took few wickets but Wisden noted that he kept a good length and prevented the Australian batsmen scoring quickly. His batting was important once more. In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76runs behind Australia's score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with tonsillitis. The two men scored 92runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 not out in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times. Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series—and the <b>Ashes.</b> Verity's <b>bowling</b> was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen's scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets. Having taken three for 62 in Australia's first innings, he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch that helped him to spin the ball. He dismissed Bradman for 71 and later took two wickets with successive deliveries.|$|R

40|$|Processing of {{wood waste}} for {{specialty}} wood products (souvenirs) {{are one of}} the few value-addition techniques in vertically integrated processing mills. Some wood conversion centres in Nigeria have not embraced further processing of wood waste because of affordability of the technology, cost and returns of processed wood waste. The economic returns on wooden souvenirs recovered from further processing of wood waste from furniture workshop were evaluated. Wood waste of four hardwood species namely Gmelina arborea (Gmelina), Mansonia altissima (Mansonia), Afzelia africana (Apa) and Tectona grandis (Teak) were processed to turned wooden souvenir products namely fruit <b>bowls,</b> <b>ash</b> trays, flower vase. Off-cut of wood strips in quartersawn orientation was glued side-by-side to form a laminated plank to prepare these faces for millwork turning using a Wadkin-Bursgreen lathe model machine. Data on production cost were collated for the various items produced. Parameters evaluated included Average Total Costs (ATC) per unit of turned wood laminate produced as main determinant of production cost, cash flow and Rate of Returns on Investment (RORI). The main determinants of production costs in the industry were glue and labour with values of 72. 7 % and 15. 8 % of the production cost respectively. The RORI was between ranges of 38. 9 % to 133. 3 %, while the benefit-cost ratio was 1. 90 : 1. Laminate is environment-friendly as it uses wood waste in construction and makes more efficient use of the left over wood in wood processing centers.
