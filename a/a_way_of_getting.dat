5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks of <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> her back in by digging a tunnel {{with the help of}} some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden.|$|E
25|$|Teachers can, however, accidentally promote {{cheating}} behavior. A {{study found}} {{a correlation between}} how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> back at the teacher. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a grade curve, {{are more likely to}} cheat.|$|E

Indeed, Salieri, {{who has been}} a devout Catholic all his life, cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> back at his Creator.|$|E
25|$|Fowler {{had worked}} so hard in {{developing}} his ideas that he had undermined his health. He was advised to take more rest and so he retired to Ackworth in Yorkshire, to recuperate. He was persuaded to take up hunting as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> exercise and whilst out with the hunt he had a fall and sustained a compound fracture of his arm. Whilst recovering from this mishap, he developed tetanus and died on 4 December 1864, at his home in Ackworth. He died only months after his great triumph at the Newcastle ploughing trial, at the age of only thirty-eight.|$|E
25|$|The first tableau {{shows the}} {{encounter}} of Fabrice and Clélia near an auberge {{on the mountain}} road to Milan. Fabrice, still a teenager, has fled the Grianta castle in a barouche {{with his mother and}} aunt, seeking safety in Milan. The carriage is stopped by police looking for a certain Conti travelling without a passport, who then appears, with his young and beautiful daughter Clélia. The Général Conti is escorted to Milan while Fabrice offers a seat in the barouche to Clélia. The second tableau takes place in the box of Gina at La Scala, where she receives Milanese liberals trying with her to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> Fabrice from arrest by Austrian police, then her lover Mosca, Conti and Clélia and finally Fabrice to whom she explains the plan to help him. By the end of the act, the feelings of Fabrice and Clélia are clear although Gina's towards Fabrice are less so.|$|E

25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> {{around the}} Government Order, the Boy Scouts of Bengal was founded, with {{identical}} aims and methods. Many separate Scout organizations began to spring up, the Indian Boy Scouts Association, founded in 1916, based in Madras and headed by Annie Besant and George Arundale; Boy Scouts of Mysore; Boy Scouts of Baroda; Nizam's Scouts in Hyderabad; Seva Samiti Scout Association (Humanity Uplift Service Society), founded in 1917 by Madan Mohan Malaviya and Hridayanath Kunzru and based in Allahabad; the aforementioned Boy Scouts of Bengal and likely others. A conference {{was held in}} Calcutta in August 1920 in which Wilson staged a Scout Rally, {{and as a result}} the Viceroy of India sent an invitation to Lord Baden-Powell, by then Chief Scout of the World, to visit India. Lord and Lady Baden-Powell arrived in Bombay in late January 1921 for a short tour of the subcontinent before leaving Calcutta for Rangoon. Alfred Pickford accompanied them and became one of their closest friends.|$|E
25|$|Later it was {{discussed}} that a separate branch should {{be created in}} order to handle everything pertaining to the anti-Castro movement. The White House division organized Branch 4 (WH/4)as the new task force to run Cuban Operations. The task force included 40 personnel, with 18 at headquarters, 20 at the Havana station, and 2 at Santiago base. The state department was concerned that if Castro was overthrown then the people to come after him would be worse than him. These people were Che Guevara and Raul Castro. So they proposed <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> a better leader that they approved of in his place. The CIA began to worry that their involvement with the anti-Castro movement would lead to an anti-US movement. On March 14 of 1960, Dulles presented a “General Covert Action Plan for Cuba” that would focus only on the Cuban problems. Guerrilla capacity in the anti-Castro groups {{both in and out}} of Cuba {{was discussed}}.|$|E
25|$|Alan and Dale Klapmeier {{grew up in}} DeKalb, Illinois. Their parents {{bought a}} second home in the early 1970s on a small farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin. Aviation {{was a part of}} the {{brothers}}' lives from a very early age; Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that when he was a baby, the only way his mother could get him to stop crying at times was to bring him to an airport and park the car at the end of the runway so he could watch airplanes. The brothers constantly built model airplanes as infants and Dale was known to repeatedly pester their father into letting them build real ones. When Dale reached the age of 15, he learned to fly in a Cessna 140 before learning to drive a car. While still in high school, Alan joined the Civil Air Patrol at age 17 as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> cheaper flying lessons. He would often go around visiting small airports to talk to pilots and even told his friends that he wanted to design aircraft, speaking about how he and his younger brother would one day compete with Cessna.|$|E

30|$|<b>A</b> <b>way</b> for {{principals}} {{to become}} more involved in teacher learning through the Learning Dialogues was to participate in them, which significantly all did.

500|$|Harrison's guitar {{work with}} the Beatles was varied and flexible; {{although}} not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the Rubber Soul album and [...] "Here Comes the Sun", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was [...] "clearly an innovator" [...] as he was [...] "taking certain elements of R and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique". Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as [...] "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely {{in the service of}} the song". Harrison's friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed: [...] "He just had <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> right to the business, of finding the right thing to play."

Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives.
