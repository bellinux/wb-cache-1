The elder architect invited Tange to attend the Congres International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). Founded in 1928 this organization of planners and architects had initially promoted architecture in economic and social context, but at its fourth meeting in 1933 (under the direction of Le Corbusier) it debated {{the notion of the}} [...] "Functional City". This led to a series of proposals on urban planning known as [...] "The Athens Charter". By the 1951 CIAM meeting that was held in Hoddesdon, England, to which Tange was invited, the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> came under debate by younger members of the group (including Tange) who found the Charter too vague in relation to city expansion. The [...] "Athens Charter" [...] promoted the idea that a city gains character from its continual changes over many years; this notion was written before the advent of mass bombings and the Second World War and therefore held little meaning for Tange who had evidenced the destruction of Hiroshima. The discussions at Hoddesdon sowed discontent within CIAM that eventually contributed to its breakup after their Dubrovnik meeting in 1956; the younger members of CIAM formed a splinter group known as Team X, which Tange later joined. Tange presented various designs to Team X in their meetings. [...] At a 1959 meeting in Otterlo, Holland, one of his presentations included an unrealised project by Kiyonori Kikutake; this project became the basis of the Metabolist Movement.|$|E

50|$|The {{text of the}} <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> as {{published}} {{became an}} extension of the content of The Radiant City and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original observations. As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the observations that were founded before on concrete references. Despite its title, the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns.|$|E

50|$|Salingaros {{contributed to}} the New <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> of 2003, which is meant to replace the {{original}} 1933 <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> written principally by the highly influential modernist architect-planner Le Corbusier. That blueprint segregated urban functions and contributed to generating post-war urban typologies such as monoculture and sprawl. Through this and other writings Salingaros sought to retrofit suburbia, and reconnect US and European cities at the human scale. This work {{can be seen as}} allied with the New Urbanism movement to replace sprawling development with compact, walkable cities and towns.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> had a {{huge impact}} on {{planning}} thought after World War II. However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the Charter with a different Charter of Habitat.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the thirties}} Le Corbusier spread {{the message of}} his new, ideal city.

50|$|The <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> (Charte d'Athènes) was a {{document}} about urban planning {{published by the}} Swiss architect, Le Corbusier in 1943.

50|$|The <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} a common world heritage, the importance of the setting of monuments, and the principle of the integration of new materials. The Charter had very progressive suggestions for its period, influencing the creation of conservation institutions, as well as the eventual Venice Charter.|$|E
50|$|Where Molenbeek {{was once}} a centre of intense {{industrial}} activity, concentrated around the canal and the railway, most of those industries have disappeared {{to make way for}} large-scale urban renewal following the modernist <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter.</b> The industrial past is remembered in a museum of social and industrial history built {{on the site of the}} foundry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of new conservation and restoration techniques have threatened the historic buildings in a general sense. In 1931, the International Museum Office organized a meeting of specialists about the conservation of historic buildings.

50|$|In its {{approach}} to Narmak’s planning, the AIAD {{was inspired by the}} philosophy of Le Corbusier set out in “The Functional City” and the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> of 1943. The charter explained the necessary town conditions of Dwellings, Recreation, Working, and Transportation, which highlighted the advantages of collective organization. To implement modernist principles and prior to planning for the new district, AIAD visited Chandigarh for inspiration. Chandigarh represented what they were aiming for, a successful application of modernist principles on a newly developed town.|$|E
50|$|She {{has been}} {{inspired}} by the theories of French architect and urban planner Jean Renaudie, {{as well as the}} way that towns were planned in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Baroque period. Buczkowska is opposed to the segregation imposed by urban zoning and to the functional urban layout proposed by the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter.</b> She was innovative in her use of wood as a building material and advocates the use of free plan construction which facilitates movement through the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea behind}} ICOMOS {{dates to the}} Athens Conference on the {{restoration}} of historic buildings in 1931, organized by the International Museums Office. The <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter</b> of 1931 introduced the concept of international heritage. In 1964, the Second Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, meeting in Venice, adopted 13 resolutions. The first created the International Charter on the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, better known as Venice Charter; the second, put forward by UNESCO, created ICOMOS {{to carry out this}} charter.|$|E
50|$|In 1933 the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter,</b> a {{manifesto}} of the modernist movement, was signed, and was published later by Le Corbusier. Architects {{of this movement}} were among others: the Bauhaus-architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, Dimitris Pikionis, Patroklos Karantinos and Takis Zenetos. After World War II and the Greek civil war, the massive construction of condominiums in the major Greek city centres, was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first skyscrapers were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the OTE Tower and the Athens Tower Complex.|$|E
5000|$|The {{architecture}} {{was largely}} responsible for this slow, irreversible decline. The neighborhood had been designed according to a utopian vision particular to France: in the 1960s and 1970s, urban planners believed that functional areas, such as shops and living spaces, should be elevated and separated from the traffic. This functionalism also lay behind the design of La Défense, La Part Dieu in Lyon and other new towns, and {{was based on the}} sanitary principles laid out in the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter.</b> “France, being absolutist and excessively theoretical, was the only country to apply this new type of urban planning concept to the letter,” notes Denis Valode.|$|E
5000|$|The Italie 13 {{project was}} one of the answers {{proposed}} by urbanists to the insalubrity of some areas of the city, mainly the 13th arrondissement which was generally considered to be [...] "badly built". Raymond Lopez, the advising architect at the Paris city hall, and his assistant Michel Holley, considered this renovation to be an opportunity to completely reorganize those areas, {{in the spirit of the}} <b>Athens</b> <b>charter</b> and Le Corbusier. This meant that new construction should be tall in order to liberate more space at the ground level and to bring a better luminosity to apartments, and separating heavily traveled roads from smaller local roads and pedestrian areas. Other principles from Le Corbusier, such as surrounding towers with parks were, however, put aside.|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberbürgermesiter of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter.</b> Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstraße 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, modernism {{had become an}} {{important}} movement in Europe. Architecture, which previously had been predominantly national, began to become international. The architects traveled, met each other, and shared ideas. Several modernists, including Le Corbusier, {{had participated in the}} competition for the headquarters of the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the Weissenhof Estate Stuttgart. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; Le Corbusier, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style. The first meeting of the Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chateau on Lake Leman in Switzerland June 26-28, 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Auguste Perret, Pierre Chareau and Tony Garnier from France; Victor Bourgeois from Belgium; Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn, Ernst May and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from Germany; Josef Frank from Austria; Mart Stam and Gerrit Rietveld from the Netherlands, and Adolf Loos from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included Josep Lluís Sert of Spain and Alvar Aalto of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic [...] "Rational methods for groups of habitations". A third meeting, on [...] "The functional city", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized. The text, called The <b>Athens</b> <b>Charter,</b> after considerable editing by Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.|$|E
