5000|$|In Morris v Murray (1990) 3 AER 801 the {{claimant}} helped an obviously drunken pilot {{get into a}} small aeroplane, which crashed as it attempted to take off. This was a classic case for volenti to apply. The court held that {{the claimant}} must have known the condition of the pilot and voluntarily took the risk of negligence by agreeing to be a passenger. However, in driving cases, s149 Road Traffic Act 1988 denies the effectiveness of any agreement between a passenger of a motor vehicle and the driver that seeks to <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> for negligence where insurance cover for passengers is compulsory. This applies both to express agreements between driver and passenger (e.g. where the driver displays a notice in the vehicle stating that passengers travel at their own risk) and to implied agreements in cases such as Pitts v Hunt (1991) 1 QB 24, where the claimant was a passenger on a motor cycle knowing that the driver was drunk, uninsured, and without a current licence. The defendant negligently collided with another vehicle, killing himself and injuring the passenger. Dillon LJ. dismissed the claim on the ground of ex turpi causa because there was a joint common purpose. This is a public policy test of [...] "public conscience" [...] because the claimant might otherwise benefit from the unlawful behaviour willingly undertaken. Similarly, under ss1 and 2 Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, commercial <b>agreements</b> seeking to <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> in negligence are also void. But if the claimant signs an express agreement identifying the nature of the risks likely to be run and accepting those risks, this is evidence that the claimant is volens and has chosen to run the risk not by compulsion or as the lesser of two or more evils i.e. the contractual clause is an express volenti exclusion clause for the purposes of tortious liability. Because knowledge of a risk does not of itself imply consent, the UCTA prevails and such clauses do not automatically <b>exclude</b> <b>liability.</b> This would particularly apply in medical cases where informed consent is traditionally evidenced in a written form (Luckham: 2004).|$|R

2500|$|Attempts by {{contracting}} parties to <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> for misrepresentations {{are subject to}} the same restrictions as are found for exclusion clauses generally under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

But it is possible to <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> for negligent misrepresentation, liability under Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) or innocent misrepresentation. The requirement, however, is that the exclusion is [...] "reasonable" [...] according to UCTA 1977 s 11, in conjunction with Sch 2.|$|R

Before CRA it was treated differently; in Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [...] 1 QB 409 the Court of Appeal held that an occupier could <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> by displaying a notice disclaiming as such, even if the claimant had not read the notice.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is {{allowable}} risk {{and its impact}} as a potential circumstance <b>excluding</b> <b>liability.</b> Czech law system takes into account tolerable risk as a circumstance <b>excluding</b> <b>liability</b> which this thesis is substantially focused on. At {{the beginning of the}} thesis circumstances <b>excluding</b> <b>liability</b> are defined in order to compare specifics of the tolerable risk institute. Briefly it analyzes some basic criminal law questions related to the thesis subject including concept of crime or errors in circumstances <b>excluding</b> <b>liability.</b> Next chapters deal with legal and general definition of tolerable risk and historical development of this issue in our law environment, including work of August Miřička, probably the first Czech lawyer addressing this issue. Further questions are suggested in these chapters. These questions are derived from legal status of tolerable risk and are thoroughly discussed in separate chapters for each sector. Legislator did not restrict sectors of usage explicitly. If conditions stated in the criminal code are fulfilled, tolerable risk can be always used. Although the thesis focuses on sectors in which risk has been proven usable, potential list of fields of application is not totally exhausting.

50|$|Although it {{is clearly}} {{established}} a clause seeking to <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> for fraud is invalid, yet <b>liability</b> may be <b>excluded</b> for employees’ dishonest conduct if their employer does not profit from it, and even for a party’s own “wilful default.” A party can be exempted from liability not only for negligence but, as per Afrox, also for gross negligence. In Government of the Republic of South Africa v Fibrespinners & Weavers the Appellate Division gave effect to a clause exempting an employer from liability for theft by its employee. More recently, FNB v Rosenblum confirmed this approach. Where one exempts oneself from negligence, however, one should do so explicitly. In cases of ambiguity, the clause is interpreted not to <b>exclude</b> <b>liability</b> for negligence.|$|R
