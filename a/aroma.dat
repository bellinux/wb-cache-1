50|$|<b>Aromas</b> is a commune in the Jura {{department}} {{in the region of}} Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France. On 1 January 2017, the former commune of Villeneuve-lès-Charnod was merged into <b>Aromas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Aromas</b> {{present in}} a good vintage Château-Grillet is {{typically}} apricot, truffle, and honey on the nose, and apricot, orange and tangerine on the palate. More floral <b>aromas</b> are present on the nose with some aging, typically eight years or more. The fruit <b>aromas</b> associated with Château-Grillet are therefore somewhat different than from those typically found in Condrieu, where pear is often found.|$|R

5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in <b>aroma</b> as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the <b>aroma</b> pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta con funghi is an aquacotta soup {{variation}} {{that uses}} porcini mushrooms {{as a primary}} ingredient. Additional ingredients include bread, stock or water, tomato conserva, Parmesan cheese, eggs, mentuccia, wild mint, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. This variation's flavor and <b>aroma</b> {{has been described as}} based upon the porcini mushrooms that are used; parsley may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom <b>aroma</b> and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
50|$|Canard-Duchêne Authentic Brut is characterised by its straw-yellow {{appearance}} and delicate mousse.

5|$|Lambic, a beer of Belgium, is {{naturally}} fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many {{of these are}} not strains of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in <b>aroma</b> and sourness. Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in a {{fermentation}} process to make yoghurt, cheese, curd, kefir, ayran, xynogala, {{and other types of}} food. Fermentation cultures provide flavor and <b>aroma,</b> and inhibit undesirable organisms. They are used to leaven bread, and to convert sugars to alcohol in wine and beer. Microorganisms {{are used in}} brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and other food-making processes.|$|E
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the <b>aroma</b> as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E

5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and <b>aroma.</b> Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom <b>aroma</b> and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated ether {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity <b>aroma.</b> It is miscible with ethanol, acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aroma</b> {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate from the blue Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E
40|$|Breeding {{different}} strawberry genotypes {{and plant}} selection in Brazil {{could result in}} new cultivars with better environmental adaptations. The aim was to develop and select new F 1 strawberry plants with higher potential yields. Twelve hybrid populations were obtained from breeding the cultivars <b>Aromas,</b> Camarosa, Dover, Festival, Oso Grande, Sweet Charlie and Tudla, and 42 F 1 hybrids were obtained from each population. An augmented randomized block design was used. Productive traits were measured and heterosis was calculated for all traits. The breedings Dover x <b>Aromas</b> and Camarosa x <b>Aromas</b> both showed 28. 6 % of their hybrids with a total fruit mass that was {{higher than that of}} cv. <b>Aromas,</b> and 9. 5 and 14. 3 % were higher than that of cv. Camarosa, respectively. The breeding of Camarosa x <b>Aromas</b> produced hybrids with high potential yields and a large average fruit mass that reached the commercial standard. Hybrids MCA 12 - 93, MFA 12 - 443 and MCA 12 - 89 showed high potential yields and can be used as parents in strawberry breeding programs. ...|$|R

5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and <b>aroma,</b> inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and <b>aroma</b> as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering <b>aroma.</b> A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
