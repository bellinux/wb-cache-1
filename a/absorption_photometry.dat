40|$|Because of the {{importance}} of HONO as a radical reservoir, consistent and accurate measurements of its concentration are needed. As part of SHARP (Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors), time series of HONO were obtained by six different measurement techniques {{on the roof of the}} Moody Tower at the University of Houston. Techniques used were long path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), stripping coil-visible <b>absorption</b> <b>photometry</b> (SC-AP), long path <b>absorption</b> <b>photometry</b> (LOPAP®), mist chamber/ion chromatography (MC-IC), quantum cascade-tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectroscopy (QC-TILDAS), and ion drift-chemical ionization mass spectrometry (ID-CIMS). Various combinations of techniques were in operation from 15 April through 31 May 2009. All instruments recorded a similar diurnal pattern of HONO concentrations with higher median and mean values during the night than during the day. Highest values were observed in the final 2 weeks of the campaign. Inlets for the MC-IC, SC-AP, and QC-TILDAS were collocated and agreed most closely with each other based on several measures. Largest differences between pairs of measurements were evident during the day for concentrations ~ 100 parts per trillion (ppt). Above ~ 200 ppt, concentrations from the SC-AP, MC-IC, and QC-TILDAS converged to within about 20 %, with slightly larger discrepancies when DOAS was considered. During the first 2 weeks, HONO measured by ID-CIMS agreed with these techniques, but ID-CIMS reported higher values during the afternoon and evening of the final 4 weeks, possibly from interference from unknown sources. A number of factors, including building related sources, likely affected measured concentrations...|$|E

The classification using the M4AST online tool says this is an L-type asteroid those peculiar asteroids are characterized by a strongly reddish spectrum shortward of 0.8 μm, and a featureless flat spectrum longward of this, with little or no concave-up curvature related to a 1 μm silicon <b>absorption</b> band.Time-series <b>photometry</b> was also obtained in the Observatorio de La Hita (I95) and Observatorio de Sierra Nevada during two consecutive nights (15-16 February 2013). All of this data were co-phased to build a light curve of the object. This light-curve is double-peak and presents large variations in magnitude, implying a very elongated object, which is compatible with radar observations. The amplitude of the light-curve yields an axial ratio that, together with the long axis of 40 m inferred from the radar images by Goldstone, results in an equivalent diameter of 18 m, much smaller than the estimations before the close-approach.|$|R

40|$|In a {{comparative}} study of urinary calcium methods, many of the recently proposed procedures proved either impractical or invalidin our hands. A preliminary isolation of the calcium as the oxalate, followed by perchloric acid oxidation of the oxalate {{seemed to be the}} simplest procedure whereby urinary calcium could be put in a state suitable for chelometric titration. The isolated calcium could also be titrated with considerable precision and accuracy by a modified procedure with a derivative automatic titrator which is available commercially. It was suggested from our observations that too little attention has been directed towards the problems imposed by the occurrence of calcium precipitates in urine. An untreated 24 -hr. urine specimen is not suitable for direct analysis of calcium by chelometric titration, by colorimetric analysis, by emission flame photometry, or by atomic <b>absorption</b> flame <b>photometry</b> because these methods do not give a true meas-ure of the calcium in the precipitate. Boiling for 5 mm. with 1 part concentrated nitric acid to 25 parts urine proved a suitable means for completely dissolving the calcium precipitate. U RINARY CALCIUM DETERMINATIONS probably rate among the lowest in accuracy in the average clinical laboratory. The older methods are tedious and require considerable analytical skill, and some of the re-ceutly proposed procedures do not give a valid measure.

The results support for an intercalative {{interaction of}} both ZnL 2 + and CuL 2 + with DNA, showing CuL 2 + an affinity of approximately 10 times higher than ZnL 2 +. In particular, the values of the binding constant, determined by UV spectrophotometric titration, equal to 7. 3 x 10 (4) and 1. 3 x 10 (6) M- 1. for ZnL 2 + and CuL 2 +, respectively, indicate the occurrence of a marked interaction with a binding size of about 0. 7 in base pairs. The temperature dependence of the absorbance at 258 nm suggests that both complexes strongly increase the DNA melting temperature (Tm) already at metal complex-DNA molar ratios equal to 0. 1. As evidenced by the quenching of the fluorescence of ethidium bromide-DNA solutions in the presence of increasing amounts of metal complex, ZnL 2 + and CuL 2 + are able to displace the ethidium cation intercalated into DNA. A tight ZnL 2 +-DNA and CuL 2 +-DNA binding has been also proven by the appearance, in both metal complex-DNA solutions, of a broad induced CD band in the range 350 - 450 nm. In the case of the CuL 2 +-DNA system, the shape of the CD spectrum, at high CuL 2 + content, is similar to that observed for psi-DNA solutions.

Material and Methods: Wild shrimps from different areas of the province and also three types of farmed shrimps including Ferropenaeus, penaeus semisulcatus and Litopenaeusvannamei were caught and collected. Then cleaned, washed, dried and made into powder and then made into ash in a furnace at 550 °C. Heavy metals including Pb, Cd, Hg, Cu, and Zn were measured by atomic <b>absorption</b> flame <b>photometry.</b> Results: The mean values of the concentration of the heavy metals including Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu present in the wild shrimps were, 2. 86, 9. 53, 0. 45, 1. 36 ppm respectively. The amount of Hg found to be 2. 8 ppb. Also the mean values of the concentration of the heavy metals in the farmed shrimps were measured as 3, 9. 8, 0. 42 and 1. 37 ppm respectively and the amount of Hg was 2. 7 ppb. There was no difference between the amount of heavy metals estimated in the tissues from wild shrimps and the farmed one. Conclusion: The results of this investigation showed that the concentration of heavy metals including Zn,Cu and Hg in both types of the shrimps were less than the amounts reported by WHO and so not risky for health. However the concentration of Pb and Cd in both types were more than the recommended consumption limit for the humans, and they can be considered as risk factors for many diseases.

Within the limits of concentration studied, it was observed that calcium determination was affected by the ions Fe 3 +, Al 3 +, Mn 2 +, Si 4 +, PO 3 - 4 and SO 2 - 4. The ions Mg 2 +, K+, Na+, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, CI-, NO- 3 and ClO- 4 had no interference. Magnesium determination was affected only by the presence of the ions Al 3 + and Si 4 +.

A portion (2 to 10 ml) was transfered to a 50 ml volumetric flask, lanthanum was added to a final concentration of 0. 1 % and the volume was taken to 50 ml. Calcium and magnesium in plant material were determined using calibration curves, obtained with calcium solutions varying from 0 to 10 ppm and magnesium solutions varying from 0 to 2 ppm (both had 0. 1 % lanthanum). The method here described yields good accuracy and precision, and seems to be suitable for routine analysis of plant material...|$|R
40|$|Background : Apples {{have been}} known as nutritious and natural medicines. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{determine}} the amounts of nutrients compounds of golden and red delicious apples produced in Lorestan, Iran. Materials and Methods: Apple cultivars were harvested from different locations throughout Lorestan province in September 2008. The samples were dried at 80 º C for two days. The dry materials were grounded to analyse the elements. Phosphorous calcium, iron, and zinc and sodium and potassium were measured by spectrometry, atomic <b>absorption</b> and flame <b>photometry,</b> respectively. Other measured factors were energy, protein, carbohydrate, water, ash, and fiber. Results: The amounts of water, soluble solid products, ash, and fiber in red apples varieties were 78, 17. 9, 1. 44, and 0. 72 percent, respectively. These values for golden delicious apples were 77, 16, 1. 42, and 0. 72 percent, respectively. Energy, sugars, and protein contents of red delicious apples were 73 calories, 18, and 0. 27 g/ 100, respectively. These amounts for golden varieties were 83 calories, 20. 6, and 0. 2 g/ 100, respectively. K, Ca, P, Na, Fe, and Zn contents of red delicious apples were 63. 8, 27. 6, 9, 4. 8, 0. 24, and 0. 14 mg/ 100, respectively. These values for golden delicious variety were 66. 3, 27. 7, 8. 8, 4. 5, 0. 23, and 0. 14 mg/ 100, respectively. Conclusion: Energy, carbohydrates, and calcium contents of apples varieties produced in Lorestan province were more than their contents in Iranian Food Composition Tables. However, their iron contents were less than it...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} which determines the aerosol light absorption from the simultaneous measurement of radiation passing through and scattered {{back from a}} particle-loaded fibre filter. The measurement is performed at three detection angles to resolve the influence of light scattering aerosol components on the angular distribution of the back scattered radiation. The fraction of light absorbed by the deposited aerosol (absorbance ABS) is obtained from a radiative transfer scheme. The method response normalised to the mass concentration of black carbon to test aerosols with mass fractions of the light-absorbing component between 1. 2 % and 100 % (aerosol single scattering albedo 1. 0 - 0. 28) varied by > 300 % for a transmission measurement only, but by < 50 % for multi-angle <b>absorption</b> <b>photometry.</b> The compensation of light scattering effects in filter-based aerosol absorption measurements is considerably improved. The detection limit is 3. 5 x 10 "-" 4 absorbance units. The uncertainty of the absorbance is #+-# 12 %. The evaluation of the method using field data yielded an average mass specific absorption coefficient of 9. 1 - 10. 7 m" 2 g"-" 1 at #lambda# = 0. 55 #mu#m for atmospheric black carbon in urban air.

Diabetes is a disease of disquiet evolving {{as one of the}} major health care epidemics of contemporary era. Hence Painless control of blood glucose levels would improve the quality of life, propounding better ruling of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia thereby avoiding the complications of present day lancet methods. Although many efforts have been taken by researchers in order to successfully launch a device that measures blood glucose noninvasively, the results seems to be intruded due to mismatch in correlation with the present day devices. This is so because the Non-invasive device designers mostly concentrate on optical methods which suffer from greater interferences due to the less absorbing property of glucose. Aim of the paper is to draw together two different optical techniques namely <b>Absorption</b> <b>photometry</b> and photo acoustics using embedded technology, so that the results obtained produce better correlation after data handling with artificial neural network. Baseline pre-processing is used which will eliminate the errors due to instrument handling and temperature instability. Results obtained shows acceptable precision but in order to get satisfactory standards, Non-invasive glucose monitoring requires further efforts...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} four decades, various {{techniques}} including spectroscopic, wet chemical and mass spectrometric methods, have been developed and applied {{for the detection of}} ambient nitrous acid (HONO). We developed a HONO detection system based on long path photometry which consists of three independent modules i. e., sampling module, fluid propulsion module and detection module. In the propulsion module, solenoid pumps are applied. With solenoid pumps the pulsed flow can be computer controlled both in terms of pump stroke volume and pulse frequency, which enables the attainment of a very stable flow rate. In the detection module, a customized Liquid Waveguide Capillary Cell (LWCC) is used. The customized LWCC pre-sets the optical fiber in-coupling with the liquid wave guide, providing the option of fast startup and easy maintenance of the <b>absorption</b> <b>photometry.</b> In summer 2014, our system was deployed in a comprehensive campaign at a rural site in the North China Plain. More than one month of high quality HONO data spanning from the limit of detection to 5 ppb were collected. Intercomparison of our system with another established system from Forschungszentrum Juelich is presented and discussed. In conclusion, our instrument achieved a detection limit of 10 pptV within 2 min and a measurement uncertainty of 7 %, which is well suited for investigation of the HONO budget from urban to rural conditions in China...|$|E
40|$|Context. The {{detailed}} spiral {{structure in}} the outer Galactic disk is still poorly known, and for several Galactic directions {{we still have to}} rely on model extrapolations. Aims. One of these regions is the fourth Galactic quadrant, in the sector comprised between Vela and Carina (270 o ≤ l≤ 300 o) where-apart from the conspicuous Carina branch of the Carina Sagittarius arm- no spiral arms have been detected so far in the optical beyond l∼ 270 o. Methods. By means of deep UBVI photometry, we search for spiral features in known low <b>absorption</b> windows. U <b>photometry,</b> although observationally demanding, constitutes a powerful tool to detect and characterize distant aggregates of young stars, and allows to derive firmer distance estimates. We have studied a direction close to the tangent (l∼ 290 o) to the Carina arm, in an attempt to detect optical spiral tracers far beyond the Carina branch, where radio observations and models predictions seem to indicate the presence of the extension of the Perseus and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms in the fourth quadrant. Results. Along this line of sight, we detect three distinct groups of young stars. Two of them, at distances of∼ 2. 5 and∼ 6. 0 kpc, belong to the Carina spiral arm (which is crossed twice in this particular direction). Interestingly, the latter is here detected for the first time. The third group, at a distance of∼ 12. 7 kpc, is likely a part of the Perseus arm which lies beyond the Carina arm, and constitutes the first optical detection of this arm in the fourth Galactic quadrant. The position of this feature is compatible both wit...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The stellar contents of two regions on the peculiar galaxy M 82 are investigated by spectral synthesis. One of the regions {{is identified as}} {{the nucleus of the}} galaxy {{on the basis of its}} surface brightness and inferred mass density; the other is spectrally representative of the disk of M 82. Narrow-band spectrophotometry for both regions can be satisfactorily interpreted in terms of ordinary kinds of stars and dust prevalent in the solar neighborhood if [ [...] . ] of dust is mixed with the stars in the nucleus. There is no evidence for stellar abundance anomalies or the presence of significant amounts of non-stellar radiation except for gaseous emission between 3400 and 11000 [ [...] . ]. Approximately 50 % of the observed Na I [ [...] . ] 5892 absorption feature originates in the interstellar medium of M 82. The deduced main sequence luminosity functions for both regions resemble that for the galactic disk in the solar vicinity except that an excess of massive stars (M[ [...] . ] < - 3) exists in the nucleus and a deficiency, in the disk. Sufficient numbers of hot stars are present in the nucleus to maintain the observed level of nuclear interstellar ionization. The absence of massive stars in the disk is corroborated by photographic and spectroscopic evidence and may be the result of a suppression of star formation by a nuclear disturbance. The mass density inferred from the synthesis for the small disk region observed is much higher than found in typical late-type galaxies. The results of extensive <b>absorption</b> feature index <b>photometry</b> of common galactic stars are also described...|$|R
