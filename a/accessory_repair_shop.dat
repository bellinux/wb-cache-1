40|$|Within this report, a {{framework}} for the identification of performance bottlenecks within Component Services, KLM Engineering & Maintenance is developed. The proposed framework is developed {{through a combination of}} the essential process management cycle and process analysis, intertwined with the Theory of Constraints, based on the OPDCA (observe, plan, do, check, act) cycle of ongoing improvement. A series of steps are defined by the presented framework, including understand current condition, understand source of information gap, develop intervention plan, check results and fix the identified problem through implementing the intervention plan. The implementation of the presented framework in Avionics & <b>Accessories</b> (A&A) <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> and moreover, the performance analysis of the repair turnaround time metric revealed a performance constraint. Therefore, a set of solutions for the elimination of it has been developed and proposed. The intervention plan which includes setting a fix monthly number of actuator repairs (DBR), a priority rule for actuator repairs and implementing payment and incentive models for the production increase has been suggested. Recommendations that can facilitate in the implementation of the intervention plan together with some additional suggestions regarding the inventory management through the redefinition of the relation between the warehouse/pool and the <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> have been provided.

At these local <b>repair</b> <b>shops,</b> customers arrive with broken, but repairable, items. Customers go to the nearest open <b>repair</b> <b>shop.</b> Since they want to leave as soon as possible, an inventory of working items is kept at the <b>repair</b> <b>shops.</b> A customer immediately receives a working item from stock, provided that the stock is not empty. If a stockout occurs, the customer has to wait for a working item. The broken items are <b>repaired</b> in the <b>shop</b> and then put in stock. Sometimes, however, a broken item cannot be fixed at the local <b>repair</b> <b>shop,</b> {{and it has to be}} sent to a central <b>repair</b> <b>shop.</b> At the central <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> the same policy with inventory and repair is used.
