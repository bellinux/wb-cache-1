At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy <b>antenna</b> <b>array</b> emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} entire system. The same <b>antenna</b> <b>array</b> can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mutual {{coupling}} is {{a common}} problem in the applications of <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays.</b> It significantly affects the operation of almost all types of <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays.</b> Over the past years, {{there have been many}} different kinds of methods suggested to decouple (or to compensate for) the mutual coupling effect in <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays.</b> The effectiveness of these methods varied and depended upon the types of <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> being considered and the applications in which the <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> were used. In this paper, a brief review of the decoupling methods for the mutual coupling effect in <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> is presented. These include patented and non-patented methods. The methods are grouped under seven categories for <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> in communications and four categories for <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The various methods will be first briefly described and their operation principles will be explained. Then some comments on their scopes of application and their comparisons or relations to other methods will be given. The problems associated with these methods will also be analysed. This is the first review on this topic and we believe that it helps to give an overview of the decoupling methods which have been so far proposed in the literature. We also believe that this review will help clarify some main differences and relations between the various decoupling methods and provide some information for future research on the problem of mutual coupling...|$|R

However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply. Scharnhorst was hit twice during the engagement, but both shells failed to explode.

25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} half-wave dipole mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal <b>antenna</b> <b>array,</b> fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube intermediate frequency (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower Y-axis plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper plate on the Y-axis was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically. Signals being received from the antenna would thus cause the beam to deflect downward to produce a blip, {{as in the case of}} Chain Home.|$|E
25|$|Then between 1986 and 1989, new {{techniques}} were brought into play {{to combine the}} signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, {{in a kind of}} an <b>antenna</b> <b>array.</b> This was done at Goldstone, California, Canberra, and Madrid using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second transmission antenna system. One had a fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider <b>antenna</b> <b>array,</b> narrowing the pattern and making it much easier to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, and once a target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the narrow beam. Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E

40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand for {{wireless}} data, base stations with very large <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> are being deployed in order to serve multiple users simultaneously. Concurrently, there is growing interest in full-duplex operation. The challenge to full-duplex is suppressing the high-powered self-interference caused by transmitting and receiving {{at the same time}} on the same frequency. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art methods to suppress self-interference require extra analog circuitry that does not scale well to large <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays.</b> However, large <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays</b> open a new opportunity to use digital beamforming to reduce the self-interference.

The Rajendra is a high power Passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80km with 18km height coverage against small fighter sized targets {{and is able to}} track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high speed signal processing system with adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs and variable pulse repetition frequency.

25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver <b>antenna</b> <b>array</b> with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E
