The play depicted an October 1938 meeting between Soviet spy Guy Burgess, then {{a young man}} working for the BBC, and Winston Churchill. Cumberbatch portrayed Burgess; Churchill was played by Matthew Marsh, who had played a supporting role in Hawking. He narrated the 6-part series South Pacific (US title: Wild Pacific), which aired from May to June 2009 on BBC 2.|$|E
5|$|Folklorists see the jackalope <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{group of}} fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days.

5|$|Several annual events—many of them {{centered}} on performing and visual arts—draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the Ann Arbor Art Fairs, {{a set of}} four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets. Scheduled on Thursday through Sunday of {{the third week of}} July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors. Another is the Ann Arbor Film Festival, held during the third week of March, which receives more than 2,500 submissions annually from more than 40 countries and serves <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handful of Academy Award–qualifying festivals in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Don Valley Parkway, {{along with}} the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto's busiest {{municipal}} routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancient city}} of Sarapion is {{believed}} to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu. It is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral. According to the Periplus, maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean coast.|$|E
5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency {{is widely regarded as}} a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped {{bring an end to the}} dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handful of seats that Democrats {{had an opportunity to}} gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E

5|$|Helliwell {{returned}} to playing non-League football when joining Southern League club Ilkeston Town in 1998 and featured {{for them in}} FA Cup matches against Football League teams Carlisle United and Swindon Town. Having {{returned to}} semi-professional football, he worked part-time as an electrician. Helliwell took over as caretaker manager at Ilkeston after Keith Alexander resigned in October 2000, and led the team to {{the first round of}} the FA Cup before John McGovern was appointed in November. In March 2001, Helliwell was appointed <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-man management team at Ilkeston alongside former Burnley teammate Charlie Bishop and former York teammate Chris Marples. The trio guided the club to safety at the end of 2000–01; Marples was consequently hired as manager on a permanent basis in May 2001 and Helliwell returned to his playing role. After Marples left Ilkeston in March 2002, Bishop and Helliwell took caretaker charge before John McGinlay was appointed later that month. Helliwell retired from football following 2001–02, having spent four seasons with Ilkeston.|$|E
5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of the season, Able, formed {{prior to}} the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May16 and executed a counterclockwise loop over the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane Charlie was a powerful Category4 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relatively few Category5 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean. It briefly neared Category5 status and interacted with Hurricane Fox, marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another's path.|$|E
