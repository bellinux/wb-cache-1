The President appoints chairs and membership of six standing committees, four legislative committees as well as the Executive Nominations and Rules Committees. When compared to other state legislatures in the United States, the Maryland Senate has one of the strongest presiding officers and some of the strongest committee chairs. Senators are also organized into caucuses, including party- and demographically-based caucuses. They are assisted in their work by paid staff of the non-partisan Department of Legislative Services and by partisan office staff.|$|E

On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09am. EDT and ended at 7:29am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24am. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional {{time to make sure}} the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.|$|E

25|$|Under Calles's rule in 1926, a {{constitutional}} change was passed that {{allowed for a}} non-consecutive re-election, and in 1928 Obregón was elected as Calles's successor; this amendment was later repealed in 1934. In addition, Mexico passed {{an amendment to the}} constitution in 1927 that allowed <b>a</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> serve a six-year term. However, Obregón was murdered by José de León Toral, a Catholic militant, before he could assume power. To avoid a political vacuum, Calles named himself Jefe Máximo, the political chieftain of Mexico and Emilio Portes Gil was appointed temporary president, although in reality he {{was little more than a}} puppet of Calles. The following year, Calles founded the PNR, or Partido Nacional Revolucionario, the predecessor of today's Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI).|$|E
25|$|In October 1935, Manuel L.

It was later amended in 1940 to limit <b>a</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> serving {{no more than two}} four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the Empire of Japan in World War II, he appointed Chief Justice José Abad Santos as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces.

25|$|Local {{elections}} {{were held in}} 1987. It began when the government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties, {{announced that it would}} be prepared to share power with representatives of opposition groups {{in the event of a}} coalition government, and issued a new constitution providing for a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), consisting of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga), and <b>a</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> be indirectly elected to a 7-year term. The new political parties had to oppose colonialism, imperialism, neo-colonialism, Zionism, racial discrimination, apartheid and fascism. Najibullah stated that only the extremist part of the opposition could not join the planned coalition government. No parties had to share the PDPA's policy or ideology, but they could not oppose the bond between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A parliamentary election was held in 1988. The PDPA won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government. The only armed opposition party to make peace with the government was Hizbollah, a small Shi'a party not to be confused with the bigger party in Iran or the Lebanese organization.|$|E

[...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it [...] "offers the kind of episode that only The Simpsons could pull off well. The idea of bringing <b>a</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> live in Springfield is high-concept to say the least, and it could– and probably should– have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show."
