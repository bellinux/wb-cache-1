40|$|Afterbody and nozzle {{pressures}} {{measured on}} a 1 / 12 -scale model and in flight on a twin-jet fighter aircraft were compared as Mach number varied from 0. 6 to 1. 2, Reynolds number from 17. 5 million to 302. 5 million, and angle of attack from 1 to 7 deg. At Mach 0. 6 and 0. 8, nozzle pressure coefficient distributions and nozzle axial force coefficients agreed and showed good recompression. At Mach 0. 9 and 1. 2, flow complexity caused a loss in recompression for both flight and wind tunnel nozzle data. The flight data exhibited less negative values of pressure coefficient and lower axial force coefficients than did the wind tunnel data. Reynolds number effects were noted only at these Mach numbers. Jet temperature and mass flux ratio {{did not affect the}} comparisons of nozzle axial flow coefficient. At subsonic speeds, the levels of pressure coefficient distributions on the upper fuselage and lower nacelle surfaces for flight were less negative than those for the model. The model boundary layer thickness at the <b>aft</b> <b>rake</b> station exceeded that for the forward rake station and increased with increasing angle of attack. The flight boundary layer thickness at the <b>aft</b> <b>rake</b> station was less than that for the forward rake station and decreased with increasing angle of attack...|$|E
5000|$|The clipper type {{bow of the}} pinas {{often carried}} a carved figurehead called [...] "Gobel" [...] and the transom stern was <b>raked</b> <b>aft</b> and reached pretty high up above the waterline. The pinas had a well defined sheer and was a {{seaworthy}} vessel.|$|R
2500|$|... "The CSR is {{not built}} for long-distance highway travel. Although the ride quality {{falls short of}} punishing, I had {{strongly}} discourage using the car for emergency surgery. The otherwise comfy seats move fore and <b>aft,</b> but the <b>rake</b> is fixed, which can be-and was for me-a real pain. Speaking of driver discomforts, there's no dead pedal for your left foot, and your right thigh gets a good grilling from the aluminum transmission tunnel. The snap-shut side curtains cannot be raised or lowered like conventional windows, so you're either freezing or sweltering." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{those three}} {{varieties}} of fore-and-aft rig, the cutter--the racing rig par excellence--is of an appearance the most imposing, {{from the fact}} that practically all her canvas is in one piece. The enormous mainsail of a cutter, as she draws slowly past a point of land or the end of a jetty under your admiring gaze, invests her with an air of lofty and silent majesty. At anchor a schooner looks better; she has an aspect of greater efficiency and a better balance to the eye, with her two masts distributed over the hull with a swaggering <b>rake</b> <b>aft.</b> The yawl rig one comes in time to love. It is, I should think, the easiest of all to manage.|$|R
5000|$|In naval architecture, a transom is {{the surface}} {{that forms the}} stern of a vessel. Transoms may be flat or curved {{and they may be}} vertical, raked forward, also known as a retroussé or reverse transom, angling forward (toward the bow) from the {{waterline}} to the deck, or <b>raked</b> <b>aft,</b> often simply called [...] "raked", angling in the other direction. The bottom tip of the transom can be approximately on the waterline, in which case the stern of the vessel is referred to as a [...] "transom stern", or the hull can continue so that the centreline is well above the waterline before terminating in a transom, in which case it is referred to as a [...] "counter stern" [...] or [...] "cutaway stern." ...|$|R
5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire {{as best he could}} while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her from the other side and the flûtes took up stations fore and <b>aft,</b> repeatedly <b>raking</b> the British ship. Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron was so close to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck, killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|R
60|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} the clipper build are, knife-like sharpness of the cut-water and bow, and exceeding correctness of cut in the sails, so that these may be drawn as tight and flat as possible. Too much bulge in a sail is a disadvantage {{in the way of}} sailing. Indeed, flatness is so important a desideratum, that experimentalists have more than once applied sails made of thin planks of wood to their clippers; but we do not know that this {{has turned out to be}} much of an improvement. The masts of all clippers, except those of the sloop or cutter rig, generally <b>rake</b> <b>aft</b> a good deal--that is, they lean backwards; a position which is supposed to tend to increase speed. Merchant vessels are seldom of the clipper build, because the sharpness of this peculiar formation diminishes the available space for cargo very much.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the most}} {{unexpected}} sights assailed us. It {{seemed to me}} as if a miraculous change had taken place on everybody and everything during the night. The ship when she had set sail was as untidy and lumbered about the decks as a merchantman usually is on quitting port. Now everything was clean, in its place, snugly fastened, and in order. The sails appeared to have undergone some modification. I fancied, too, that the masts <b>raked</b> <b>aft</b> a good deal more than they had done, and round the foot of them were ranged muskets, pistols, cutlasses, and boarding-pikes, where masses of cordage and handspikes had been before. The hencoops had vanished, and in their place were rows of brass carronades, while in the centre of the deck an enormous swivel gun occupied the place, on which the long-boat had formerly rested. Even the captain seemed to have changed. His costume was somewhat Eastern in its character, and his whole aspect was much more ferocious than when I first saw him.|$|R
2500|$|The visual unpopularity of Seppings' {{circular}} stern {{was soon}} rectified by Sir William Symonds. In this revised stern, {{a set of}} straight post timbers (also called [...] "whiskers", [...] "horn timbers", or [...] "fan tail timbers") stretches from the keel diagonally aft and upward. It rests {{on the top of}} the sternpost and runs on either side of the rudder post (thus creating the [...] "helm port" [...] through which the rudder passes) to a point well above the vessel's waterline. Whereas the timbers of the transom stern all heeled on the wing transom, the timbers of the elliptical stern all heel on the whiskers, to which they are affixed at a 45̊ angle (i.e., [...] "canted") when viewed from overhead and decrease in length as they are installed aft until the curvature is complete. [...] The finished stern has a continuous curved edge around the outside and is <b>raked</b> <b>aft.</b> Other names for the elliptical stern include a [...] "counter stern," [...] in reference to its very long counter, and a [...] "cutaway stern." [...] The elliptical stern began use during the age of sail, but remained very popular for both merchant and warships well into the nautical age of steam and through the first eight decades of steamship construction (roughly 1840–1920), despite the fact that the design left the rudder exposed and vulnerable in combat situations.|$|R
