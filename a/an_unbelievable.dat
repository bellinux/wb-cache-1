25|$|As in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via {{free agency}} to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the 2002–03 campaign, the Stars awarded the {{starting}} goaltending position to Marty Turco, {{who went on}} to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76.

500|$|The Queen Marie of Romania {{sapphire}} {{is named}} from {{its association with}} Marie. Originally set in a necklace by Cartier in 1913, the drop jewel weighs 478 carats. It was transferred to a diamond necklace in 1919 and King Ferdinand purchased it for Marie in 1921. The price was 1,375,000 francs, to be paid in four installments until 1924. At the time, large jewelry had not excited Marie's interest; she preferred to wear a Greek cross or, when she attended the Paris Opera, her pearls. However, the sapphire sautoir (jewel chain) was an ideal match for the sapphire tiara she had bought from Russian exile Grand Duchess Vladimir. She wore them both at her coronation receptions and when sitting for her portrait by Philip de László. During her visit to the United States, when she presided over a ball at the New York Ritz-Carlton, one observer remarked: [...] "There was a heavy chain of diamonds, broken at intervals with squares of massive design.

Moore went to school officials and urged them to accept any offer Michigan gave them; he recalled telling them that [...] "It's an opportunity game.
