5|$|<b>A</b> <b>forced</b> {{variation}} {{that involves}} a sacrifice and usually {{results in a}} tangible gain is called a combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.|$|E
5|$|As {{explained}} below, chess theorists {{in recent}} decades have continued to debate the size and nature of White's advantage, if any. Apart from Berliner, they have rejected the idea that White has <b>a</b> <b>forced</b> win from the opening position. Many also reject the traditional paradigm that Black's objective should be to neutralize White's initiative and obtain equality.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two {{disturbance}} observer (DOB) based explicit robust force control systems, in which <b>a</b> <b>force</b> sensor and <b>a</b> reaction <b>force</b> observer (RFOB) {{are used to}} detect contact forces, are compared in terms of stability, robustness and performance. <b>A</b> <b>force</b> sensor detects contact forces implicitly by estimating the strains of a strain gauge. The compliancy of <b>a</b> <b>force</b> sensor degrades the stability and performance of <b>a</b> <b>force</b> control system. Besides, noise is another challenging issue in <b>a</b> <b>force</b> sensor based force control implementation. Against <b>a</b> <b>force</b> sensor, <b>a</b> RFOB detects contact forces explicitly by using the acceleration and force/torque signals of a servo system. Inasmuch as a RFOB detects contact forces explicitly, the stability and performance of <b>an</b> explicit <b>force</b> control system are improved intrinsically. However, a RFOB has a model based control structure; therefore, the stability and performance of the robust force control system may deteriorate by the imperfect identification of system uncertainties. New analysis and design tools are provided for the DOB based robust force control systems. Simulation and experimental results show {{the viability of the}} proposals...|$|R

It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944.

5|$|Although the Giants {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons in franchise history in 1990, the season had a difficult beginning as Taylor held out of training camp, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and <b>a</b> <b>forced</b> fumble.|$|E

Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E

50|$|Force is {{the action}} of one body on another. <b>A</b> <b>force</b> is either <b>a</b> push or <b>a</b> pull. <b>A</b> <b>force</b> tends to move a body in the {{direction}} of its action. The action of <b>a</b> <b>force</b> is characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its point of application. Thus, <b>force</b> is <b>a</b> vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the action.|$|R

5|$|Before the 2007 season, Alston {{competed with}} Ron Warner and Jabari Issa for a {{starting}} {{role on the}} Eskimos. He made the active roster and originally split time with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of the}} season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and <b>a</b> <b>forced</b> fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a factor in his release from the team.|$|E

But on November 9, 1972, FRELIMO – not numbering more than 8,000 fighters – launched a large offensive in Tete Province. The response from the Portuguese military was fierce, leading to reprisal attacks {{in an attempt to}} unbalance the local population's continuing faith in FRELIMO.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July. The next day, Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore was named the game's most valuable player. Moore had a sack, a tackle for a loss, a blocked punt and <b>a</b> <b>forced</b> fumble. His performance was representative by a successful defensive effort by the Virginia Tech Hokies, who blocked two punts, had three interceptions, and limited Alabama to only seven points and 50 rushing yards. Tech's 31-point margin of victory was the biggest bowl-game win in school history, and Alabama's loss was their biggest in a bowl game since a loss in the 1972 Orange Bowl.|$|E
