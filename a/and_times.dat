50|$|In {{discussions about}} space <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> the name relationalism (or relationism) refers to Leibniz's relationist notion of space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> as against Newton's substantivalist views. According to Newton’s substantivalism, space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> are {{entities}} {{in their own}} right, existing independently of things. Leibniz’s relationism, on the other hand, describes space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> as systems of relations that exist between objects.|$|R

40|$|We review some modern {{theories}} about the structure of space <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> in particular those related to discrete space <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> Following an epistemological method we start from theories which discuss discrete space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> as a mathematical tool to solve physical models. Antother theories look for physical content of the discrete structure of space <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> based in relational theories of space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> which are derived from the relations of some fundamental entities. Finally we present some philosophical positions who {{try to find the}} ontological foundation of the relational theories os space <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> Comment: Proceedings: A. Dou eds.

40|$|The {{structures}} of space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> {{are identified as}} essential for the realization of cognitive systems.

The evolving interest in space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> in cognitive science and some of the current conceptions of space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> are briefly reviewed. It is argued that space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> not only structure cognitive representations and processes but also provide useful information for knowledge processing. Various ways of structuring space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> are discussed <b>and</b> the merits of different languages for describing space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> are addressed. In particular, qualitative and quantitative descriptions are related to local and global reference frames and crisp qualities are related to fuzzy quantities. The importance of selecting an appropriate level of interpretation for a given description is stressed. Examples of interpreting spatial and temporal object descriptions in various ways are presented...|$|R

40|$|A new {{direction}} in social perception research is developed. The present research explored {{the impact of}} familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on social perception processes based on cognitive neuroscience models, social categorization models, and memory consolidation constructs. Familiarity was manipulated within an exposure task <b>and</b> <b>time</b> was manipulated by testing participants both 2 - 6 hr and 48 hr after the exposure task. Experiment 1 investigated the influence of familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on the argument of the automaticity of social categorization and associated stereotypes by testing the argument with two separate tasks. Experiment 1 a tested the influence of familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on associated stereotypes and found that, with familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> participants responded to individualizing information faster than to stereotypic information. Experiment 1 b tested the influence of familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on social categorization and found further support for the automaticity of social categorization. Experiment 2 further investigated the influence of familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on social perception by embedding cognitive loads within a categorization task. Experiment 2 found little support for the influence of familiarity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on social categorization and cognitive loads. The current research is discussed for its relevance to models of social perception. ...|$|R

My exegesis of Being <b>and</b> <b>Time</b> will determine that the being-in-the-world of Dasein is understood through a technological horizon in which all entities are subordinate to a productive and pragmatic schema. What Dasein primarily encounters in the environment is not a robust understanding of nature as inherently valuable, but raw material. Thus, I will conclude that Being <b>and</b> <b>Time</b> is inconsistent with environmentalism...|$|R
