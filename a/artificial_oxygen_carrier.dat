40|$|Removal of nitrite and nitrate from {{drinking}} water has attracted great attention {{in recent years}} because of the human health risk induced by the exposure to contaminated groundwater and surface water. We have therefore tested a model nitrite oxidation system by coentrapping the NaNO 2 oxidizer Nitrobacter vulgaris with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) copolymer and DEAE-Sephadex in a polyacrylamide gel. The copolymer and the anion exchanger facilitate the diffusion of oxygen and NaNO 2, respectively, into the gel matrix. To test the nitrite-oxidizing activity, the entrapped cells were coupled to a thermal sensor. Coentrapment of 5 % (wt/vol) DEAE-Sephadex with Nitrobacter vulgaris increased the nitrite-oxidizing activity {{by a factor of}} 3. 7 compared to entrapped cells alone, and by the addition of 0. 86 % (wt/vol) <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> PDMS copolymer increased the activity further to 4. 3 times higher.

To {{characterize the}} efficacy of the new <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier,</b> liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LHb), HS was induced by withdrawing 20 % of the total blood volume from rats. Rats received one of five interventions: LHb resuscitation (LHb-G, n = 7), normal saline (Saline-G, n = 7), shed autologous blood (SAB-G, n = 7), volume expander of 5 % albumin (Albumin-G, n = 7), or no treatment (Sham-G, n = 7). Heart rate variability (HRV) indices were measured, including low frequency (LF, 0. 10 – 0. 60 Hz), high frequency (HF, 0. 60 – 2. 00 Hz), and the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF). LF and LF/HF following HS were lower in the LHb-G and SAB-G groups when compared with the Saline-G, Albumin-G and Sham-G groups.

Recruitment and {{activation of}} neutrophils {{is thought to}} be a key event causing I/R injury. We examined whether post-ischemic intra-arterial infusion of liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH), an <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> without neutrophils, could reduce I/R injury in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 -h MCAO and then were divided into three groups: (1) LEH group (n= 7) infused with LEH (Hb concentration of 6 g/dl, 10 ml/kg/h) through the recanalized internal carotid artery for 2 h, (2) vehicle group (n= 8) infused with saline (10 ml/kg/h) {{in the same manner as}} the LEH group, and (3) control group (n= 9) subjected to recanalization only. After 24 -h reperfusion, all rats were tested for neurological score and then sacrificed to examine infarct and edema volumes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) expression and activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Compared with the control group and the vehicle group, the LEH group showed a significantly better neurological score and significantly smaller infarct and edema volumes. MPO expression, MMP- 9 expression and activity, and ROS production in the LEH group were also significantly lower than those in the control and vehicle groups. The results in the present study suggest that post-ischemic intra-arterial infusion of LEH can reduce I/R injury through reducing the effect of MMP- 9, most likely produced by neutrophils. This therapeutic strategy may be a promising candidate to prevent I/R injury after thrombolysis and/or thromboectomy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Encapsulating hemoglobin inside a protective lipid membrane, which mimics a red blood cell, has the advantages of decreasing the toxicity of the free hemoglobin, increasing its circulation time, and permitting the co-encapsulation of hemoglobin protectants to prevent conversion of oxyhemoglobin to met-hemoglobin. We have recently developed a LEH formulation with an increased hemoglobin concentration as well as improved biological tolerability. Our group has developed several novel methods of assessing the circulation and efficacy of LEH formulations {{through the use of}} radiotracers and small animal imaging. These tracer studies are based on the physiologic imaging techniques of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) that are currently used in clinical nuclear medicine.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{effect of the}} perfluorocarbon-based <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> (Oxygent) was investigated in tissue-engineered trachea (TET) construction. Media supplemented with and without 10 % Oxygent were compared in all assessments. Partial tissue oxygen tension (PtO(2)) was measured with polarographic microprobes; epithelial metabolism was monitored by microdialysis inside the TET epithelium perfused with the medium underneath. Chondrocyte-DegraPol constructs were cultured for 1 month with the medium before glycosaminoglycan assessment and histology. Tissue reaction of TET epithelial scaffolds immersed with the medium was evaluated on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. Oxygent perfusion medium increased the TET epithelial PtO(2) (51. 2 +/- 0. 3 mm Hg vs. 33. 4 +/- 0. 3 mm Hg at 200 microm thickness; 12. 5 +/- 0. 1 mm Hg vs. 3. 1 +/- 0. 1 mm Hg at 400 microm thickness, p < 0. 01) and decreased the lactate concentration (0. 63 +/- 0. 08 vs. 0. 80 +/- 0. 06 mmol/L, p < 0. 05), lactate/pyruvate (1. 87 +/- 0. 26 vs. 3. 36 +/- 10. 13, p < 0. 05), and lactate/glucose ratios (0. 10 +/- 0. 00 vs. 0. 29 +/- 0. 14, p < 0. 05).

Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging showed no difference in functional capillary density between the scaffolds cultured on chorioallantoic membranes.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{insidious}} characteristics of cancer is its spread to and ability to compromise distant organs via the complex process of metastasis. Communication between cancer cells and organ-resident cells via cytokines/chemokines and direct cell-cell contacts are key steps for survival, proliferation and invasion of metastasized cancer cells in organs. Precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) are considered to closely reflect the in vivo situation and are potentially useful for studying the interaction of cancer cells with liver-resident cells {{as well as being}} a potentially useful tool for screening anti-cancer reagents. Application of the PCLS technique in the field of cancer research however, has not yet been well developed. Results: We established the mouse PCLS system using perfluorodecalin (PFD) as an <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> Using this system we show that the adherence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled MDA-MB- 231 (highly invasive) cells to liver tissue in the PCLS was 5 -fold greater than that of SK-BR- 3 (less invasive) cells. In addition, we generated PCLS from THOC 5, a member of transcription/export complex (TREX), knockout (KO) mice. The PCLS still expressed Gapdh or Albumin mRNAs at normal levels, while several chemokine/growth factor or metalloprotease genes, such as Cxcl 12, Pdgfa, Tgfb, Wnt 11, and Mmp 1 a genes were downregulated more than 2 -fold. Interestingly, adhesion of cancer cells to THOC 5 KO liver slices was far less (greater than 80 % reduction) than to wild-type liver slices. Conclusion: Mouse PCLS cultures in the presence of PFD may serve as a useful tool for screening local adherence and invasiveness of individual cancer cells, since single cells can be observed. This method may also prove useful for identification of genes in liver-resident cells that support cancer invasion by using PCLS from transgenic liver...|$|E
40|$|As more {{patients}} with large {{body surface area}} burns are surviving and requiring reconstructive surgery, there is a necessity for advances {{in the provision of}} bioengineered alternatives to autologous skin cover. The aims of this Thesis are to identify feasible source tissues of Endothelial Colony Forming Cells and Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells for microvascular network formation in vitro with three-dimensional dermal substitute scaffolds. The working hypothesis is that pre-vascularised dermal scaffolds will result in better quality scarring when used with split thickness skin grafts. Human umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood and adipose tissue were collected and processed with ethical approval and informed consent. Samples were cultured to form endothelial outgrowth colonies and confluent Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells, which were characterised using flow cytometry and expanded in vitro. Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cell multipotency was confirmed with tri-lineage mesenchymal differentiation. Primary cells were tested in a two-dimensional tubule formation co-culture assay and differences assessed using a proangiogenic antibody array. Tubule formation was tested in four different acellular dermal substitute scaffolds; Integra® Dermal Regeneration Template, Matriderm®, Neuskin-F® and De-cellularised Human Cadaveric Dermis. Umbilical cord blood was the most reliable source of Endothelial Colony Forming Cells, the yield of which could be predicted from placental weight. Microvasculature dissected free from adipose tissue was a reliable source of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells which supported significantly more tubule formation than Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells from whole adipose tissue. Microvasculature Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells secreted significantly higher levels of the proangiogenic hormone leptin, and addition of exogenous leptin to the tubule formation assay resulted in significantly increased tubule formation. Microvasculature was cultured in all four of the scaffolds tested, but depth of penetration was limited to 100 µm. The <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> perfluorocarbon was shown to increase two-dimensional tubule formation and may be useful in further three-dimensional scaffolds studies to improve microvascular penetration.

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in surgical and anesthesia techniques, subtle neurologic injury still remains an important complication after cardiac surgery. Because the causes are multifactorial and complex, research {{in an appropriate}} small animal model for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is warranted. This thesis describes several applications and adaptations of a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass, all aimed to improve perioperative outcomes. First an appropriately sized oxygenator was implemented in the model. We then subjected old rats and diabetic rats to 90 min of CPB, and found that if CPB causes cognitive deficits, these are only subtle. Further, we investigated whether different temperature strategies would improve outcome. We concluded that mild hypothermia during CPB and continued into the postoperative period may have a beneficial effect. In the model we also tested a RNA molecule (aptamer) that inhibits Factor IX and thus is a very effective anticoagulant and a possible replacement for heparin. Anticoagulation during CPB and reversal with the aptamer were non-inferior compared to heparin, but 3 hr postoperative cardiac function was improved in the aptamer group {{when compared to the}} heparin/protamine group. Because hypoperfusion is thought to contribute to the observed deficits in humans, we tested an <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier,</b> able to dissolve large quantities of oxygen and deliver it in the microvasculature, in our rat CPB model. Administration of the oxygen carrier led to increased inflammation an mortality in the experimental group. In addition, we adapted the model to better mimic specific clinical situations and related research questions. We improved the model by induction of cardioplegic cardiac arrest while on CPB. Due to the closed-chest approach, survivability is warranted and longterm functional (ultrasound), enzymatic or histological outcomes can be assessed. To mimic embolic showers as can occur during cardiac surgery, we injected holmium microspheres. Due to the paramagnetic properties of holmium, the microspheres cause artifacts on MRI and can thus be easily located and quantified. We also changed the current delivery and injection technique and found the delivery reproducible in location and delivered load. We believe that the models described in this thesis will continue to help research aimed to improve perioperative outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} bovine {{hemoglobin}} (HbBv) have suggested amino acid substitutions, which might introduce into human hemoglobin (HbA) functional characteristics of HbBv, namely a low intrinsic oxygen affinity regulated by Cl(-). Accordingly, we have constructed and characterized a multiple mutant, PB 5, [beta(V 1 M + H 2 Delta + T 4 I + P 5 A + A 76 K) ] replacing four amino acid residues of HbA with those present at structurally analogous positions in HbBv, plus an additional substitution, beta T 4 I, {{which does not}} occur in either HbBv or HbA. This 'pseudobovine' hemoglobin has oxygen binding properties {{very similar to those}} of HbBv: the P(50) of HbA, PB 5 and HbBv in the absence of Cl(-) are 1. 6, 4. 6 and 4. 8 torr, respectively, and in 100 mM Cl(-) are 3. 7, 10. 5 and 12 torr, respectively. Moreover, PB 5 has 3 -fold slower autoxidation rate compared to HbA and HbBv. These are desirable characteristics for a human hemoglobin to be considered for use as a clinical <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> Although the functional properties of PB 5 and HbBv are similar, van't Hoff plots indicate that the two hemoglobins interact differently with water, suggesting that factors regulating the R to T equilibrium are not the same in the two proteins. A further indication that PB 5 is not a functional mimic of HbBv derives from PB 5 (control), a human hemoglobin with the same substitutions as PB 5, except the beta T 4 I replacement. PB 5 (control) has a high oxygen affinity (P(50) = 2. 3 torr) in the absence of Cl(-), but retains the Cl(-) effect of PB 5. The Cl(-) regulation of oxygen affinity in PB 5 involves lysine residues at beta 8 and beta 76. PB 4, which has the same substitutions as PB 5 except beta A 76 K, and PB 6, which has all the substitutions of PB 5 plus beta K 8 Q, both have a low intrinsic oxygen affinity, like HbBv and PB 5, but exhibit a decreased sensitivity to Cl(-). Since HbBv has lysine residues at both beta 8 and beta 76, these results imply that Cl(-) regulation in HbBv likewise involves these two residues. The mechanism responsible for the low intrinsic oxygen affinity of HbBv remains unclear. It is suggested that residues peculiar to HbBv at the alpha(1) beta(1) interface may play a role...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Heart {{transplantation}} is {{the first}} choice of surgical treatment in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, the waiting list for cardiac transplantation is increasing since the mid- 90 ’s, with a stabilization of the amount of transplants. A possibility to increase the donor pool would be by also using the deceased after cardiac death (DCD) donors, however with a warm ischemic period these organs are more affected by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The current preservation method; cold storage (CS), is not sufficient enough to preserve these hearts, therefore a perfusion apparatus needs to be developed for the perfusion preservation and warm oxygenated reperfusion. Materials & Methods: Hearts obtained from slaughter pigs were used as donors for setting up and testing parameters of the heart perfusion system during perfusion preservation (20 °C) as well as during warm oxygenated reperfusion (37 °C). Pressure, flow, temperature and oedema were measured during the perfusion preservation and during the warm oxygenated reperfusion period. The ability of resuscitating the heart and measuring the functionality of the heart was investigated in the warm oxygenated reperfusion model. Results: A procurement method has been developed which mimics the DCD donor procedure of hearts. Also a perfusion preservation machine has been designed for the perfusion preservation of the pig heart. However, this system was unable to reach and maintain a temperature of 20 °C. A warm oxygenated reperfusion set-up has been designed for the controlled warm oxygenated reperfusion of the heart. However, {{we were not able to}} resuscitate the heart in this set up, and reach a (un) loaded state. High concentrations of potassium were measured in the porcine blood and warm oxygenated perfusion fluid. For the whole process of procurement, perfusion preservation and warm oxygenated reperfusion, protocols have been made. Conclusion: The procurement method mimics the DCD donor procedure of hearts quite well, the hearts might be useful for unloaded beating but not for functional measurements. Porcine blood should not be used for warm oxygenated reperfusion of the heart. Carefully obtained donor blood should be used, or an <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> The perfusion preservation apparatus is suitable for the heart; however a heat exchanger should be added to the system. We recommend doing the perfusion preservation with Steen at 20 °C with a pressure of 40 mm Hg. The warm oxygenated reperfusion apparatus needs better isolation and a warm water bath in which the heart should immerse. We recommend to execute the warm oxygenated reperfusion with Steen and an oxygen carrier at 37 °C with a pressure of 60 mm Hg. ...|$|E

The goal of {{drug delivery}} systems, is to deploy medications intact to specifically targeted organs and compartments of the body through a medium that can control administration of the active principle by means of either a physiological or chemical trigger. During the past decade, polymeric micro-nanoparticles, polymer micelles, and hydrogel-type materials have all been shown to be effective in enhancing drug targeting specificity, lowering systemic drug toxicity, improving treatment absorption rates, and providing protection for pharmaceuticals against biochemical degradation. The research activities reported in the present thesis are the result of experimental work performed at the Laboratory of Polymeric Materials for Biomedical and Environmental Applications (Biolab) of the Department of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry of the University of Pisa and in part at SINTEF company (Trondheim, Norway). The aim of the present PhD thesis was mainly focused on the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles based on Poly(maleic anhydride–alt–butyl vinyl ether) 5 % grafted with methoxyPEG 2000 and 95 % grafted with 2 -methoxyethanol (VAM 41) loaded with human Hemoglobin to be used as <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers.</b> Nanoparticles were prepared by means of the co-precipitation technique performed under controlled conditions in order to minimize oxidative phenomena; nanoparticles characterization was carried out in terms of size, morphology and surface properties analysis, highlighting the feasibility of obtaining Hemoglobin loaded polymeric nanoparticles possessing suitable features to be used as <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers.</b> The maintenance of protein functional bioactivities, once loaded inside nanoparticles, was also investigated; results showed that although protein secondary and quaternary structure seems to be maintained, Hemoglobin oxidation takes place during the formulation process. To overcome this inactivating phenomenon different strategies were investigated including the introduction of several reducing agents inside the formulation system as well as the modification of the polymeric structure by means of the introduction of a conductive moiety. Although Hemoglobin oxidation phenomenon during the formulation process was not avoided, alterations regarding nanoparticles features were not observed, highlighting the versatility of the so developed system and opening promising perspectives in the development of VAM 41 based polymeric nanoparticles loaded with functional Hemoglobin. The use of Alginate as alternative polymeric matrix was also investigated; the formulation process based on the ionic gelation was optimised carrying out successfully the reduction of Alginate particles dimensions from a millimetric to a micrometric scale, without affecting particle protein contents. Results obtained during this research activity indicated Alginate as a potential polymeric matrix usable in the development of <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers.</b> Moreover, during a six months visiting period spent at SINTEF, the research activity was focused on the development of VAM 41 based polymeric nanoparticles loaded with Dead Sea Salts, to be used as dermal drug delivery system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} was the design and development of an oxygen carrier system for oxygenation of liver cells (hepatocytes) in a bio-artificial liver support system. Acute liver failure is a devastating condition with higher than 80 % mortality. Currently the only successful treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation. The high mortality rate could be reduced if a system could be developed that could bridge the patient either until recovery (due to the liver’s well-known regeneration ability) or until transplantation. Such a system requires a bioreactor with a high density of cultured cells. Sufficient oxygen delivery to the cells is critical to ensure efficient cell function. The CSIR and University of Pretoria (UP) have designed and developed a novel bio-artificial liver support system (BALSS) that utilizes perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) as <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> As the PFOB is not miscible with water, {{it needs to be}} emulsified. To enable the use of the PFOB emulsion in the UP-CSIR BALSS, a study was carried out to investigate relevant aspects relating to the PFOB emulsion, i. e. the formulation, manufacturing procedure, stability, rheology and mass transfer characteristics. The study results are reported in this dissertation, including a proposed mass transfer model for describing oxygen mass transfer to and from the PFOB emulsions. Emulsion stability can be improved through control of the droplet size and size distribution, limiting Ostwald ripening, and control of zeta potential of the dispersed phase droplets. PFOB emulsions with dispersed phase (PFOB) volume fractions between 0. 4 and 0. 5 and Sauter mean droplet diameter between 100 and 200 nm were found to be optimal for oxygen mass transfer in cell culture systems. The PFOB emulsion in the UP-CSIR BALSS can be concentrated and recirculated using ultrafiltration. Quantitative recovery of PFOB from its emulsions can be carried out using distillation with orthophosphoric acid. Experimental overall mass transfer coefficients for membrane oxygenators obtained without PFOB compared well with literature reported values of 2. 5 x 10 - 5 m/s by Goerke et al. (2002) and 1 – 3 x 10 - 5 m/s by Schneider et al. (1995) for similar systems. The addition of 0. 2 v/v PFOB leads to an increase in the membrane oxygenator mass transfer coefficient by a factor of about 30, and an increase in oxygen carrying capacity by a factor of about 4. 5. It was also shown that suitable PFOB emulsions can {{have a significant impact on}} the growth and function of hepatocytes in a BALSS.

40|$|Background. This single-blind {{randomized}} {{study in}} general surgery evaluated {{the efficacy of}} perflubron emulsion (PFC) as an <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> being used to augment preoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution to reduce and avoid transfusion of both allogeneic erythrocytes and erythrocytes from preoperative autologous donation compared with standard of care. Methods: Subjects (N = 492) with hemoglobin concentrations of 12 - 15 g/dl undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures with 20 ml/kg or greater expected blood loss were randomized into two groups. Control patients were transfused intraoperatively at a hemoglobin concentration less than 8. 0 ± 0. 5 g/dl or at protocol-defined, physiologic triggers. PFC-treated patients first underwent acute normovolemic hemodilution to hemoglobin of 8. 0 ± 0. 5 g/dl, followed by dosing with perflubron emulsion (1. 8 g/kg). When hemoglobin reached less than 6. 5 ± 0. 5 g/dl, an additional 0. 9 -g/kg dose was given. PFC patients were transfused at hemoglobin less than 5. 5 ± 0. 5 g/dl or at predefined physiologic triggers. After surgery, hemoglobin was maintained at 8. 5 ± 0. 5 g/dl or greater in all patients until discharge. Efficacy endpoints included the number of allogeneic and preoperative autologous donation units transfused {{and the percentage of}} subjects avoiding transfusion. Results: Both groups had similar hemoglobin concentrations at screening (13. 5 ± 1. 0 g/dl) and at discharge: 10. 8 ± 1. 2 g/dl (PFC) and 11. 1 ± 1. 3 g/dl (control). At 24 h, more patients in the PFC group avoided allogeneic and preoperative autologous donation erythrocyte transfusions (53 % vs. 43 %, P < 0. 05), and fewer erythrocytes were transfused (1. 5 ± 4. 8 vs. 2. 1 ± 3. 9 units; median, 0 vs. 1 unit; P = 0. 013). By day of discharge, these differences were not significant in the intent-to-treat population, but overall there were less allogeneic and preoperative autologous donation erythrocyte transfusions in the PFC group (696 vs. 846 units). In the protocol-defined target population (n = 330 subjects with blood loss ≥ 20 ml/kg), significantly greater avoidance of any erythrocyte transfusion was maintained through day of hospital discharge (26 % vs. 16 % in the PFC and control groups, respectively; P < 0. 05), and there was also a significant {{reduction in the number of}} erythrocyte units transfused (3. 4 ± 2. 9 vs. 4. 9 ± 2. 4 units; median 2 vs. 4 units; P < 0. 001). Adverse events rates were similar in the PFC (86 %) and control (81 %) groups; however, more serious adverse events were reported in the PFC group (32 %) than in controls (21 %; P < 0. 05). Overall mortality was 3 %, and the difference between groups (PFC, 4 % vs. controls, 2 %) was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Augmented acute normovolemic hemodilution with PFC reduces transfusion needs in patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures with blood loss 20 ml/kg or greater...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis the {{production}} of novobiocin, an aminocoumarin antibiotic, was investigated in 24 -square deepwell plates, an alternative cultivation system to Erlenmeyer flasks. Comparison of novobiocin production in Erlenmeyer flasks and 24 -square deepwell plates showed that the production was originally higher in the Erlenmeyer flasks (24 mg/L vs. 11 mg/L). However, the variability was much lower in the deepwell plate (SD 6 % vs. 39 %). Optimization of the inoculation ratio and preparation of frozen inoculum from a defined section of the growth phase further reduced the variability, especially between independent cultivation batches (SD 6 % vs. 52 %). Addition of the water soluble siloxylated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer Q 2 - 5247, as <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier,</b> as well as the overexpression of the pathway-specific positive regulator NovG increased novobiocin production to levels comparable to those in the Erlenmeyer flasks (54 mg/L and 48 mg/L, respectively). Combination of the positive effects of NovG and of copolymer Q 2 - 5247 led to a novobiocin production of 163 mg/L, exceeding all previous production levels observed in Erlenmeyer flasks in our laboratory. Coumermycin A 1, another aminocoumarin antibiotic, contains two types of pyrrole moieties, two terminal 5 -methylpyrrole- 2 -carboxylic acid moieties and the central 3 -methylpyrrole- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid moiety. The terminal pyrrole moiety is also present in clorobiocin and its biosynthesis from L-proline by action of CouN 1 - 7 is well investigated. However, the biosynthetic precursors of the central pyrrole moiety have remained unknown, and none of the genes or enzymes involved in its formation have been identified so far. In the second part of this thesis evidence is provided that five genes, termed couR 1 -couR 4, contained in a contiguous 4. 7 kb region within the coumermycin biosynthetic gene cluster, are required for the biosynthesis of the central pyrrole moiety. Each of these genes was deleted individually, resulting in a strong reduction (by at least 92 %) or an abolishment of coumermycin production. External feeding of the central pyrrole moiety, i. e. 3 -methylpyrrole- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid, restored coumermycin production. One of the enzymes involved, i. e. CouR 3, shows similarity to the L-threonine kinase PduX from Salmonella enterica, and feeding of O-phospho-L-threonine to a couR 3 defective mutant resulted in a moderate increase of coumermycin production, while feeding of L-threonine (0. 197 mg/L vs. 0. 143 mg/L) did not, indicating that the first step in the biosynthesis might be the phosphorylation of L-threonine. Feeding of [U- 13 C, 15 N]L-threonine and 13 C NMR analysis of the resulting labeled CPM monoamide unequivocally proved that threonine is incorporated intact into the central pyrrole moiety (19 % enrichment), providing the heterocyclic nitrogen as well as four of the seven carbons of this moiety. Therefore, the central pyrrole moiety is formed via a new, hitherto unknown biosynthetic pathway. A hypothesis for the reaction sequence leading to this moiety, starting from L-threonine and oxaloacetate, is presented. Caprazamycins are potent anti-mycobacterial liponucleoside antibiotics that belong to the translocase I inhibitors and are produced by Streptomyces sp. MK 730 - 62 F 2. In the third part of the presented thesis, a liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) method is reported for the structural elucidation of caprazamycins and liposidomycins from culture extracts of the respective producer strains. Both caprazamycins and liposidomycins were readily detected in positive as well as in negative ionization mode and the comparison of the fragmentation pattern revealed several characteristic product ions. These product ions can be divided into two groups, according to whether they still contain the fatty acid side chain or not. Those that lack the fatty acid side chain are characteristic for all caprazamycins and/or liposidomycins, respectively, and were used for the identification of six new caprazamycins that probably contain unsaturated fatty acid side chains. The proposed chemical formula of these new compounds fit that of the fatty acid moieties of the liposidomycins Y, Z, A, G, K and N, respectively. Furthermore, a chromatographic method using a boronic acid stationary phase, which was originally used for the purification of modified nucleosides from cell cultures, was adapted for the partial purification of the culture extracts. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit wurde die Produktion des Aminocoumarin-Antibiotikums Novobiocin in 24 -Kammer-Platten untersucht, welche ein alternatives Kultivierungssystem zu Erlenmeyerkolben darstellen. Ein Vergleich der Novobiocinproduktion in Erlenmeyerkolben und einer 24 -Kammer-Platte ergab zunächst eine deutlich höhere Produktion im Erlenmeyerkolben (24 mg/L vs. 11 mg/L). Die Kulturen aus der 24 -Kammer-Platte wiesen im Vergleich zu denen aus dem Erlenmeyerkolben allerdings deutlich geringere Produktionsschwankungen auf (Standardabweichung: 6 % vs. 39 %). Durch die Optimierung des Animpfverhältnisses sowie die Herstellung von eingefrorenem Inoculum aus Vorkulturen in der Wachstumsphase, konnte eine weiteren Abnahme der Variabilität, besonders zwischen unabhängige Kultivierungen (Standardabweichung: 6 % vs. 52 %), erreicht werden. Der Zusatz eines wasserlöslichen Copolymers aus Ethylenoxid und Propylenoxid sowie die Überexpression des spezifischen positiven Regulators NovG führte jeweils zu vergleichbaren Produktionen wie im Erlenmeyerkolben (54 mg/L bzw. 48 mg/L). Diese positiven Effekte von Copolymer-Zusatz und NovG-Überexpression lassen sich auch kombinieren, sodass schließlich eine Novobiocinproduktion von 163 mg/L erreicht werden konnte, was alle bisher von uns beobachteten Produktionsraten im Erlenmeyerkolben deutlich übersteigt. Coumermycin A 1, ein weiteres Aminocoumarin-Antibiotikum, enthält zwei verschiedene Pyrroleinheiten, die beiden endständigen 5 -Methylpyrrol- 2 -carbonsäure-Einheiten und die zentrale 3 -Methylpyrrol- 2, 4 -di-carbonsäure. Die endständige Pyrroleinheit findet sich auch im Clorobiocin wieder und ihre Biosynthese, ausgehend von L-Prolin und katalysiert durch CouN 1 - 7, ist gut untersucht. Die Biosynthesevorstufen der zentralen Pyrroleinheit, andererseits, sind noch vollkommen unbekannt und keines der beteiligten Gene oder Enzyme wurden bisher identifiziert. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit erbringt nun den Nachweis, dass fünf Gene, couR 1 -couR 4, die sich in einem 4, 7 kb großen Abschnitt innerhalb des Coumermycin-Genclusters befinden, für die Biosynthese der zentralen Pyrroleinheit verantwortlich sind. Jedes dieser Gene wurde einzeln inaktiviert, was zu einer starken Reduzierung (wenigstens 92 %) oder sogar zum Ausfall der Coumermycin-produktion führte. Durch Fütterung der zentralen Pyrroleinheit, 3 -Methylpyrrol- 2, 4 -dicarbonsäure, konnte die Produktion dann teilweise wiederhergestellt werden. Eines der beteiligten Enzyme, und zwar CouR 3, zeigt Ähnlichkeit zu der Threoninkinase PduX aus Salmonella enterica und die Fütterung von O-Phospho-L-Threonin zu einer couR 3 -defekten Mutante führte zu einer leichten Produktionssteigerung im Vergleich zur Fütterung von L-Threonin (0, 197 mg/L vs. 0, 143 mg/L). Dies deutet darauf hin, dass der erste Schritt in der Biosynthese der zentralen Pyrroleinheit womöglich in der Phosphorylierung von L-Threonin besteht. Die Fütterung von [U- 13 C, 15 N]L-Threonin und die anschließende 13 C NMR-Analyse des resultierenden gelabelten Monoamids der zentralen Pyrroleinheit zeigen eindeutig, dass das intakte Threonin in diese Einheit eingebaut wird (Anreicherung 19 %) und dass es sowohl den heterozyklischen Stickstoff als auch vier der sieben Kohlenstoffatome liefert. Das bedeutet, dass die zentrale Pyrroleinheit von Coumermycin A 1 über einen neuen, bisher vollkommen unbekannten, Biosyntheseweg gebildet wird. Eine Hypothese für den Ablauf dieser Biosynthese, ausgehend von Threonin und Oxalacetat, wurde aufgestellt. Caprazamycine sind Liponukleosid-Antibiotika und werden zu den Translokase I-Inhibitoren gezählt. Sie werden von Streptomyces sp. MK 730 - 62 F 2 produziert und weisen eine sehr gute Wirksamkeit gegen Mykobakterien und anderen grampositive Mikroorganismen auf. Im dritten Teil dieser Arbeit wird eine HPLC/ESI-MS/MS-Methode für die Identifizierung von Caprazamycinen und Liposidomycinen, in Kulturextrakten der jeweiligen Produktionsstämme, vorgestellt. Beide Verbindungsklassen konnten sowohl bei positiver als auch bei negativer Ionisierung eindeutig identifiziert werden und der Vergleich der Fragmentierungsmuster zeigte mehrer charakteristische Produktionen. Diese lassen sich in zwei Klassen einteilen, je nachdem ob sie noch die Fettsäure-Seitenkette enthalten oder nicht. Produktionen denen die Fettsäure fehlt, sind charakteristisch für alle Caprazamycine bzw. Liposidomycine, und wurden daher für die Identifizierung von insgesamt sechs neuen Caprazamycinen herangezogen, welche wahrscheinlich ein- und zweifach ungesättigte Fettsäuren enthalten. Die vorgeschlagenen Summenformeln der neuen Verbindungen passen jeweils zu den Fettsäuren der Liposidomycine Y, Z, A, G, K und N. Außerdem wurde eine chromatographische Methode unter Verwendung eines Boronsäure-Gels, welche ursprünglich für die Aufreinigung von modifizierten Nukleosiden aus Zellkulturen verwendet wurde, für die teilweise Aufreinigung der Kulturextrakte angepasst...|$|E
30|$|Because {{of limited}} availability, costs and safety {{concerns}} related to blood transfusion, several strategies to reduce blood transfusions {{can be considered}} in addition to increasing transfusion trigger thresholds. These include approaches to reduce blood losses, for example use of antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and techniques of cell salvage during surgery; also, the use of small volume sample tubes can limit the blood losses related to sampling for laboratory studies. In a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials [87], subcutaneous administration of recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) in critically ill patients was shown {{to be associated with}} decreased transfusion rates, but this was not associated with improved mortality (except possibly in a subgroup of trauma patients [88]). Concerns also have been raised about potentially increased rates of deep vein thrombosis [88].

40|$|Hemoglobin (Hb) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein in whole blood. This fact implies that the oxygen binding and releasing function of Hb {{is the most}} vital for sustaining life. All Hb is compartmentalized in red blood cells (RBCs) with corpuscular Hb concentration of about 35 g/dL, covered with a thin biomembrane. In spite of its abundance, Hb sometimes shows toxicity once it is leaked from RBCs. The shielding effect of the RBC membrane is physiologically important. Based on this structural importance, we have studied artificial red cells (Hb vesicles, HbV) as <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers,</b> which encapsulate a purified and concentrated Hb solution in phospholipid vesicles, mimicking the cellular structure of RBCs. Our academic research consortium has clarified the safety and efficacy of this HbV, aiming at clinical applications.

40|$|Intravenous fluid {{administration}} is often required to counteract haemodynamic instability during emergency and elective surgeries, {{as well as}} in the intensive care unit. However, the best type and the amount of fluid required are controversial. A recent meta-analysis suggested that there is no difference among different types of colloids on outcome. Furthermore, colloids and crystalloids seem to be comparable in terms of efficiency in reverting haemodynamic instability, as well as morbidity and mortality. The interpretation of the results of different randomised controlled trials is somewhat difficult - the context must be always kept in mind. For example, results may differ in septic as compared to non-septic patient populations. Another important aspect concerns the effects on the macro- versus microcirculation. More recent studies emphasise that the microcirculation has to be taken into account when studying and interpreting the interaction between fluid therapy and the underlying disease. Nevertheless, the macrocirculation and clinical parameters have to be considered as well. Given that red blood cells remain the most important <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers,</b> recent evidence regarding blood age may stimulate new studies according to the actual range for blood storage. <b>Artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> may play a role in specific situations, where the transfusion is indicated but the access to blood is problematic, but there is doubt that they may replace blood transfusion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> (AOCs) can {{be abused}} by the athletes {{to improve their}} aerobic capacity. The AOCs produce a {{performance}} enhancing effect, especially in endurance sports. This article presents a method for the rapid screening of hemoglobin-based <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> (HBOCs) in blood samples. Common screening tests to reveal HBOC misuse by athletes are based on colorimetric detection since HBOC use causes discoloration of the plasma. In this communication we are presenting a different approach for HBOC detection using an hematological analyzer capable of measuring hemoglobin by two methods: a standard cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric method to calculate the amount of total hemoglobin (HGBtot) and a flow cytometric optical method to calculate the amount of hemoglobin within the red blood cells (HGBcell). Thanks to this dual contemporary hemoglobin measurement, the HGBdelta value (corresponding to free HGB) is automatically calculated by subtraction of HGBcell from HGBtot {{and can be used}} as a fast screening index of HBOC abuse. We tested the effectiveness of this approach using 68 normal blood samples with different basal HGB values fortified with three different HBOCs at varying concentrations. We evaluated the performance of the method by calculating the correlation between HGBcell and HGBtot values in normal samples. Finally we used a simple statistical approach to calculate a reliable HGBdelta cut-off value (0. 35 g/dL) as a limit of decision to discriminate between a clear negative sample and a suspect sample to submit to a confirmation analysis.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} pre-eclampsia are being increasingly clarified in animals and humans. With the uncovering of these mechanisms, preventive therapy strategies using chronic infusion of adrenomedullin, vascular endothelial growth factor- 121 (VEGF- 121), losartan, and sildenafil {{have been proposed}} to block narrow spiral artery formation in the placenta by suppressing related possible factors for pre-eclampsia. However, although such preventive treatments have been partly successful, they have failed in ameliorating fetal growth restriction and carry the risk of possible side-effects of drugs on pregnant mothers. In this study, we attempted {{to develop a new}} symptomatic treatment for pre-eclampsia by directly rescuing placental ischemia with <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> (hemoglobin vesicles: HbV) since previous data indicate that placental ischemia/hypoxia may alone be sufficient to lead to pre-eclampsia through up-regulation of sFlt- 1, one of the main candidate molecules for the cause of pre-eclampsia. Using a rat model, the present study demonstrated that a simple treatment using hemoglobin vesicles for placental ischemia rescues placental and fetal hypoxia, leading to appropriate fetal growth. The present study is the first to demonstrate hemoglobin vesicles successfully decreasing maternal plasma levels of sFlt- 1 and ameliorating fetal growth restriction in the pre-eclampsia rat model (p < 0. 05, one-way ANOVA).

Interest in precise oxygen control for in vitro cultures of tissues and cells continues to grow, especially with the emergence of the organ-on-a-chip and the desire to emulate in vivo conditions. This was recently discussed in this journal in a Critical Review by Brennan et al. (Lab Chip (2014). DOI: 10. 1039 /C 4 LC 00853 G). Microfluidics can be used to introduce flow to facilitate nutrient supply to and waste removal from in vitro culture systems. Well-defined oxygen gradients can also be established. However, cells can quickly alter the oxygen balance in their vicinity. In this Tutorial Review, we expand on the Brennan paper to focus on the implementation of oxygen analysis in these systems to achieve continuous monitoring. Both electrochemical and optical approaches for the integration of oxygen monitoring in microfluidic tissue and cell culture systems will be discussed.

The aim {{of this study was to}} target primary wound healing and survival in critically ischemic skin by the systemic application of left-shifted liposomal hemoglobin vesicles (HbVs). This was tested in bilateral, cranially based dorsal skin flaps in mice treated with a HbV solution with an oxygen affinity that was increased to a P(50) (partial oxygen tension at which the hemoglobin becomes 50 % saturated with oxygen) of 9 mmHg. Twenty percent of the total blood volume of the HbV solution was injected immediately and 24 h after surgery. On the first postoperative day, oxygen saturation in the critically ischemic middle flap portions was increased from 23 % (untreated control) to 39 % in the HbV-treated animals (P < 0. 05). Six days postoperatively, flap tissue survival was increased from 33 % (control) to 57 % (P < 0. 01) and primary healing of the ischemic wound margins from 6. 6 to 12. 7 mm (P < 0. 05) after HbV injection. In addition, higher capillary counts and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression (both P < 0. 01) were found in the immunostained flap tissue. We conclude that left-shifted HbVs may ameliorate the survival and primary wound healing in critically ischemic skin, possibly mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase-induced neovascularization...|$|R
