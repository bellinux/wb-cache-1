5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (<b>antivirus</b> <b>software)</b> might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Benchmarking {{conducted}} by PassMark Software highlights the 2009 version's 52 second install time, 32 second scan time, and 7 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating <b>antivirus</b> <b>software.</b> Tests {{were conducted in}} Windows Vista running on a dual core processor.

5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an <b>antivirus</b> <b>software</b> (AV) {{product that}} {{provides}} protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses. Before version 4.5, MSE ran on , Windows Vista and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later, which have built-in AV components. MSE 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product free of charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 protected users from only adware and spyware.|$|E

It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E

25|$|Since {{patching}} the kernel {{is technically}} permitted in 32-bit (x86) editions of Windows, several <b>antivirus</b> <b>software</b> developers use kernel patching to implement antivirus and other security services.

50|$|A cyberheist {{is a type}} of {{computer}} crime committed by cyber criminals. Recently observed cyberheists have become more and more sophisticated. These attacks have been promulgated on enterprises through the use of phishing that targets employees with access to their computer systems. Using such attacks cybercriminals can bypass the <b>antivirus</b> security <b>software</b> and use social engineering to coax information out of their victim or they can simply wait for the employees to click on something in their computers. When employees click on something in their computers, the criminals get access to the computers. They then hack into the network and put keyloggers on accounting systems. In time the cybercriminals are able to obtain password and keys information. An organization’s bank accounts can then be accessed via the information they have stolen using the keyloggers.|$|R
50|$|In Microsoft computer-systems, the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) {{comprises}} a set {{of system}} services and an application programming interface first introduced with Windows Vista in 2006/2007. It allows applications to tie into the packet processing and filtering pipeline of the Next Generation TCP/IP network stack. It provides features such as integrated communication, and administrators can configure it to invoke processing logic on a per-application basis. Microsoft intended WFP for use by firewalls and by other packet-processing or connection-monitoring components, such as <b>antivirus</b> and antimalware <b>software</b> and parental controls. Additionally, WFP is used to implement NAT and to store IPSec policy configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Real-time {{protection}} from malware works identically to real-time <b>antivirus</b> protection: the <b>software</b> scans disk files at download time, and blocks {{the activity of}} components known to represent malware. In some cases, it may also intercept attempts to install start-up items or to modify browser settings. Because many malware components are installed {{as a result of}} browser exploits or user error, using security software (some of which are anti-malware, though many are not) to [...] "sandbox" [...] browsers (essentially isolate the browser from the computer and hence any malware induced change) can also be effective in helping to restrict any damage done.|$|R
25|$|A {{rescue disk}} that is bootable, {{such as a}} CD or USB storage device, {{can be used to}} run <b>antivirus</b> <b>software</b> outside of the {{installed}} operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant.

The AVG Rescue CD software can also be installed onto a USB storage device, that is bootable on newer computers.|$|E

5000|$|A {{senior analyst}} at the Burton Group {{research}} firm recommends {{that the best way}} to ensure data will not be tampered with is to not store it on the client device (mobile device). As such, there is no local copy to lose if the mobile device is stolen and the data can reside on servers within the data center with access permitted only over the network. [...] Most smartphone manufacturers provide a complete set of security features including full-disk encryption, email encryption, as well as remote management which includes the ability to wipe contents if device is lost or stolen. Also, some devices have embedded third-party <b>antivirus</b> and firewall <b>software</b> such as RIM's BlackBerry.|$|R
50|$|The infrastructure, the users, and the {{services}} offered on computer networks today are all {{subject to a}} wide variety of risks posed by threats that include distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of various kinds, eavesdropping, hacking, phishing, worms, viruses, spams, etc. In order to counter the risk posed by these threats, network users have traditionally resorted to <b>antivirus</b> and anti-spam <b>software,</b> firewalls, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs), and other add-ons to reduce the likelihood of being affected by threats. In practice, a large industry (companies like Symantec, McAfee, etc.) as well as considerable research efforts are currently centered around developing and deploying tools and techniques to detect threats and anomalies in order to protect the cyber infrastructure and its users from the resulting negative impact of the anomalies.|$|R
50|$|Technically {{inclined}} {{users and}} computer security professionals found that XCP contains a rootkit component.

XCP's efforts to cloak itself unfortunately allowed writers of malware to amplify the damage done by their software, hiding the malware under XCP's cloak if XCP had been installed on the victim's machine. Several publishers of <b>antivirus</b> and anti-spyware <b>software</b> updated their products to detect and remove XCP if found, on the grounds that it is a trojan horse or other malware; and an assistant secretary for the United States' Department of Homeland Security chastised companies that would cause security holes on customers' computers, reminding the companies that they do not own the computers.|$|R
