5|$|During the 1988 {{legislative}} session, Governor Wilkinson {{proposed an}} amendment to the Kentucky Constitution that would allow state officials, including the sitting incumbents, to succeed themselves in office once. As presiding officer in the Senate, Jones insisted that any such measure also include a runoff provision if a candidate did not receive a majority of votes in the party primary. Wilkinson opposed this provision, and the measure died in the state senate. Wilkinson's proposed education program also failed in the session, and Jones suggested that the governor should build <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>among</b> legislators before including the program on the agenda of a special legislative session, which Wilkinson had proposed for January 1989. After the 1988 session, Wilkinson called Jones a backstabber and accused him of sabotaging the succession amendment. The two did not meet for six months following the session.|$|E

5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>among</b> astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>among</b> repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{published}} energy-related studies which conclude that energy efficiency programs and renewable power technologies are a better energy option than nuclear power plants.

25|$|Herbst notes {{a modern}} paradox {{regarding}} the colonial borders in Africa: {{while they are}} arbitrary there is <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>among</b> African leaders {{that they must be}} maintained.

This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.|$|E

25|$|One {{implication}} of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point is counter-productive for raising further tax revenue. A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are controversial. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%. There is <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>among</b> leading economists that {{a reduction in the}} US federal income tax rate would not raise annual total tax revenue.|$|E

25|$|The Kingdom of Thailand {{occupied}} a delicate position during the Second Indochina War.

As a result, there was <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>among</b> Thais that communist encroachment should be stopped short of Thai territory.
