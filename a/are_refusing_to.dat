25|$|In January 2002, Bush {{signed the}} No Child Left Behind Act, with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as chief sponsor, {{which aims to}} close the {{achievement}} gap, measures student performance, provides options to parents with children in low-performing schools, and targets more federal funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator John Kerry and the National Education Association, say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said that the Department of Education's overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005.

2500|$|The Union of Towns and Organizations of Guerrero (UPOEG), {{along with}} activists, {{parents of the}} missing students, and other drug war victims from {{different}} parts of Mexico, organized and led a search in Iguala on November 23 to uncover more bodies buried in the municipality's clandestine mass graves. They uncovered seven bodies in mass graves at a rural community known as La Laguna. The purpose of the search was to locate mass graves for federal authorities to investigate. [...] "We are doing the job authorities <b>are</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> do", one of the activists said. Locals stated that members of organized crime frequented the area to bury people around there. The following day, the PGR arrived at Iguala to recover the bodies and investigate them. They planned to further their investigations on the mass graves found by the UPOEG. Those present told federal authorities to not allow local officials to intervene in the case. The UPOEG announced that they would be leading a committee to uncover more mass graves in Guerrero. Bruno Plácido Valerio, the leader of the group, stated that from January 2013 to November 2014, at least 500 bodies were located between Ayutla and Iguala. He believes that there are more bodies buried in mass graves all across the state.|$|E

2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships {{the way they want}} to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy is said to be [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of us are not, and more and more <b>are</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E
