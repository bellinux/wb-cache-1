50|$|The {{concentration}} of carbonate {{in the water}} which is {{in contact with the}} used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion, because uranium(VI) forms soluble <b>anionic</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>complexes</b> such as UO2(CO3)22− and UO2(CO3)34−. When carbonate ions are absent, and the water is not strongly acidic, the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of uranium dioxide often form insoluble hydrated uranium trioxide phases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{sorption}} of U and Ra on {{finely ground}} biotite, muscovite, and phlogopite was adequately {{described by the}} Freundlicb adsorption equation, (x/m) = KC n, at low U and Ra concentrations despite Ra precipitation at the higher temperature. Radium and U sorption-efficiency urves derived from the Freundlich constants generally showed decreased istribution coefficients in response to increasing lem-perature and increasing Ra or U concentrations. Temperatures investigated were 5 ~ 25 ~ and 65 ~ Solution compositions used were 0. 1 M NaC 1 and 0. 01 M NaHCO 3 for U, and 0. 01 M NaC 1 for Ra. Uranium initial solution concenlrations ranged from 1. 00 • 10 4 M to 4. 00 • 10 7 M; the Ra initial solution concentration range was 6. 80 • 10 - 7 M to 8. 60 • 10 9 M. In 0. 01 M NaHCO 3 solutions, <b>anionic</b> uranyl <b>carbonate</b> <b>complexes</b> were prevalent, {{and because they are}} weakly sorbed relative to free uranyl ion and uranyl hydroxy complexes, the result was a relatively low U sorption efficiency on biotite and phlogopite and excellent sorption efficiency on muscovite.

40|$|We used crushed-rock columns {{to study}} the {{sorption}} retardation of neptunium by zeolitic, devitrified, and vitric tuffs typical of those {{at the site of}} the potential high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. We used two sodium bicarbonate waters (groundwater from Well J- 13 at the site and water prepared to simulate groundwater from Well UE- 25 p No. 1) under oxidizing conditions. It was found that values of the sorption distribution coefficient, Kd, obtained from these column experiments under flowing conditions, regardless of the water or the water velocity used, agreed well with those obtained earlier from batch sorption experiments under static conditions. The batch sorption distribution coefficient can be used to predict the arrival time for neptunium eluted through the columns. On the other hand, the elution curves showed dispersivity, which implies that neptunium sorption in these tuffs may be nonlinear, irreversible, or noninstantaneous. As a result, use of a batch sorption distribution coefficient to calculate neptunium transport through Yucca Mountain tuffs would yield conservative values for neptunium release from the site. We also noted that neptunium (present as the <b>anionic</b> neptunyl <b>carbonate</b> <b>complex)</b> never eluted prior to tritiated water, which implies that charge exclusion does not appear to exclude neptunium from the tuff pores. The column experiments corroborated the trends observed in batch sorption experiments: neptunium sorption onto devitrified and vitric tuffs is minimal and sorption onto zeolitic tuffs decreases as the amount of sodium and bicarbonate/carbonate in the water increases...|$|R
30|$|Uranium as {{hexavalent}} {{state is}} the thermodynamically stable in oxic groundwater and interacts strongly with solid phases. The transport of uranium in the groundwater is governed by its interactions with adsorbed phases {{and a variety of}} sorption reactions are involved in the dynamic of uranium in soil. The increase in U(VI) adsorption onto soil from acidic to near neutral pH values is a consequence of the dominant U(VI) aqueous species being cationic and neutral over this pH range. However, the subsequent decrease in U(VI) adsorption with increasing basic pH values results from the dominant U(VI) aqueous species being <b>anionic</b> U(VI) <b>carbonate</b> <b>complexes</b> (Tripathi 1984, Hsi and Langmuir, 1985, Waite et al. 1994, McKinley et al. 1995, Turner et al. 1996). In the absence of dissolved carbonate, uranium sorption to iron oxide and clay minerals {{has been shown to be}} extensive and remain at a maximum at pH values near and above neutral pH (Hsi and Langmuir 1985). However, in the presence of carbonate and organic complexants, U(VI) adsorption has been shown to be substantially reduced or inhibited. Even differences in partial pressures of CO 2 have a major effect on uranium adsorption at neutral pH conditions. Waite et al. (1994), showed that the percent of U(VI) adsorbed onto ferrihydrite decreases from 97 to 38 % when CO 2 is increased from ambient (0.03 %) to elevated (1 %) partial pressures. Kaplan and Serne (1995) noted that U (VI) adsorption typically increases with increasing ionic strength of an oxidized aqueous solution. The presence of increasing concentrations of other dissolved ions, such as Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K+ will displace the U (VI) ions adsorbed onto mineral surface sites and release U(VI) into the aqueous solution. Therefore, the mobility of U(VI) is expected to increase in high ionic-strength solutions.|$|R

Speciation study of metals in sediment provides information on the potential availability of metals (toxic) to biota under various environmental conditions.

The present study focuses on Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon. Earlier studies focused only on total metal concentrations in sediment and water. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine metal speciation (Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd) in the (operationally defined) sediment chemical fractions and metal speciation in reservoir water. This would reflect on metal bioavailability and toxicity. Water samples and bed sediments were collected from nine sites during the dry season and a sequential chemical fraction scheme was applied to the < 75 -μm sieve sediment fraction. Metal content in each fraction was determined by the FAAS technique. The data showed that the highest percentages of total metal content in sediment fractions were for: Fe in residual followed by reducible, Cr and Ni in residual and in reducible, Cu in organic followed by exchangeable, Zn in residual and in organic, Pb in organic and carbonate, Cd was mainly in carbonate. Total metal content in water was determined by ICP-MS technique and aqueous metal speciation was predicted using AQUACHEM software interfaced to PHREEQC geochemical computer model.
