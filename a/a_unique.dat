40|$|In a {{previous}} preprint, [2], reproduced here within the appendix in its revised version, we were confronted, {{to reach the}} validity of the second law of thermodynamics for <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> collapse of <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> quantum object, to the necessity of an ensemble of mea- sures to be accomplished within copies of identical isolated systems. The validity of the second law of thermodynamics {{within the context of the}} wave function collapse was sustained by the large number of microstates related to a given collapsed state. Now, we will consider just one pure initial state containing just one initial state of the quan- tum subsystem, not an ensemble of identically prepared initial quantum subsystems, e. g., just one photon from a very low intensity beam prepared with an equiprobable eigenset containing two elements, <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> observation raising two likelihood out- comes. Again, we will show the statistical interpretation must prevail, albeit the quan- tum subsystem being <b>a</b> singular, <b>unique,</b> pure state element within its unitary quantum subsystem ensemble set.

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> embedding, and therefore also <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
