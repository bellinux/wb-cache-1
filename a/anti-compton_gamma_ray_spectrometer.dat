40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe expected {{response of the}} Lunar Prospector's <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> instrument was predicted using a Monte Carlo simulation. The full lunar spectrum was generated using 90 lines and a continuum <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> background taken from Apollo 15 and 16 data. The Monte Carlo program uses the exact dimensions and composition of the <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> in order to most accurately predict spectral performance, assuming an operating temperature on orbit of - 30 degrees Celsius. The <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> will be launched aboard the Lunar Prospector spacecraft on October 24, 1997. The Lunar Prospector will assume a 100 km altitude orbit around the moon, allowing the <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> to map the elemental composition of the surface. The simulated <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> response {{can be used as}} a comparison for the actual data in order to determine how well the spectrometer is working[URL] United States Arm...|$|R

40|$|The Mars Observer <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{will return}} data {{related to the}} {{elemental}} composition of Mars. The instrument has both a <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and several neutron detectors. The <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> will return a spectrum nominally every 20 s from Mars permitting {{a map of the}} elemental abundances to be made. The <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> are emitted from nuclei involved in radioactive decay, from nuclei formed by capture of a thermal neutron, and from nuclei put in an excited state by a fast-neutron interaction. The <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> come from an average depth of the order of a few tens of centimeters. The spectrum will show sharp emission lines whose intensity determines the concentration of the element and whose energy identifies the element. The neutron detectors, using the fact that the orbital velocity of the Mars Observer spacecraft is similar to the velocity of thermal neutrons, determine both the thermal and epithermal neutron flux. By combining the results from both techniques it is possible to map the depth dependence of hydrogen in the upper meter as well. These data permit a variety of Martian geoscience problems to be addressed including the crust and mantle composition, weathering processes, volcanism, and the volatile reservoirs and processes...|$|R

40|$|The HEAO- 3 <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> has {{provided}} evidence {{in the quest for}} the understanding of complex element formation in the universe with the discovery of Al- 26 in the interstellar medium. It has demonstrated that the synthesis of intermediate mass nuclei is currently going on in the galaxy. This discovery was confirmed by the Solar Maximum Mission. The flux is peaked near the galactic center and indicates about 3 solar masses of Al- 26 in the interstellar medium, with an implied ratio of Al- 26 /Al- 27 =. 00001. Several possible distributions were studied but the data gathered thus far do not allow discrimination between them. It is felt that only the spaceflight of a high resolution <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> with adequate sensitivity will ultimately resolve the issue of the source of this material...|$|R
