Such Bogoliubov transformations frequently appear in the context of quantum optics. We provide a set of instructions for computing the quantum Fisher information for arbitrary pure initial states. We show that the maximally achievable precision of estimation is inversely proportional to the squared average particle number and that such Heisenberg scaling requires non-classical, but not necessarily entangled states. Our method further allows us to quantify losses in precision arising from being able to monitor only finitely many modes, for which we identify a lower bound.

A choking horn is a family of cycles on an algebraic variety with the property that the cycles cannot be boundaries of nearby chains. The presence of choking horns is an obstruction to metric conicalness and the authors use this to prove that some classical isolated hypersurface singularities are not metrically conical. They also show that there exist countably infinitely many singular varieties, which are locally homeomorphic, but not locally subanalytically bi-Lipschitz equivalent with respect to the inner metric.

30|$|Instead of {{matching}} {{both types of}} plants on all establishment characteristics, it is instructive to have {{a closer look at}} those characteristics likely to drive the marked reduction in the difference of the unexplained gender pay gaps across owner-run and manager-run plants. As Table  1 documents, the most obvious difference between both types is plant size—with manager-run plants being more than nine times as large as owner-run in West Germany and more than five times as large in East Germany. To gauge the importance of plant size for our findings, we also re-did our analysis for matched samples where matching is on plant size only (using the same matching procedure as described above) the results of which are given in Table  6 in the <b>Appendix.</b> For <b>West</b> Germany the difference in the unexplained gaps is reduced by 26  per cent to 9.1 log points, while for East Germany the reduction amounts to 45  per cent leaving a difference of 5.5 log points. While this suggests that plant size is an important determinant of workers’ self selection, other factors seem to be important as well and matching on all establishment characteristics is necessary to minimise selection effects.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{announce}} {{the existence of}} a family of new $ 2 $-variable polynomial invariants for oriented classical links defined via a Markov trace on the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra of type $A$. Yokonuma-Hecke algebras are generalizations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and this family contains the Homflypt polynomial, the famous $ 2 $-variable invariant for classical links arising from the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type $A$. We show that these invariants are topologically equivalent to the Homflypt polynomial on knots, but not on links, by providing pairs of Homflypt-equivalent links that are distinguished by our invariants. In order to do this, we prove that our invariants can be defined diagrammatically via a special skein relation involving only crossings between different components. We further generalize this family of invariants to a new $ 3 $-variable skein link invariant which is stronger than the Homflypt polynomial. Finally, we present a closed formula for this invariant, by W. B. R. Lickorish, which uses Homflypt polynomials of sublinks and linking numbers of a given oriented link.

[...] Department of Psychology. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Mental illness (MI) stigma {{is considered a}} primary barrier to seeking and remaining in treatment. Mental health experts argue that directly targeting persons with MI {{in an effort to}} reduce gun violence may increase public stigma via further associating MI with dangerousness and increasing public preferences for social distance. The present study experimentally investigated whether firearm laws targeting persons with MI who are considered to be a ‘clear and present danger’ to themselves and others can increase MI stigma (i. e., dangerousness, social distance) and ultimately decrease treatment-seeking intentions among college students. Examining mental health reporting practices imposed by such laws poses important questions about their influence on whether people are less likely to seek necessary treatments pending personal distress. The empirical evidence from a variety of research studies largely does not support the effectiveness of these laws. The current study differs from previous research by directly exposing participants to how these reporting provisions impact limits to confidentiality in the therapy process to determine whether they influence differences in treatment-seeking intentions and MI stigma. Additionally, this study examined whether perceived dangerousness and preference for social distance mediate the relationships between exposure to these reporting provisions and treatment-seeking intention. Two-hundred and twenty-nine undergraduate students were randomly-assigned by gender to read a therapy consent form containing clear and present danger reporting laws (CPD) or a standard therapy consent without these laws (control). Participants then completed measures of treatment-seeking intentions, perceived dangerousness, and preference for social distance. Contrary to hypotheses, perceived dangerousness, preference for social distance, and treatment-seeking intentions did not differ between the CPD and control conditions. Furthermore, dangerousness and social distance did not mediate the relationship between CPD conditions and intention to seek treatment. Findings do not support concerns that firearm laws directly targeting MI populations may increase stigma and decrease treatment-seeking intentions. Implications for MI populations, future research, and CPD laws are discussed. Overview [...] Review of the literature [...] Methodology [...] Results [...] Discussion [...] Appendix A.

40|$|Let D be a simply laced Dynkin {{diagram of}} rank r whose affinization has {{the shape of}} a star (i. e., D 4,E 6,E 7,E 8). To such a diagram one can attach a group G whose {{generators}} correspond to the legs of the affinization, have orders equal to the leg lengths plus 1, and the product of the generators is 1. The group G is then a 2 -dimensional crystallographic group: G=Z_l Z^ 2, where l is 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively. In this paper, we define a flat deformation H(t,q) of the group algebra C[G] of this group, by replacing the relations saying that the generators have prescribed orders by their deformations, saying that the generators satisfy monic polynomial equations of these orders with arbitrary roots (which are deformation parameters). The algebra H(t,q) for D 4 is the Cherednik algebra of type C^Č_ 1, which was studied by Noumi, Sahi, and Stokman, and controls Askey-Wilson polynomials. We prove that H(t,q) is the universal deformation of the twisted group algebra of G, and that this deformation is compatible with certain filtrations on C[G]. We also show that if q is a root of unity, then for generic t the algebra H(t,q) is an Azumaya algebra, and its center is the function algebra on an affine del Pezzo surface. For generic q, the spherical subalgebra eH(t,q) e provides a quantization of such surfaces. We also discuss connections of H(t,q) with preprojective algebras and Painlevé VI.

Building on the solid foundation {{established by the}} Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) in the report "Public Health Confronts the Mosquito: Developing Sustainable State and Local Mosquito Control Programs", this document provides analysis and recommendations for countering the threat of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks in five sections: Plan Ahead, Involve Others, Use the Best Science and Data, Inform the Public, Responding to a Mosquito-Borne Epidemic Emergency. While emergencies can be extremely challenging, careful planning may avert many difficulties. Mosquito control programs simply cannot respond effectively to exotic diseases, existing pathogens or natural disasters if thorough, deliberate and evidence-based preparation is absent. At the same time, this document provides recommendations for mosquito control in areas with limited resources or a reduced response capacity.

40|$|We {{consider}} the statistical properties over disordered {{samples of the}} overlap distribution P_ J(q) which {{plays the role of}} an order parameter in spin-glasses. We show that near zero temperature (i) the typical overlap distribution is exponentially small in the central region of - 1 <q< 1 : P^typ(q) = e^P̅_̅ ̅J̅(̅q̅) ̅∼ e^- β N^θϕ(q), where θ is the droplet exponent defined here with respect to the total number N of spins (in order to consider also fully connected models where the notion of length does not exist); (ii) the rescaled variable v = - (P_ J(q)) /N^θ remains an O(1) random positive variable describing sample-to sample fluctuations; (iii) the averaged distribution P̅_̅ ̅J̅(̅q̅) ̅ is non-typical and dominated by rare anomalous samples. Similar statements hold for the cumulative overlap distribution I_ J(q_ 0) ≡∫_ 0 ^q_ 0 dq P_ J(q). These results are derived explicitly for the spherical mean-field model with θ= 1 / 3, ϕ(q) = 1 -q^ 2, and the random variable v corresponds to the rescaled difference between the two largest eigenvalues of GOE random matrices. Then we compare numerically the typical and averaged overlap distributions for the long-ranged one-dimensional Ising spin-glass with random couplings decaying as J(r) ∝ r^-σ for various values of the exponent σ, corresponding to various droplet exponents θ(σ), and for the mean-field SK-model (corresponding formally to the σ= 0 limit of the previous model). Our conclusion is that future studies on spin-glasses should measure the typical values of the overlap distribution or of the cumulative overlap distribution to obtain clearer conclusions {{on the nature of the}} spin-glass phase.
