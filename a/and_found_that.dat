A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.

5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship.

5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas {{found that the}} primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{it was much more}} likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.|$|E

5|$|A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 {{showed that}} 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams' Progressive Conservatives. His {{popularity}} {{had been in}} the seventies according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009. Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, the first of which was by Global News and Ipsos and the second was by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams' performance, the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall with 58 percent.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|Ball {{then took}} leave in England. His feats in France had {{received}} considerable publicity. He {{was the first}} British ace to become a household name, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> his celebrity was such {{that he could not}} walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements {{had a profound impact on}} budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{repeated}} efforts, the French Navy {{failed to}} reinforce and resupply the garrison, as their ships were intercepted and defeated either in European waters {{or in the}} Caribbean itself. The British had intercepted {{a number of these}} messages, and launched a series of successful invasions during 1809, until Guadeloupe was the only French colony remaining. A British expeditionary force landed on 28 January 1810, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> much of the island's militia garrison had deserted. Advancing from two landing beaches {{on opposite sides of the}} island, they were able to rapidly push inland. It was not until they reached Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge outside the capital Basse-Terre that the expeditionary force faced strong opposition, but in a battle lasting for most of 3 February, the French were defeated and driven back. The island's commander, Jean Augustin Ernouf, began surrender negotiations the following day.|$|E
