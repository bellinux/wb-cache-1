5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> threatening as possible.|$|E
25|$|Lead glass also {{occurs in}} Han-period China (206 BC – 220 AD). There, it was cast to imitate jade, both for ritual objects such <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> small figures, {{as well as}} {{jewellery}} and a limited range of vessels. Since glass first occurs at such a late date in China, {{it is thought that}} the technology was brought along the Silk Road by glassworkers from the Middle East. The fundamental compositional difference between Western silica-natron glass and the unique Chinese lead glass, however, may indicate an autonomous development.|$|E
5000|$|The {{grammatical}} category {{associated with}} comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. [...] The usual degrees of comparison are the positive, which simply denotes a property (as with the English words <b>big</b> <b>and</b> fully); the comparative, which indicates greater degree (<b>as</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> more fully); and the superlative, which indicates greatest degree (<b>as</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>and</b> most fully). Some languages have forms indicating {{a very large}} degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. beautiful, less beautiful, least beautiful.|$|R

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} attacks on Rockefeller and his firm was the 1904 publication of The History of the Standard Oil Company, by Ida Tarbell, a leading muckraker. She documented the company's espionage, price wars, heavy-handed marketing tactics, and courtroom evasions. Although her work prompted a huge backlash against the company, Tarbell stated she was surprised at its magnitude. [...] "I never had an animus against their size and wealth, never objected to their corporate form. I was willing that they should combine and grow <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> wealthy as they could, but only by legitimate means. But they had never played fair, and that ruined their greatness for me." [...] Tarbell's father had been driven out of the oil business during the [...] "South Improvement Company" [...] affair.|$|E

[...] Amos Barshad of New York stated the video [...] "is awe-inspiring in almost exactly the way it intended to be" [...] and that [...] "the spirit of the song, {{as reflected in the}} video, is that of free will and dream fulfillment {{in the face of a}} repressive society." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented that [...] "Britney displays the sass and charm fans fell in love with a decade ago during performance shots, where she flirts with the camera, her eyes <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> wide as her smile." [...] An editor for VH1 called the video [...] "fan-freakin'-tastic" [...] and compared it favorably to the music video for Katy Perry's [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2011), saying that [...] "they share a silly temperament, a flirty star, and funny cameos. Upon closer examination, though, Britney's video blows Katy Perry's out of the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friend Danny Hutton {{highlighted}} Brian's studio proficiency, citing what {{he believed}} to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, [...] "Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There {{was a lot of}} subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just – whoa! – got twice <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> fat." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by David Arnold, {{played by the}} Sinfonia of London and conducted by Nicholas Dodd. It was the second motion picture Arnold had composed and the first major motion picture. At the time of production, Arnold had recently started {{to work in a}} local video store in London. Once hired, he spent several months in a hotel room working on the soundtrack, spending more time rewriting the music and improving it as delays were being created due to film companies trying to get the rights to distribution. According to Arnold [...] "when I first read the script for StarGate, I knew what approach to take, which was to be <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> bold as possible," [...] he kept on saying: [...] "Every time there was an amazing sight, the characters would stand back and say, 'Oh my God!' But James would just smile and walk towards it. That was the basis for the Stargate score, moving forward with a sense of majesty instead of being frightened by what's around the corner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Players {{navigate}} the open world, fictional city of Stilwater. The city consists of forty-five neighborhoods divided between twenty districts. It is expanded from Saints Rows version of Stilwater, roughly one-and-a-half times <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> featuring new districts {{such as the}} prison, nuclear power plant, and expanded airport among others. Game developers stated that the city has very much been redeveloped and each individual neighborhood has been touched up {{in one way or}} another. According to the storyline, the in-game corporation Ultor spent more than three-hundred million dollars redeveloping the city, funding the police force and, as it states, turning the [...] "once crime-ridden third-tier city" [...] into an [...] "urban utopia". The Saints Row district is a more notable change within the city, having been completely redesigned and serving as the location of Ultor's headquarters; a towering skyscraper referred to as the Phillips Building. Many old districts from the earlier revision of Stilwater have also seen changes. Examples include the expansion taken place on the Suburbs district, which is double the size of its depiction in Saints Row and the Museum district, which features the Eramenos Ancient Greek museum exhibit, complete with models of the Acropolis of Athens and Theatre of Dionysus. There are also several completely new districts, such as the Marina and the University.|$|E
