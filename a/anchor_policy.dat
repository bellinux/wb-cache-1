There {{is a lack of}} accurate quantitative tools to define the strategy used, then a dummy variable (fixed or floating rate) is generally used in econometric studies. This paper tries to provide an indicator to measure the trade-off between nominal anchor and real target strategies in open economies. Unlike traditional dummies, it allows for a mixed strategy (generally observed) in the management of the exchange rate, according to external and internal constraints. The analysis of Poland's exchange policy since 1990 shows this trade-off, since monetary authorities have softened their nominal <b>anchor</b> <b>policy</b> to avoid excessive real appreciation. An econometric estimation of Polish inflation is used to test the validity of the indicator suggested. The results confirm not only the classical determinants of inflation, but also the validity of our mixed exchange policy indicator...|$|E

Furthermore, the goal is to show that {{the results of this study}} provide the economic policy with a guidance to the consistent and direct answer on relevant issues in resolving the undesired state of economy. This includes other issues relevant for the society as well. The achievement of these goals is feasible by scientific method of analysis incorporated by activities of economic policy based on fundaments of modern theory. This refers to its fiscal and monetary content in particular and their modern pragmatism. The results of the research show that the causes of recession and economic crisis in Croatia only partly refer to the external origin, and are dominated by internal factors. Among those factors the crucial one is the application of the so called “stabilization program” in 1993 and related policy of overvalued and stable exchange rate. The main conclusion of the research is that it is necessary to abandon the neoliberal concept of economic policy and its monetarist content (<b>anchor</b> <b>policy).</b> Without such an action it is not possible to stop recession and direct production towards recovery...|$|E

30|$|Inflation {{targeting}} {{has been}} widely adopted in Latin America. In this paper, we show evidence consistent with major beneficial effects from so doing, with falling term premia and <b>anchored</b> <b>policy</b> rate expectations. To do this we construct term premia estimates using the method suggested by Adrian et al. (2013) for selected inflation targeting Latin American economies. They use synthetic prices constructed from estimated yield curves to derive holding-period excess returns and condition on the principal components of the yields. This approach is extremely easy to implement and fast to calculate. We detect a small drop in interest rate expectations since the global financial crisis but longer term rates seem remarkably well anchored. There is also relatively low correlation between our estimated Latin American and US term premia.|$|R

Nevertheless, this literature tends to view the <b>anchoring</b> of <b>policy</b> reform as an exogenously given option for a reforming country. We demonstrate that anchoring is an endogenously determined choice, which may guarantee neither optimal levels of policy reform nor effective anchoring unless the relevant contracts are both complete and incentive compatible. We examine the economic pillar of the Euro-Med Partnership (EMP) to ascertain {{the extent to which}} its contractual provisions satisfy these conditions. Our findings suggest that the EMP leaves too much room for discretion and does not internalize the positive externalities associated with policy reform. These findings enable us to elaborate on why the EU cannot be expected to function as an effective <b>anchor</b> for <b>policy</b> reform for its trading partners...|$|R

The challenges that coastal policy faces, {{the frequency with}} which pilot {{projects are}} implemented, and the criticisms regarding their efficacy make it interesting and relevant to study pilot projects in this policy field. This dissertation on ‘Narrative perspectives on the development of coastal pilot projects’ aims to deepen understanding of the development of pilot projects in their actor-networks. It utilises the concept of narratives both in the conceptualisation of the development of pilot projects and in the design of a research strategy, choosing to learn from the experiences of actors involved in coastal pilot projects. The Sand Engine in the Netherlands and Ystad’s sand nourishment project in Scania, Sweden, are the two coastal pilot projects from which empirical data are drawn. Retrospective biographies of the Sand Engine pilot project, and the narrative competitions active in both the Sand Engine and Ystad cases were identified using deductive and inductive narrative analysis methods. This thesis highlights that pilot projects function not only as learning instruments for understanding the (bio) physical system, but also as instruments where actor-based learning is storified and success can be claimed and institutionally <b>anchored.</b> <b>Policy</b> Analysi...|$|R
40|$|The long lasting, but {{externally}} financed {{boom in the}} new EU {{countries has}} collapsed under the impacts of the global financial crisis. The countries’ fiscal and monetary authorizes {{do not seem to}} be able to effectively resist – a deep crisis is under way. The situation is particularly dramatic in the Baltic countries, where the hands of the monetary authority are institutionally tied, and an expansionary fiscal policy would trigger off speculative attacks on the exchange rate. Neither the maintaining of the currency board arrangement nor an ‘emergency access’ to the Euro zone would help. The other non-Euro members of the Union still aim to adopt the Euro in the next future and, thus, are reluctant to give up the Maastricht criteria. The Euro countries Slovakia and Slovenia might face a major deterioration of their credit rating if governments would attempt to increase fiscal deficits. All in all, two problems are to be solved: first, the external provision of liquidity to their economies and, second, an approach that <b>anchors</b> <b>policies</b> in the countries against economic nationalism, which is a beggar-thy-neighbor policy. We propose a combination of a reformed exchange rate mechanism with a stability and solidarity fund for all countries. The former would help to avoid too strong depreciations and the latter would provide liquidity to stabilize the exchange rate and the entire economy. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} aiming at classifying a region into different areas {{in order to}} better modelling rural development policies and to highlight the specific multifunctional roles played by agriculture in areas characterized by different levels of rurality. In particular, by examining a case study, the paper highlights the need to adapt international methodologies to the specific socio-economic structure of a region, {{in order to better}} targeting policy actions. The case study is referred to Veneto, an Italian region well known for its diffused-industrialization model based on SMEs. A OECD-modified area classification is proposed and statistically and GIS-comparatively tested. The suggested area classification of Veneto should include: a) the rural area where agriculture plays a limited role in producing market goods but a relevant one in supplying environmental and recreational services and internalizing into the market some of them; b) the rural-urban area where market-oriented agriculture is relevant and it answers to important social needs such us low housing social cost, environmental friendly practices, high quality products supply and a balanced link between agriculture and low-medium scale manufacturing sector; c) the urban area where agriculture is marginal in food supply but it can play a relevant role in providing environmental, recreational and social services to its residents.

40|$|In the {{two years}} since we last convened in this majestic setting to discuss {{monetary}} policy, real output has expanded rapidly and inflation has slowed significantly. However reluctant policymakers are to take credit for the economy's exceptional performance and pat themselves on the back in public, the critique presented by Bob Hall must come close to provoking a response. Serving as a force for moderation and so as not to foster the wide-spread notion that economists rarely agree on anything, especially policy issues, my plan is to focus on the core of Bob's paper, around which I be-lieve most economists and policymakers may be able to rally. Moreover, leaving most of the technical nitpicks to Stigler's conference handbook should help engender a constructive dialogue more in concert with the intoxicating beauty and dignity of our surroundings. The economy's evolution {{over the past two years}} has proceeded within a policy strategy often characterized as "pragmatic, eclectic, and flexible. " However well such a strategy appears to have worked, many, including the farsighted prime movers behind this conference-Roger Guffey and Thomas E. Davis-have become increasingly concerned about the ab-sence of a reliable, strong, well-understood <b>anchor</b> for <b>policy.</b> Skilled sailors know that reliable anchoring entails good holding ground, proper equip-ment, and informed technique. Designed to absorb the shocks of winds and currents as they change direction and velocity, an essential ingredient of successful anchoring is adequate "scopen-the ratio of anchor line to the depth of the water. The lower'the ratio (i. e., the less scope), the tighter is the tether linking the boat and the anchor. Although quite serviceable in calm waters, such a configuration is not very tolerant of shocks. As a result, the anchor can easily slip or break loose, becoming dysfunctional. In contrast, adequate scope builds in sufficient flexibility to absorb shocks. At the other extreme, a huge ratio (i. e. very large scope) comes to 162 Raymond E. Lombm approximate a vessel drifting aimlessly.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Three methodologies to {{estimate}} the natural interest rate, NIR, are imple-mented for the Colombian economy. Two methods are statistical filters and the third involves some economic theory. The first method is based on unobserved components decomposition of the real interest rate and explores the statistical characteristics of the data. The second is a multivariate version of the Hodrick-Prescott filter augmented by an economic relationship, HPMV. The NIR in both cases {{is defined as the}} trend component of the market real interest rate; then, the NIR may be considered as a long-run real interest rate <b>anchor</b> for monetary <b>policy.</b> The third method consists in estimating a semi-structural model for a small open economy. In this case the NIR is defined as the interest rate that does not affect the output dynamics in the short run and assures output and inflation con-vergence to their long run equilibriums. This implies that the NIR is a medium-run <b>anchor</b> for monetary <b>policy.</b> Three features are observed in the dynamics of the NIR estimates for the period 2000 - 2009.
