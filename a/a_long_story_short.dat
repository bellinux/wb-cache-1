He {{grew up in a}} catholic church but has said he didn't have a personal relationship with God until about 2013. In his own words 'To cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> ...we were touring Sri Lanka and myself, AB De Villiers, Faf Du Plessis and David Miller started a little Bible study together in the national team. One of the sessions was called ‘Salvation’ {{and at the end of}} the chapter it asked you the question of whether you are willing to commit yourself to God. On that night all four of us committed our lives to him, this all happened in a marine boat place in Sri Lanka somewhere. Months later I got baptised along with my wife.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Short story: A work of {{at least}} 2,000 words but under 7,500 words. The {{boundary}} between <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> and <b>a</b> novella is vague.|$|R
5000|$|He {{has written}} an {{unpublished}} novel but reduced it to <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> and believes [...] "if you've {{got something to}} say and {{you can say it}} with less, that's the way to go." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Absolutely, old man. You're {{perfectly}} right. Well, to cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> Nelly Bryant told me {{that she}} and Jill were rehearsing with a piece called 'The Rose of America.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be {{that she}} feels a {{delicacy}} in writing to you on such a subject; though I own--. However, to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> if you like, I will write to her myself." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1829, Mérimée {{found a new}} {{literary}} {{genre that}} perfectly suited his talents; the nouvelle or novella, essentially <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> or <b>short</b> novel. Between 1829 and 1834, he wrote thirteen stories, following three basic principles; a brief story told in prose; a spare and economical style of writing, with no unneeded lyricism; and a unity of action, all leading to the ending, which was often abrupt and brutal. In a short period Mérimée wrote two of his most famous novellas, Mateo Falcone, about a tragic vendetta in Corsica, and Tamango, a drama on a slave-trading ship, which {{were published in the}} Revue de Paris, and had considerable success.|$|R
5000|$|The {{approximate}} page-count of {{each story}} places their literary format somewhere between <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> and <b>a</b> <b>short</b> novella, {{with the exception}} of the [...] "Foreworld SideQuest Comics" [...] which are in comics format. All were initially published in e-book and/or audio formats only.|$|R
5000|$|In Spectator, Greene {{singled out}} the opening passages: [...] "Come {{in at the}} Door is a novel of {{exceptional}} interest; the first hundred pages, had they been published separately as <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story,</b> could have ranked with the best stories of childhood in English." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Fulkerson laughed. [...] "We've got {{round to}} Dryfoos again. I thought I could cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> but I {{seem to be}} cutting a short story long. If you're not in a hurry, though--" ...|$|E
60|$|To make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> {{the boat}} was nearly filled with cod before the sun set, and that night was spent in general rejoicing and feasting on fish--with a second course of pork and pancakes {{for those who were}} insatiable.|$|E
60|$|Well, to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> {{we found}} the island and the treasure--a great iron-bound oak chest, wrapped in many layers of oiled sailcloth, and as strong and firm as when it had been buried nearly two hundred years ago.|$|E
5000|$|To make <b>an</b> already <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>shorter,</b> we {{have decided}} to play {{together}} again, not as the resurrected corpse of a one-off reunion show, but {{as a group of}} guys who love making music together. We will remain committed to our families and our other musical endeavors, so we’re unsure of how often you’ll hear from us, but you can expect more shows and more music in the coming year. We will be playing some shows in California at the end of January, 2006, in L.A. and San Francisco. Thanks for your support." ...|$|R

50|$|To cut <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> Hania's mom {{was never}} in favor of Hamza {{becoming}} her son in law so she goes to every extent to ruin Hania's happiness. Hania also starts doubting Hamza's cousin Aaliya as she finds out {{that she used to}} like him <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time ago yet she had no intentions of creating problems for the two. Hania's mom however fills her brain with so many false accusations about Hamza and Aaliya that she eventually starts hating them. Her mom becomes so successful in her plan that she causes the two to get divorced.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She must. Oh, {{that girl}} had a nerve, I can tell ye! Well, to cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> that's {{how she got}} back the house and field that were, {{strictly}} speaking, gone from her; and by getting them, got her a husband.|$|E
60|$|However, to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> we {{remained}} hove to until day dawned, {{and then}} we were within a cable's length of a large ship, while a mile or more further up the bay was the vessel that had first hailed.|$|E
60|$|Man after man capped this brave speech; the minority, who, if {{they liked}} little to go, liked still less {{to be left}} behind, gave in their consent perforce; and, to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> Amyas conquered, and the plan was accepted.|$|E
5000|$|His {{development}} and {{mastery of the}} nouvelle, <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> or <b>short</b> novel, was another notable contribution to French literature. When he began his writing career in the 1830s, the most prominent genres were the drama (Victor Hugo and Musset; poetry (Hugo, Lamartine and Vigny)), and the autobiography (Chateaubriand). Mérimée perfected the <b>short</b> <b>story,</b> with an economy of words and action. The contemporary literary critic Sainte-Beuve wrote: [...] "...He goes right to the fact, and goes immediately into action.. his story is clear, lean, alert, vivid. In the dialogues of his characters {{there is not a}} useless word, and in his actions he lays out in In this advance exactly how and why it will have to happen." [...] In this genre, he was the contemporary of Edgar Allan Poe and the predecessor of Guy de Maupassant.|$|R
5000|$|Few months later, it was {{reported}} that the song won't make it as one of the soundtracks of that movie, with Sully Erna stating that [...] "It’s <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story,</b> but the <b>short</b> of it is, I lost the movie. Stallone decided to change out the scene that the song was married to. So since the scene went, so did the music. Very sad about that." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Big Mama's Funeral" [...] (Los funerales de la Mamá Grande) is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> by Gabriel García Márquez that satirizes Latin American {{life and}} culture. It {{displays}} the exaggeration associated with magic realism. Most {{of the place}} names mentioned come from Colombia, and [...] "Big Mama" [...] herself is an exaggeration of the 'cacique' (political boss), a familiar figure in Latin American history and tradition.|$|R
6000|$|... "She fleed at him, and, to cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> {{he owned}} to having carried off five sack altogether, upon her {{promising}} not to persecute him. Well, he's turned out neck and crop, {{and my question}} is, who's going to be baily now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Little cared Forsyth for that. He lay almost stunned on his couch, quite {{regardless}} of the storm. To his surprise, however, the toothache did not return. Nay, to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> it never again returned to that tooth {{till the end of}} his days! ...|$|E
60|$|All {{having been}} prepared, our {{engineer}} descended {{with the necessary}} tools, and, to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> riveted a new plate over the old one {{in such a way}} as effectually to close the leak, so that thereafter it gave no further trouble or anxiety.|$|E
50|$|Poil de carotte (Carrot Head) is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> or autobiographical {{novel by}} Jules Renard {{published}} in 1894, which recounts the childhood and {{the trials of}} a redheaded child. It is probably in this miserable childhood story where one should look for the origins of Renard's skepticism and irony, his skill in using litotes, his dense and precise style, and his harsh method of observation. The story unfolds {{in a series of}} short sketches.|$|R
500|$|The Landlady in {{its length}} lies between <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> and <b>a</b> <b>short</b> novel. According to Neuhäuser, the story {{incorporates}} themes found in artistic fairy tales, which, unlike typical folk tales, are {{written by a}} particular person, and not collected from hearsay. According to Professor S. Gibian, The Landlady is a [...] "recreation of folktale diction and imagery" [...] and [...] "its plot {{is based on the}} three folklore motifs, manwoman dominance, the incestuous fatherdaughter relationship, and Volga outlaw tales." ...|$|R
5000|$|The next {{problem was}} finding a drive shaft {{that was long}} enough, {{straight}} enough, and perfectly symmetrical. Off hand you wouldn't think {{this to be a}} problem, but surprisingly enough we again find only one manufacturer in the world that makes such an animal. To make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>a</b> bit <b>shorter,</b> we ran through a similar problem with almost each and every part that goes into the BiroTron. Also you must realize that in many cases we couldn't correct one problem until the preceding one was taken care of...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. And {{the failing}} has, I regret to say, grown on {{him since he}} {{returned}} from the war. My poor sister was extremely worried. In fact, to cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> I induced him to accompany me to America. I am attached to the British Legation in Washington now, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{there was}} her hair up in buckle as if she'd {{never seen a}} clay-cold man at all. However, to cut <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> all I know besides about 'em is that the name upon their luggage is Lady Petherwin, and she's the widow of a city gentleman, who {{was a man of}} valour in the Lord Mayor's Show.' ...|$|E
60|$|I own I was {{confounded by}} an offer, not only so unprepared, but couched in terms so singular. But he {{knew very well}} how to obtain his purposes, for {{he was not only}} {{handsome}} in person, but his very coolness had a charm; and to make <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> <b>short,</b> a fortnight later I became the wife of the Honourable Henry Luxmore.|$|E

50|$|Dufresne's third novel, Deep in the Shade of Paradise (2002) was a Book Sense Top Ten of the Year selection. It {{contains}} {{some of the}} same characters as Louisiana Power and Light, although in an interview with writer Max Ruback which appeared in the Winter 2001 issue of the literary magazine, Turnrow Dufresne has said that he does not consider it to be a sequel. Both of these novels developed from <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> in his first collection, The Way that Water Enters Stone(1991).|$|R
50|$|The {{first part}} was {{published}} posthumously by Secker as <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> {{in the volume}} entitled A Modern Lover which came out in 1934. This fragment was reissued in 1968 in the Phoenix II collection of Lawrence's assorted writings. It {{is set in the}} East Midlands, where the author was born and spent his youth. The second fragment was finally published along with the introductory section in 1984 and describes the experiences of the main character during his elopement to the continent. The novel is often regarded as autobiographical in places.|$|R
