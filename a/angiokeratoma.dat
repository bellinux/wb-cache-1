40|$|<b>Angiokeratomas</b> are benign tumors {{characterized}} by ectasia {{of blood vessels}} in the papillary dermis associated with acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the epidermis. Dermatological examination of <b>angiokeratomas</b> of Fordyce is {{characterized by}} papular keratotic lesions of erythematous-violet color. They are more common in the scrotum, and vulvar involvement is rarely reported. Histopathology is particularly important to distinguish them from other benign and malignant tumors.

40|$|Isolated <b>angiokeratomas</b> {{are common}} benign {{cutaneous}} lesions, generally deemed unworthy of further investigation. In contrast, diffuse <b>angiokeratomas</b> should alert the physician {{to a possible}} diagnosis of Fabry disease, a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by a-galactosidase deficiency. Glycosphingolipids accumulate in cells throughout the body resulting in progressive multi-organ failure. Difficulties are encountered when trying to interpret the significance of <b>angiokeratomas</b> because they may also occur in other lysosomal storage disorders and rarely in an isolated manner in Fabry disease. We present an algorithm for the classification of <b>angiokeratomas</b> which might prove useful for the diagnosis and management of Fabry disease. Assessment of the clinical features and location of the lesions, personal and family history, skin biopsy, dermoscopy and electron microscopy imaging are sequential steps in the diagnostic process. Assessing the deficiency of a-galactosidase enzyme activity is essential to confirm the diagnosis in males, while mutation analysis is always needed in females. Potentially this algorithm can change the current approach to patients when Fabry disease is suspected, thus improving the diagnostic strategy and management of this disorder. It remains to be decided whether {{the use of an}} algorithm might reduce the number of genetic consultations. As evidence has shown the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in halting progression of the disease before the onset of irreversible organ damage, it is advisable to aim at an early diagnosis in order to achieve timely initiation of effective treatment with benefits for patients and appropriate use of medical resources...|$|R
40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked, {{lysosomal}} storage disease {{caused by the}} inherited deficiency of the enzyme &# 945;-galactosidase A. The diagnosis is usually late, with renal, cardiovascular and/or cerebral complications that reduce life expectancy. <b>Angiokeratomas</b> are asymptomatic lesions present as the initial manifestation and usually less appreciated. Their detection is important for early diagnosis and institution of treatment with enzyme replacement therapy, which prevents late complications reducing morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked {{recessive}} glycolipid storage disease. It {{is caused by}} deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme a-galactosidase A and leads to the accumulation of the enzyme substrate, globotriasylceramide (Gb 3) in many tissues including endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, renal epithelial cells, cardiac myocytes and numerous neuronal cells. In this report, we present 20 -year-old male patient with ischemic stroke in pons. The case had previously been misdiagnosed as polimyositis and vasculitis. <b>Angiokeratomas,</b> neuropathic pain and ischemic stroke in young age suggested a Fabry disease. The diagnosis was confirmed biochemically and genetically. All young adults with stroke, especially if they have additional symptoms like <b>angiokeratomas,</b> proteinuria, neuropathic pain in toes and fingers should be tested for Fabry disease...|$|R
40|$|Isolated <b>angiokeratomas</b> (AKs) {{are common}} {{cutaneous}} lesions, generally deemed unworthy of further investigation. In contrast, diffuse AKs should alert the physician {{to a possible}} diagnosis of Fabry disease (FD). <b>Angiokeratomas</b> often do not appear until adolescence or young adulthood. The number of lesions and the extension over the body increase progressively with time, so that generalization and mucosal involvement are frequent. Although rare, FD remains an important diagnosis to consider in patients with AKs, with or without familial history. Dermatologists must have a high index of suspicion, especially when skin features are associated with other earlier symptoms such as acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, or heat intolerance. Once the diagnosis is established, prompt screening of family members should be performed. In all cases, a multidisciplinary team {{is necessary for the}} long-term follow-up and treatment...|$|R
50|$|In some {{instances}} nodular <b>angiokeratomas</b> can produce necrotic tissue and valleys that can harbor fungal, bacterial and viral infections. Infections can include staphylococcus. If the lesion becomes painful, begins draining fluids or pus, or begins to smell, consult a physician. In these instance a doctor may recommend excision and grafting.|$|R

40|$|Fucosidosis {{is a rare}} {{lysosomal}} {{storage disease}} with clinical presentation of developmental retardation, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and <b>angiokeratomas.</b> Here, a 7 -year-old female patient with progressive dystonic movement disorder and loss of acquired motor skills is presented. Coarse facial feature and abnormal globuspallidus signaling in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) led the patient to be investigated in terms of fucosidosis despite absence of hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and <b>angiokeratomas.</b> Markedly decreased enzyme activity of alpha-fucosidosis led to the correct diagnosis. Conclusion: Various neurological findings have recently been reported in fucosidosis. However, neuroimaging findings have not been studied in detail except a few studies. It is critically important to discuss the wide neuroradiological spectrum {{of the disease and}} to highlight fucosidosis in differential diagnosis of bilateral pallidalhypointensity on T 2 -weighted images in brain MRI.
