5|$|Charlie's first notable storyline was {{a lesbian}} {{relationship}} with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children, and Channel Seven was inundated with parental complaints stating that children {{should not be}} exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a great one to portray in terms of acting.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} debut, {{most of the}} {{development}} staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried to patch Bloodlines and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep Troika in business. Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals. That month, Boyarsky confirmed that Troika had not {{been working on a}} patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004. In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's. In a 2006 interview, <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that although Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> he intended to select interviewees {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone {{was among the first to}} confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E

25|$|O'Halloran and Anderson both {{auditioned for}} the role of Dante Hicks (as Anderson's part of Randal Graves from the film had already been filled by future SNL {{performer}} Jim Breuer). After seeing the result, Smith said that it was terrible, and O'Halloran and <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> they were both glad they didn't get the part.|$|E
25|$|During the {{production}} of Thunderbirds the Andersons' marriage began to come under increasing strain, and the company also had a setback when the Thunderbirds Are GO feature film surprisingly flopped. In later interviews, <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that he considered divorce, but this was halted when Sylvia announced that she was pregnant. Their son, Gerry Anderson Jr., was born in July 1967.|$|E

25|$|The Defense Department's only {{official}} {{contact with}} Idema was accepting one prisoner who {{was held for}} a month by the US military but added that officials declined his offer {{to work with the}} government in capturing terror suspects in Afghanistan. In early 2004, Idema was in contact with Heather Anderson, the Pentagon's Acting Director of Security. Anderson was {{under the supervision of the}} chief official responsible for intelligence matters in Donald Rumsfeld's office. Idema told the Afghan court that Anderson commended his work but <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> she later turned down Idema's request to work in Afghanistan for the Pentagon. Idema continued to contact Anderson's office in hopes of establishing a relationship.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, 2008, Move America Forward {{screened}} {{a television}} advertisement on the University of California, Berkeley campus that {{was critical of}} the Berkeley council.

The advertisement will run on Bay Area and Sacramento news programs as well as nationally on Fox News and CNN. In response to the advertisement Council member Max <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that the council will not be bullied or coerced into action.|$|E
500|$|Resident Evil {{films have}} {{received}} consistently bad reviews. Cinefantastique described Guillory's performance as Valentine in [...] (2004), in which Valentine has a supporting role, as the film's only [...] "saving grace". Director Paul W.

500|$|About Johann Urb's casting in Resident Evil: Retribution, the film's {{producer}} and director Paul W. S. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You {{have no idea}} {{how difficult it is to}} find someone with Leon Kennedy's hair [...] has to be manly and has to have these long bangs," [...] adding that [...] "if you put photographs of them side-by-side, it's almost like he was manufactured by Capcom." [...] <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that the decision to include Leon and other game characters in the film was [...] "fan-driven". Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched voice. I feel like he talks how I naturally talk, which is kind of slower." [...] Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: [...] "It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're waiting for it to happen, but it never does. Maybe in the next one, I'm hoping." ...|$|E
500|$|At a coroner's inquest, several {{witnesses}} had {{testified that}} they saw Shay shoot Euell after an argument over a sugar bowl. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> {{that she did not}} see much after the initial verbal exchange because she fled the dining area as soon as the argument escalated. At trial, <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that Shay had two drinks at the cafe. She said that Euell had been staring at her, was rude to them and lunged toward Shay before the shooting. The cafe's manager said that Euell had not been rude to Shay. Two waiters denied that Euell had lunged at Shay. A cashier testified that when Shay asked for sugar, Euell pointed out that there was already some on his table, but he brought two more bowls. She said that Shay called Euell [...] "smarty" [...] and confronted Euell with the gun while the waiter was walking away. Shay denied being drunk and said that Euell hit him and threatened to kill him before the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Koolen {{described}} the music as having [...] "absolutely no connection or Dream Theater influences whatsoever... Kevin Moore mixes dark ambient, post-rock and psychedelic music to create Chroma Key’s music." [...] He compared the album's sound {{to that of}} Tortoise, Millenia Nova, Sigur Rós and early Pink Floyd. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that the album [...] "sounds more like a twisted collaboration between Gábor Csupó and Muslimgauze than anything else you're likely to hear on the InsideOut label." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Anderson</b> is <b>said</b> to have {{received}} the French Légion d'honneur medal in the park at Cambrai in 1916. However, the Musée de la Légion d'honneur says that Augustin Thomas Anderson, a colonel in the British Army, received the medal on 12 December 1918.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anderson</b> was <b>said</b> to be indefatigable in his {{aim to make}} Aberdeen University library {{the best}} in the country. He was one of the founders, and the Secretary from the start, of the New Spalding Club which {{published}} scholarly works about the history of Aberdeenshire.|$|R

500|$|Anderson {{explained}} to the Los Angeles Times the confusing, forbidden nature of the word [...] "fuck" [...] {{in the face of}} the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it. He commented on its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|Delta Air Lines, which owned Northwest {{until all}} {{operations}} were merged into Delta on January 31, 2010, said its Detroit {{group did not}} handle security for the flight.

50|$|The novel {{introduces}} FIDO (Foreign Intruder Defense Organism), a semi-organic droid defensive system set up {{to defend}} the Solo children.

500|$|After their {{break up}} Charlie gets drunk {{and goes into}} work as normal the next day. While on duty Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) becomes stuck down a storm drain. Charlie {{attempts}} to save her but a storm forces the water levels to rise. As Charlie is hungover, Anderson told Inside Soap that [...] "Charlie's a bit dazed and confused when all this happens". However, she is a [...] "professional and goes straight into work mode". When Charlie frees Annie, a wave of water floods the drain and Charlie is swept away. Roman then arrives {{on the scene and}} fights to save Charlie. Anderson explained that it is up to Roman to save Charlie's life and said [...] "of all people it has to be the guy who's just broken her heart". Off-screen the scenes in the storm drain posed a series of logistical challenges for the production team. The series had a specially built set for the scenes and they placed jets under the water to create rough waves. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that she could swim and was not afraid to film in the water. The only problem was the temperature of the water. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "It was absolutely freezing. Filming was tough work, but I think the finished result is worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Santa Barbara Independent, <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students. The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class. <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> it was not {{the use of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a Fuck for Forest concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy. The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at William Penn High School without previewing it or sending permission slips home to parents. He told the Philadelphia Daily News that before showing the documentary, he was unaware that it contained the clip showing sexual intercourse. He was dismissed from his position by the school principal, and his termination was upheld by the regional superintendent. The teacher did not appeal the decision, instead retiring. An analysis of the incident by the Philadelphia Daily News concluded that the school district's decision to fire the teacher was appropriate, but also agreed with the teacher's position that showing a 90-minute DVD should not have obliterated his 19 years as an educator.|$|E
500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{was highly}} praised by Carter, saying that [...] "I think that Redux II {{is one of}} the best episodes we've ever done". Frank Spotnitz said [...] "Redux II is one of my {{favorite}} episodes. I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, and it just comes to a perfect point for me". <b>Anderson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I thought it was a terrific episode, especially the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E
