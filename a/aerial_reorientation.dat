40|$|The {{remarkable}} aerial agility of long-tailed lizards [1] {{has sparked}} significant interest in Inertial Reorientation (IR) – the induced rotation of a ‘body ’ by inertial forces arising from opposed internal motion of an appendage – {{resulting in a}} proliferation of robots with varying capability and morphology. Likewise, IR capability has been identified in animals as diverse as moths and prosimians, and hypothesized in cheetahs and other large vertebrates. Motivated by a need for principled design tools, we developed a framework for designing an optimal inertial appendage – that is, the morphology which allows a robot to complete a particular <b>aerial</b> <b>reorientation</b> task while minimizing its cost with respect to other capabilities. We defined the Inertial Reorientation template [2], the simplest model of an IR maneuver, and leveraged its linear dynamics to develop two constraints on body morphology which ensure completion of the task (here, a planar, aerial rotation in finite time). Practicable IR morphology (tails, reaction wheels, and flailing limbs) can be ‘anchored ’ to the template constraints through a family of mappings from their respective parameter space {{to that of the}} template so as to permit all design to take place in the simpler model’s reduced parameter space. Our template-anchor relations revealed advantages to each type of morphology, with the bio-inspired (tail) morphology prevailing in cases where large, rapid reorientations are desired. In turn, our robot-centric design approach produced powerful tools for the comparative biomechanics of IR in animals, enabling evaluation of performance across the diversity of natural systems, and testing long-open questions on the scaling of the mechanism to large, extinct animals like therapod dinosaurs. The specific power to reorient in one body length of vertical fall scales as M 1 / 6, suggesting broad utility of IR across scales, from 3 gram geckos to 30 kilogram theropod dinosaurs and beyond...|$|E
40|$|How {{can we make}} a robot {{that can}} go {{anywhere}} on its own? This thesis presents several new behaviors on the RHex robot that greatly increase the variety of obstacles that it can overcome, including vertical jumps, flips, leaps onto and across ledges, <b>aerial</b> <b>reorientations,</b> and proprioceptively-aware behaviors. These behaviors inspire new tools to model and understand their transitional nature, wherein {{it is no longer}} useful to think of each step as being an equal part of a steady state gait. Legged robots will necessarily experience a variety of changing contact conditions as they locomote in complex environments epitomized by the rocky, sandy desert. Drawing on the much more mature literature of robot manipulation, this thesis presents the new modeling paradigm of 2 ̆ 2 self-manipulation 2 ̆ 2 that formally generates analytical equations of motion across all contact states. The framework is amenable to many ubiquitous simplifying assumptions (such as rigid bodies, plastic impact, persistent contact, Coulomb friction, and massless limbs) to reduce the complexity of these models despite the obvious physical inaccuracies that each incurs. Nevertheless the models capture enough of the physical world to represent the challenges confronting interesting behaviors in a qualitatively correct manor, including the effects of impulsive transitions between the various contact modes. More than numerical simulation, our goal is the distillation of these physically parametrized models into formal design insights (platform design, behavior design, and controller design), utilizing a variety of analytical and numerical methods. These behaviors are only possible with a robot designed to be both robust and powerful, and they make use of the unique capability of legged machines to interact with the environment in varied and, possibly, unpredictable ways. Careful actuator modeling is needed to achieve such acrobatic results, and so this thesis presents a spectrum of motor sizing tasks to ensure that the platform is up to the task. These tools are used to gain insight into various dynamic transitions for RHex, and we conjecture that their generalization will be of importance for a broad class of legged robots operating in remote and unstructured terrain. ...|$|R
