5|$|On Enterprise, <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{gathered}} in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E

5|$|The Venusian {{atmosphere}} {{has been}} found to be sufficiently out of equilibrium as to require further investigation. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from the Venera, Pioneer, and Magellan missions has found the chemicals hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) together in the upper atmosphere, as well as carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The first two gases react with each other, implying that something must produce them. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it is present in the Venusian atmosphere. However, the planet's volcanism could explain the presence of carbonyl sulfide. In addition, one of the early Venera probes detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud deck.|$|E

5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} the present thesis is the cluster <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> structured <b>data,</b> in particular with spatial and temporal coupling structure, and with ordinal structure of individual observations.

Applications include segmentation of image and remote sensing data, video sequences, and cluster <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> rank <b>data.</b> For the cluster <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> ordinal <b>data,</b> we introduce a mixture model suitable for the simultaneous representation of partial rankings of different lengths.

40|$|Abstract Recently, gene set {{analysis}} (GSA) {{has been}} extended from use on gene expression data to use on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in genome-wide association studies. When GSA has been demonstrated on SNP data, two popular statistics from gene expression data analysis (gene set enrichment analysis [GSEA] and Fisher's exact test [FET]) have been used. However, GSEA and FET have shown a lack of power and robustness in the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> gene expression <b>data.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this work is to investigate whether the same issues are also true for the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> SNP <b>data.</b> Ultimately, we conclude that GSEA and FET are not optimal for the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> SNP <b>data</b> {{when compared with the}} SUMSTAT method. In <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> real SNP <b>data</b> from the Framingham Heart Study, we find that SUMSTAT finds many more gene sets to be significant when compared with other methods. In an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> simulated <b>data,</b> SUMSTAT demonstrates high power and better control of the type I error rate. GSA is a promising approach to the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> SNP <b>data</b> in GWAS and use of the SUMSTAT statistic instead of GSEA or FET may increase power and robustness. </p...|$|R
