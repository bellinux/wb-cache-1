40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for the calculation of the aerodynamic forces acting on a ‘swallow tail’ wing of small aspect ratio. Lift, induced drag, and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> <b>position</b> of simple swallow tail wings (Fig. 1 (b)) are computed as an application. For a given incidence, lift and induced drag are, {{within the limits of}} the theory, proportional to aspect ratio and independent of speed. The chordwise life distribution rises linearly from zero at the apex, drops rapidly in the region of the root chord trailing edge, and then decreases gently to zero...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{low-speed}} tunnel {{tests have}} been made on wing-body combinations vnthout tail plane, to fmd {{the effect of the}} body on and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> <b>position.</b> Model variations included front cm 0 and rear body length, body diameter, depth and nose shape, wing height and angle, wing root fillet and wing aspect ratio. The wing was not swept back. Dlmcnsrons <rere based primarily on those of current civil aircraft. The results shoved that the change in aerodwic centre position, Kn, varies linearly with front body length and m a secondary ad&tional;iay viith rear body length; it is virtually independent of wing angle and height.

40|$|Marc~z, 1947 Su,mmary. [...] From syste~natic three-component {{measurements}} of wing-body combinations with swept wings {{it has been}} found that the movement of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> due to the influence of the body is greater for a swept forward than for a straight wing and less for a sweptback wing. The forward shift of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> due to the body for normal wing body combinations is about 0. 06 c for a straight wing, about 0. 12 c for a 30 degrees swept forward, but about zero for a 45 degrees sweptback wing. A simple theoretical method is given for calculating this movement of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> due to the influence of the body, and it is shown that the agreement with experimental results is quite good. 1. Dctroduction. [...] For combinations of bodies and wings without sweepback (i. e., straight wings) the influence of the body gives a forward movement of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of about 5 to 8 per cent. of the mean chord. This movement of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> can be calculated in a simple manner using Mnlthopp's method. ~ The agreement with experiment is good as is shown by systematic measurements made by E. M 611 er and H. Trienes. 12 For wing-body combinations with sweptback wings this movement of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> depends very much on the angle of sweepback.

50|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{static stability}} of an aircraft is significantly {{influenced by the}} distance (moment arm or lever arm) between the centre of gravity (c.g.) and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of the airplane. The c.g. is established by {{the design of the}} airplane and influenced by its loading, as by payload, passengers, etc. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> (a.c.) of the airplane can be located approximately by taking the algebraic sum of the plan-view areas fore and aft of the c.g. multiplied by their blended moment arms and divided by their areas, in a manner analogous to the method of locating the c.g. itself. In conventional aircraft, this point is aft of, but close to, the one-quarter-chord point of the wing. In unconventional aircraft, e.g. the Quickie, it is between the two wings because the aft wing is so large. The pitching moment at the a.c. is typically negative and constant.|$|R
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} {{twisting force}} is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards coarse pitch and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.|$|R
50|$|However, so we don't get {{centre of}} gravity or <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> {{movements}} aft of the blade elastic axis (which can introduce undesirable aerodynamic and inertial couplings), then the tip must be configured with an area shift forward. This can be {{kept to a minimum}} by recognizing that the Mach number is varying along the blade so {{we do not have to}} use a constant sweep angle, thereby minimizing the amount of forward area shift.|$|R

50|$|An entry vehicle's {{pitching}} moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas effects. Both the Apollo-CM and the Space Shuttle were designed using incorrect {{pitching moment}}s determined through inaccurate real-gas modelling.

The actual <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of the Columbia was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas effects. On Columbia’s maiden flight (STS-1), astronauts John W.

40|$|Summary. The report {{describes}} a theoretical investigation {{in support of}} measurements being made on an oscillating half-wing model of the plan-form shown in Fig. 1 in the National Physical Laboratory 25 in. by 20 in. Wind Tunnel fitted with slotted liners. Little {{is known about the}} steady or unsteady characteristics of M-wings. Results are obtained by low-frequency theory at Mach numbers 0 and 0. 8 and by general theory for frequency parameters 0. 3 and 0. 6 (based on mean chord) at the Mach number 0 - 8. The calculations cater for rigid pitching about an arbitrary axis and rigid bending about the wing root, the latter mode being used experimentally to estimate forces on a complete rolling M-wing. The sharp kinks located at the root and mid-semi-span of the leading and trailing edges subject the theories to a severe test. The calculated steady characteristics reveal a very slow rearward trend in <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> as Math number increases and large discrepancies in the local <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> over the outer panel of the M-wing. The oscillatory characteristics are summarized in tables of the calculated pitching and bending derivatives, the former being given numerically for the three pitching axes for which provision. is made in the experiments.
