500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{supposed}} that Ballard's {{exposure to the}} atrocities of war at an impressionable age explains the apocalyptic and violent nature of much of his fiction. Martin Amis wrote that Empire of the Sun [...] "gives shape to what shaped him." [...] However, Ballard's own account of the experience was more nuanced: [...] "I don't think you can go through the experience of war without one's perceptions of the world being forever changed. The reassuring stage set that everyday reality in the suburban west presents to us is torn down; you see the ragged scaffolding, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the truth beyond that, {{and it can be}} a frightening experience." [...] But also: [...] "I have—I won't say happy—not unpleasant memories of the camp. [...] I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on—but {{at the same time we}} children were playing a hundred and one games all the time!" [...] Ballard later became an atheist.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will make}} a charm that will bring him to you, were all the icebergs of Quenland between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> him: <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know, in a way, and yet I did. There was {{somebody}} about who {{made me think}} of England, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> I heard you sing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I {{wanted to}} {{surprise}} you, father. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> I {{thought it would}} be wiser to find out first how well I was likely to do at the examinations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} can, Peter; at any rate, {{it is certain}} she can't find us, {{it would take a}} long time to bring her round, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> she could not sail {{straight}} back against the wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] cried Bonnet, [...] "that shall I do, {{for there}} is naught else I can do. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see,</b> <b>you</b> doubting Greenway, whether I am a pirate or no." ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> whether Pegasus has not wings, and can {{use them}} too!" [...] And he stopped suddenly, choking with emotion, his nostril and chest dilating, his foot {{stamping}} impatiently on the ground.|$|R
60|$|Ah, thereby hangs {{a strange}} tale. We will {{go and look}} at it after breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> with your own eyes one of the wonders which I have been telling you of.|$|R
60|$|VARINKA. Have you no shame? You {{refuse to}} see the most exalted persons. You kick princes and generals downstairs. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> an English captain merely because he has given a rouble to that common soldier. It is scandalous.|$|E
6000|$|ALICE. 'The sheer fun of it, Robert, {{went to my}} head, I suppose. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> {{the more}} Amy felt herself to be my protectress the more she seemed to love me. I am afraid I have a {{weakness}} for the short cuts to being loved.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never do have {{a grudge}} against our patients," [...] said Mr. Kimble, [...] "except when they leave us: <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> we haven't the chance of {{prescribing}} for 'em. Ha, Miss Nancy," [...] he continued, suddenly skipping to Nancy's side, [...] "you won't forget your promise? You're to save a dance for me, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Baas," [...] he said, {{gripping}} {{the edges of}} the stone with his large hands, [...] "when I give the word do <b>you</b> push gently, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see</b> how a black bird can fly. Put your head lower, Baas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{inside that}} rock, which reaches {{up into the}} clouds, is an archway {{very much like the}} one we entered when we climbed the spiral {{stairway}} from the Valley of Voe. I'll get my spy-glass, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> it more plainly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's such a game," [...] said he. [...] "Never mind; let's have dinner, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> it." [...] The reader, however, may {{be quite}} sure that Mrs. Fenwick did not wait till dinner was served before she knew {{the nature of the}} game.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! it {{was rather}} dreary to see one thing going after another. But somehow, after I lost my own black mare, poor Minnehaha, I never cared so much {{for any of the}} other things. Once for all, I got ashamed of my own childish selfishness. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> the worse things were, the {{stronger}} the call for exertion. That was the great help.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{comfortable}} feeling {{to know that}} you stand on your own ground. Land is about the only thing that can't fly away. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> land gives so much more than the rent. It gives position and influence and political power, to say nothing about the game. We'll go back now. I daresay your mother will be at home by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} as {{a witness to the}} assault Busby made on me; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> you're all housebreakers"--he waved his hand toward the front window, from which the screen had been torn and the glass broken--"and {{housebreaking}} is pretty serious business even in this country. Furthermore, you were all concerned in that raid, and I'm going to see that you all feel the full weight of the law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop, stop, Clara!" [...] exclaimed Marian, {{and now she}} did blush, [...] "will you be {{satisfied}} if I {{tell you that it}} is not what you suppose? You shall hear what it is to-morrow, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see</b> what nonsense <b>you</b> have been talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be in a {{hurry to}} thank your saints!" [...] shouted Ivo to his victims. [...] "I shall be back this day three months; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> a row of gibbets all the way from here to Deeping, and an Englishman hanging on every one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, we {{have just}} got one ready!' said the Witch. 'Here is a barley-corn for you, but it's not the kind the farmer sows in his field, or feeds the cocks and hens with, I can tell you. Put it in a flower-pot, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see</b> {{something}} happen.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But now {{you need}} not earn a living any more. What do you propose to do? Live in town? I can set you going {{in a very good}} lot. You will be quite a lion with that hole in your cheek--by the way, you must tell me the story. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> if {{anything}} happens to me you stand in for the title and estates. That will be quite enough to float you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. I've a few friends, {{but that}} comes of being here so long. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> I ain't {{particular}} as you are. I always see {{that when a}} lady goes in to be evangelical, she soon finds a husband {{to take care of}} her; that is, if she has got any money. It all goes on very well, and I've no doubt they're right. There's my friend Mary Baker, she's single still; but then she began very late in life. Now about Mr Maguire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate Mr. Fothergill, if that'll do any good," [...] {{said the}} Duchess; [...] "and {{we wish we}} could {{get rid of him}} altogether. But that, you know, is impossible. When one has an old man on one's {{shoulders}} one never can get rid of him. He is my incubus; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Trumpeton Wood is such a long way from us at Matching that I can't say I want the shooting for myself. And I never go to Gatherum if I can help it. Suppose we made out that the Duke wanted to let the shooting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He gave it up. “Well, I must be off. The express for Nice passes at four o’clock. I will be away {{about three}} weeks <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> me again. Unless I strike a run of bad luck and get cleaned out, in which case <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> me before then.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] I continued, [...] "it's {{scarcely}} fair. The {{other boys}} are helped by their people, who telegraph {{and give them}} pointers. There's Jim Costello, who never budges without a word from his father in New York. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> if anybody is to win, somebody must lose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{undertake}} to say that, Mr. Dockwrath. I {{think it}} will perhaps be better that I should mention it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{black is}} right!" [...] exclaimed the youth, who, it would seem, had overheard the dispute, while he {{appeared}} otherwise engaged; [...] "the slaver has left his vessel {{in the outer}} harbour, knowing that the wind holds {{so much to the}} westward at this season of the year; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> he keeps his light spars aloft, although it is plain enough, by the manner in which his sails are furled, that he is strong-handed Can you make out, boys, whether he has an anchor under foot, or is he merely riding by a single cable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{do you say}} to our {{leaving this}} {{bulkhead}} up as it is, miss, and making a door through it, and putting a small skylight, say three feet square, over the new part? You see, it will be fifteen feet wide by six feet, so that it will make a tidy little place. It would not cost more than the other way, not so much perhaps; for {{it would be a lot}} of trouble to get this bulkhead down, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> the second hand could have his bunk in here, on the lockers, and be quite separate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Aggie, things don't {{always go}} {{just as they}} ought to do; and you see, when people are poor, and men can't earn enough wages, then their wives and daughters have to help; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> they get rough, more like men, {{because they are not}} doing their proper work. But I want you to grow up soft and gentle, and so, for a time, I want you to live with that lady with the nice boy who pulled you out of the water, and they will make you very happy, and I shall come and see you sometime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lord save us!' exclaimed the old lady, starting; 'don't talk in that way, child. You're {{weak and}} nervous after your illness. Let me wheel your chair round {{to the other}} side; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>see</b> it. There!' said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; 'you don't see it now, at all events.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Governor's {{walks up}} Lee Avenue, the {{principal}} street, developed in their course {{into a sort}} of memorial, triumphant procession. Everyone he met saluted him with profound respect. Many would remove their hats. Those who were honoured with his personal friendship would pause to shake hands, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> would <b>see</b> exemplified the genuine beau ideal Southern courtesy.|$|R
60|$|Then fancy to {{yourself}} a bush like that hawthorn bush, with numberless blossoms, and every blossom on that bush a separate living thing, {{with its own}} mouth, and arms, and stomach, budding and growing fresh live branches and fresh live flowers, {{as fast as the}} old ones die: <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see</b> better what I mean.|$|R
