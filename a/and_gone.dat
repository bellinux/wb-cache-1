Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.|$|E

5|$|Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were {{historical}} characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, {{are based}} on an actual incident {{that took place in}} 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who have died <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.|$|E

Titled , the game was released for the Famicom in 1990. Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei was the first game in the Megami Tensei series, with Atlus eventually buying the rights to the franchise and turning the series into their most famous intellectual property.

5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain <b>and</b> <b>Gone</b> Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines had come <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E

Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> {{to study at}} the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E

Captain Eddie Youds, who overcame a knee problem to return to the side in defence in place of David Brightwell, was the only player not to have played in the second leg against Blackpool. Notts County's side featured only two of the players that had been relegated the previous season – Tony Agana and Shaun Murphy. Their side also contained Darren Ward, who was selected for the Second Division PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) representative side, and Steve Finnan, on loan from First Division Birmingham City.|$|E
