5|$|In {{spite of}} {{retiring}} from the military, Matsui hoped to get <b>another</b> <b>job</b> in China working with the Japanese-sponsored government there. Ultimately, he instead accepted the position of Cabinet Councillor, an advisory post, in June 1938. He continued to serve in this capacity until January 1940 when he resigned to protest Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai's opposition to an alliance with Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Whitehead {{resigned}} {{his senior}} lectureship in mathematics at Trinity {{and moved to}} London without first lining up <b>another</b> <b>job.</b> After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position {{for which he had}} hoped to be seriously considered.|$|E
2500|$|Part of what Rhoads wrote, in {{a letter}} to his friend which began by {{complaining}} about <b>another's</b> <b>job</b> appointment, included the following: ...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{established}} practice that [...] "bumping" [...] may be fair. This means making one employee redundant to save <b>another's</b> <b>job,</b> typically on a last-in-first-out ("LIFO") basis. But the employer has no duty {{to do so}} and the bumped employee may succeed in a claim for unfair dismissal.|$|R
5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim {{was working}} at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for <b>another</b> <b>job,</b> Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla <b>another</b> <b>job</b> in Paris {{with the}} Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of the Senate is light and most members hold <b>another</b> <b>job</b> during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E

5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to <b>another</b> <b>job</b> with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|With Hickton {{coming to}} the end of his career Charlton tried to sign David Cross as a {{replacement}} but refused to go above £80,000 and Cross instead went to West Ham United for £120,000. Middlesbrough finished the 1976–77 campaign in 12th place and Charlton left the club at the end of the season on the belief that four years was an optimum time with one group of players and that he had reached his peak with them – he later regretted his decision and stated that he could have led the club to a league title if he had stayed and signed two more top quality players. He applied for the job of England manager after Don Revie quit the role and after Brian Clough was ruled out by the Football Association but did not receive a reply to his application, and he vowed never to apply for <b>another</b> <b>job</b> again and instead wait until he was approached.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have <b>another</b> <b>job,</b> at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
50|$|During {{the two-week}} taping of each show, the women not only take on one <b>another's</b> <b>jobs,</b> but also inhabit each other's homes {{and cut off}} all contact with their own friends and family.

5|$|Failing to find <b>another</b> <b>job</b> {{at a news}} agency, he met {{producer}} Allan Burns at a party. Burns got him a job on My Mother the Car {{where he}} was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas. Brooks {{then went on to}} write episodes of That Girl, The Andy Griffith Show and My Three Sons before Sheldon Leonard hired him as a story editor on My Friend Tony. In 1969 he created for ABC the series Room 222, which lasted until 1974. Room 222 was the second series in American history to feature a black lead character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by Lloyd Haynes. The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a white student rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with Gene Reynolds who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at Los Angeles High School for Room 222, and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left Room 222 as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show.|$|E
5|$|Moving into management, he {{took charge}} of Irish club Limerick in 1991, leading the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 1991–92. He {{returned}} to England to coach at Preston North End, also serving briefly as caretaker-manager. He took up his first permanent management role in England at Blackpool in July 1994, but was sacked after two years having narrowly failed to achieve promotion. He spent January 1997 to October 1999 in charge at Notts County, taking them to the Third Division title in 1997–98. He then returned to Bolton Wanderers as manager, leading the club to promotion out of the First Division via the play-offs in 2001, {{as well as a}} League Cup final and UEFA Cup qualification. Following a spell at Newcastle United from May 2007 to January 2008, Allardyce managed Blackburn Rovers for a two-year spell from December 2008. He was appointed West Ham United manager in June 2011, leading the club to promotion out of the Championship via the play-offs in 2012, before leaving West Ham in May 2015 after criticism from fans over his playing style. He was appointed Sunderland manager in October 2015 and saved the club from relegation. He was appointed as manager of the English national team for a brief spell in July 2016, before taking charge at Crystal Palace five months later. After avoiding relegation with Crystal Palace in his first season, he announced his resignation on 23 May 2017, saying he did not intend to take <b>another</b> <b>job,</b> later claiming he would accept an international position.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, the Bournville Village Trust {{was set up}} to {{formally}} control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company.
