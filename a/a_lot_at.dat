The British infantry and Home Guard had little {{with which to}} put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E

25|$|In {{autumn of}} 1855, a ship bearing {{refugees}} from an ongoing cholera epidemic in the Far East (authorities disagree {{as to whether}} this was the S.S. Sam or the S.S. Carolina but primary documents indicate that the Caroline {{was involved in the}} epidemic of 1850 and the SS Uncle Sam in the epidemic of 1855) docked in San Francisco. As the city's rapid Gold Rush area population growth had significantly outstripped the development of infrastructure, including sanitation, a serious cholera epidemic quickly broke out. The responsibility for caring for the indigent sick had previously rested on the state, but faced with the San Francisco cholera epidemic, the state legislature devolved this responsibility to the counties, setting the precedent for California's system of county hospitals for the poor still in effect today. The Sisters of Mercy were contracted to run San Francisco's first county hospital, the State Marine and County Hospital, due to their efficiency in handling the cholera epidemic of 1855. By 1857, the order opened St. Mary's Hospital on Stockton Street, the first Catholic hospital west of the Rocky Mountains. In 1905, The Sisters of Mercy purchased <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> Fulton and Stanyan Streets, the current location of St. Mary's Medical Center, the oldest continually operating hospital in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans.

They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E

500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{was seen}} by 18.24million viewers. It earned an 18 rating, which {{represents}} the percentage of television-equipped homes, and a 31 share, which represents percentage of sets in use. This marked the best ratings performance of a preview or premiere following a Super Bowl since The Wonder Years in 1988. It was also the largest viewership of the first season, in large part due to its 10:25p.m. time-slot immediately following the Super Bowl. Nevertheless, NBC considered it a disappointing performance, based {{on the amount of}} advertising and press coverage the episode received. [...] The episode received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did. Levinson later said the Super Bowl crowd might not have been perfectly suited to Homicide: Life on the Street. In particular, regarding the episode's complex story lines and distinctive visual style, he said, [...] "I imagine anyone who has been drinking <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> a Super Bowl party might have trouble following the show." ...|$|E

So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you.

500|$|At age twenty, Del Rey {{signed a}} USD$10,000 {{recording}} contract {{and moved to}} a trailer park in New Jersey. The album that she recorded was later shelved, catalyzing her to pivot her focus. Instead, she began work in community service, and for the next five years, worked at homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation centers. She was quoted in an interview as saying, [...] "The only passionate people I met in New York, were social workers." [...] A few years later, Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records, an independent record label owned by David Kahne. With the label, she released the three-track EP, Kill Kill, in October 2008 and a full-length studio album Lana Del Ray in 2010. After hearing Del Rey's demo, Kahne contacted her; she obliged, knowing his reputation as a producer and his wish to produce music other than pop. Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey: [...] "I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue".|$|E
500|$|Burt is {{the father}} of glee club member Kurt Hummel.

Murphy took the scene verbatim from his own experience of coming out to his father. He called the father-son relationship [...] "One of the stories that we really love on the show", and one that is [...] "very personal" [...] to him, as he wishes his own father had acted more like Burt. During the first season, Kurt has cause to wonder whether his father truly accepts him. Colfer offered the insight that his character is [...] "more concerned with being OK in his dad's eyes than with anyone else", and said that the bond between them would continue to strengthen as the series progressed. From O'Malley's point of view, [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> stake in their relationship and [...] trying to show other people how it can be, in a positive way.
