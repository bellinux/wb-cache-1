To give the illusion of being a desired customer, the company regularly and repeatedly uses the bank to get payment from {{one or more of}} its customers. These payments are always made, as the customers in question are part of the fraud, <b>actively</b> <b>paying</b> any and all bills raised by the bank. After time, after the bank is happy with the company, the company requests that the bank settles its balance with the company before billing the customer. Again, business continues as normal for the fraudulent company, its fraudulent customers, and the unwitting bank. Only when the outstanding balance between the bank and the company is sufficiently large, the company takes the payment from the bank, and the company and its customers disappear, leaving no-one to pay the bills issued by the bank.|$|R

40|$|Equal pay {{legislation}} in Ontario {{has been a}} source of considerable attention, concern, and conflict since the late nineteenth century. A variety of women 2 ̆ 7 s organizations, human rights groups, labour unions, and political parties <b>actively</b> promoted equal <b>pay</b> for equal work legislation. In March 1951, the Ontario provincial government did enact an equal pay law to rectify perceived inequities between male and female workers. Since that initial legislation, numerous individuals and groups have complained that this legislation has done little to narrow the male-female wage differential in Ontario. In this article we argue that, in fact, the Ontario government 2 ̆ 7 s equal pay law of 1951 did serve to reduce the male-female wage gap in a variety of jobs over the past thirty years. This contention is seen as providing a positive context for the equal pay for work of equal value legislation recently enacted by Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s present Liberal government...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} from prior work, that people {{interacting}} as well as attending to a public display attract further people to interact. This behavior is {{commonly referred to as}} the honeypot effect. At the same time, there are often situations where an audience is present in the vicinity of a public display that does not <b>actively</b> engage or <b>pay</b> attention to the display or an approaching user. However, it is largely unknown how such a passive audience impacts on users or people who intend to interact. In this paper, we investigate the influence of a passive audience on the engagement of people with a public display. In more detail, we report on the deployment of a display in a public space. We collected and analyzed video logs to understand how people react to passive audience in the vicinity of public displays. We found an influence on where interacting users position themselves relative to both display and passive audience as well as on their behavior. Our findings are valuable for display providers and space owners who want to maximize the display's benefits...|$|R

The program is delivered on and off campus by a team at the University of Technology Sydney. In addition to building confidence and skill in curriculum areas, the program aims to introduce young high school students to a tertiary environment and motivate them to engage more <b>actively</b> at school. <b>Paying</b> close attention to a classical music encounter and a trip to a museum, we use ethnographic strategies to consider how looking, doing, listening and proximity facilitate feelings of connection and motivation towards learning. We discuss how an educators’ sensitivity to the listening and speaking body, and the learning and caring body can enhance learning design and opportunities for engagement. Greater awareness of embodiment can enable educators to facilitate rich, sensory learning encounters that are empowering and transformative...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim is {{to examine}} whether {{supermarkets}} may be losing the opportunity to increase customer purchase outlays by means of loyalty points, convertible to acquire specialty goods and services provided by “bonus partners”. Design/methodology/approach – Two econometric models were constructed from data collected from 470 supermarket shoppers in one major Australian city, to predict mechanisms for making shoppers aware of loyalty points accrued on their credit card purchases and for inducing them to pay for purchases with specific credit cards linked to loyalty programmes of which they were members. Findings – Shoppers who are aware consider specialty merchandise in exchange for loyalty points {{to be a significant}} reason for joining a loyalty programme. However, when they <b>actively</b> seek to <b>pay</b> with specific credit cards because of loyalty points do not rank the conversion into specialty merchandise as a significant reason for membership. Research limitations/implications – No insight was sought on the relative importance of attitudes and implications of social influences on attitude formation and behavioural intention with respect to the accumulation of loyalty points. Practical implications – Specialist retailing planners can configure product offerings attractive to customers’ lifestyles and broader interests on the basis of shared insights into buying patterns and personal details captured during their enrolment in affiliated loyalty programmes with “bonus partners”. Originality/value – The paper offers an actionable strategy for customer retention and enhancement...|$|R
40|$|Compensating for reduced public funding, Australian and American {{universities}} <b>actively</b> recruit full-fee <b>paying</b> East Asian international students. University staff, {{aware of}} international students having difficulties coping with cultural and emotional issues, often {{encourage them to}} seek university counselling services. However, East Asian international students under-utilise Western universities? counselling services. It {{has been argued that}} the Western concept of counselling reflects Western cultural values, in particular individualism. Thus the reluctance of international students from more collectivistic cultures to seek counselling services may in part be due to a clash of cultural values. Over a decade ago, Draguns hypothesised the existence of a relationship between Hofstede's cultural dimensions of individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity, and their influence on individuals' attitudes towards psychopathology and treatment modalities. The current study sought to offer empirical support for Draguns' hypothesis as it related to individualism and power distance, and to attitudes towards counselling. In place of Hofstede's cultural dimensions, this study used the Triandis cultural concepts of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism. Using the Triandis Individualism Collectivism Scale (ICS) and the Tinsley Expectations about Counseling-Brief Form (EAC-B) questionnaire, the current study explores the relationship between levels of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, and attitudes towards the roles of counsellors, the roles of clients, and the process and goals of counselling. The research is based on data collected from three cultural groups: ethnic Chinese international students attending Australian universities, and Australian and American university students enrolled in their home countries. This study is unusual in cross-cultural research owing to its use of the Rasch extended logistic model of modern item response theory (IRT) as a means of validating the data prior to standard statistical analysis. Whereas classical test theory emphasises the model fitting the data, the Rasch model of IRT requires that the data fit the model to be considered valid. Psychometric analysis of the ICS found its four scales separately fit the Rasch model quite well, as did three modified scales of the EAC-B. The IRT analysis also provided a means of identifying differential item functioning (DIF), that is, items functioning differently (demonstrating bias) among the three cultural groups. Using the EAC-B to collect pre and post-intervention data, the current study assessed the effectiveness of a videotape intervention as a means of changing within and between-group attitudes towards counselling. It was anticipated that ethnic Chinese participants, representing the group with the least familiarity with counselling, would show the greatest change in counselling attitudes {{as a result of the}} intervention. Americans were expected to show the least change, and Australian participants to be in the middle position. Based on the findings, the intervention did not significantly alter the participants' attitudes towards counselling regardless of their cultural background. Overall, the intervention served to strengthen existing attitudes. Lastly as a means of gaining a deeper understanding of the quantitative findings, the study collected qualitative data from the participants and from university counsellors. These findings indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge about university counselling services even among those participants who were familiar with counselling as a concept. Participants, in general, expressed reservations about seeking counselling due to concerns of being seen by friends. This was particularly true for the Chinese. Chinese participants also expressed scepticism towards a non-Chinese counsellor's ability to understand their problems. In reference to Draguns' hypothesis, overall the findings from this study supported his model. The findings indicated that individuals endorsing collectivistic attitudes expressed a strong preference for counsellors who were direct, expert-like, and helped clients seek concrete solutions to their problems. The study also found that an individual's expressions of cultural dimensions, such as vertical collectivism, were better predictors of counsellor preference than an individual's cultural background. These findings have implications for university policy makers who are responsible for ensuring the existence of an infrastructure capable of meeting the needs of the international students they so actively recruit. This would include appropriate funding for an adequate and diverse counselling staff extending itself to the university community. There are also implications for counsellor education programs in recognising the link between cultural variables and client expectations...|$|R
