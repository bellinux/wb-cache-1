50|$|The Kazinag National Park is home {{to about}} 120 species of birds {{including}} the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Impeyan or monal pheasant (Lophophorus impejanus), cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichii), sparrow hawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus</b> melaschistos), snow pigeon (Columba leuconota), cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), Himalayan pied kingfisher (Ceryle lugubris), lesser pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), jackdaw (Corvus monedula), long tailed minivet (Pericrocotus flammeus), sooty flycatcher (Muscicapa infuscata), Kashmir red breasted flycatcher (Ficedula subrubra) and yellow throated martin (Martes flavigula).|$|R
50|$|Other {{specially}} {{protected species}} {{that live in}} the caves are the slowworm (Anguis fragilis), grass snake (Natrix natrix), sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), dormouse (Glis glis), sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> and the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). For several groups of invertebrates that have been studied, among the most interesting are millipedes (Diplopoda), especially species Brachychaeteuma chins and Geoglomeris subterannea who were first discovered in the Czech Republic at this location. Androniscus dentiger woodlouse are found in the cave system.|$|R
50|$|The chalk downland {{provides}} an important habitat for insects. Many butterflies thrive at the reserve including the chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon), brown argus (Aricia agestis) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea). The woodland and scrub within and surrounding the reserve attract many feeding and breeding birds including the nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), {{great spotted woodpecker}} (Dendrocopos major), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), whitethroat (Sylvia communis), garden warbler (Sylvia borin), hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes), sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus)</b> and hobby (Falco subbuteo).|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} {{prevalent}} in most woodland types in its range, {{and also in}} more open country with scattered trees. Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds {{can be seen in}} any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited <b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus,</b> according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the northern goshawk, it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks.|$|R
5000|$|This {{woodland}} {{complex is}} situated {{on a ridge}} of land overlooking West Sedgemoor.

40|$|Discrimination and {{categorization}} of predators belong {{to one of}} the most important cognitive abilities in animal´s lifes. We tried to find how coloration pattern could influence {{categorization of}} a real predator. Experiments focused on the coloration or colour pattern are mainly done with predators and their prey, for example aposematism or novel coloration stimuli. However, only a very few of these experiments are concentrated on situation, how the prey can recognize their natural predators. In our experiment, we tried to test three discrimination theories: feature theory, exemplar theory, prototype theory. In these experiments we used wild Great tit (Parus major) and dummy of Sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus)</b> in different type of colour patter...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of predator categorization {{has not been}} understood well yet. I examined how coloration pattern and predator size influence categorization by a prey under laboratory conditions. I tested the reaction of great tit (Parus major) to the plush dummies of sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> coloured as sparrowhawk, pigeon, robin and great tit. The same color variations {{were made in the}} sizes of a sparrowhawk and great tit. My results indicate that the coloration plays the main role in the recognition. The size is not important in the dummies coloured as the predator and the conspecific but it plays a role in recognition of other tested dummies (coloured as the pigeon and robin) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of predator recognition hasn´t been understood well yet. There {{are two main}} theoretic attitudes to this problem. Feature theory claims that animals use only some key features of the stimuli for categorization. The other opinion is that animals have a general concept how the predator should look like and local features aren't so important. We examined these theories under labor conditions. We tested the reaction of great tit (Parus major) on wooded dummies of the sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> pigeon (Columba livia f. domesticus) and chimeras between them that differed {{in the type of}} head. Our results show, that great tits probably use combination of both approaches to recognize the predator...|$|R
500|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> {{also known}} as the northern sparrowhawk or simply the sparrowhawk, is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. Adult male Eurasian sparrowhawks have bluish grey upperparts and orange-barred underparts; females and juveniles are brown above with brown barring below. The female is up to 25% larger than the male – one of the largest differences between the sexes in any bird species. Though it is a predator which specialises in catching woodland birds, the Eurasian sparrowhawk can be found in any habitat and often hunts garden birds in towns and cities. Males tend to take smaller birds, including tits, finches, and sparrows; females catch primarily thrushes and starlings, but are capable of killing birds weighing [...] or more.|$|R
50|$|The most renowned {{among the}} animal species {{living in the}} park are wolves, that became extinct {{in the area around}} 1850 because of the {{increased}} number of inhabitants of that period. They reappeared around 150 years later coming from the central Apennine {{at the end of the}} 20th century, and are now an habitual presence in the protected area. They mostly prey on roe and fallow deer, which have also reappeared in the park in the last decades. Birds of prey are well represented by Buteo buteo, <b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus,</b> Falco tinnunculus and Pernis apivorus. Quite common is the European green woodpecker and, close to the streams, Alcedo atthis (common kingfisher), while the population of red-legged partridge is shrinking due to the decreasing amount of farmland.|$|R
40|$|The way, how birds {{discriminate}} and categorize their predators exactly, hasn't {{been known}} yet. More theoretic conceptions {{try to explain}} the mechanism of the categorization, {{one of them is}} the feature theory. The theory is based on that object is a compound of neutral and key features. We decided to examine this theory under labor conditions. We tested yellow expressive eyes of a predator, sparrowhawk, as a key stimul for recognition of predator by tits (Parus major). We used wooded dummies of the predator - sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus)</b> and a nonpredator - pigeon (Columba livia f. domesticus) and made chimeras between those two type that differed in eyes. Our results showed, that eyes really could be a key feature and it may works in a combination with other key stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of wildlife to humans {{is known to}} differ with surroundings. In urban environments that provide suitable habitats for breeding birds, animals adapt to humans and their response is accordingly altered. This study examined the nest defense behavior of female Eurasian sparrowhawks (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus)</b> during the breeding season in {{urban and rural areas}} of Prague. The females showed four different types of reaction to humans that approached the nest and differed significantly between the two study areas. Contrary to expectations, urban nesting females were more aggressive than rural conspecifics. The intensity of response increased as the season progressed, and females defended their broods to a much greater degree than their clutches in both urban and rural habitats, suggesting a differential effort as a function of their relative investment in the breeding attempt conforming with the parental investment hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Stomach samples (proventriculus and gizzard) of {{sparrow hawk}} (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> crow (Corvus corone) and sparrow (Passer domesticus) were {{investigated}} in this study.

50|$|Three {{areas of}} Haldon have been {{designated}} as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The largest is Haldon Forest which covers {{most of the}} high woodland north of the A380 road {{as far as the}} Haldon Belvedere. This area is primarily designated because of its bird life. It is a nationally significant habitat for the European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) with about 80 pairs breeding here. In addition six bird of prey species breed here: the nationally rare European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), the nationally scarce goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), the Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), Eurasian sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). In addition, there have been a total of 35 species of butterflies recorded, including the nationally rare high brown fritillary (Fabriciana adippe) and pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne). Many moth and dragonfly species are also present.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{study on}} the {{avifauna}} of the Seonheul Gotjawal region of Jeju-do (Is.), a survey site of long-term ecological study, was conducted between February of 2011 and January of 2012. A total of 54 species and 1, 039 individuals of birds were observed, with 30 species and 164 individuals observed during spring, 31 species and 174 individuals during summer, 30 species and 206 individuals during fall and 28 species and 868 individuals during winter. In terms of dominant species, Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) was the most dominant at 500 individuals (48. 12 %), followed by Rook (Corvus frugilegus) at 250 individuals (24. 06 %), Black-billed Magpie (Pica pica) at 36 individuals (3. 46 %), Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) at 34 individuals (3. 27 %) and Great Tit (Parus major) and Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) at 26 individuals (2. 50 %) each. The overall species diversity was 1. 95, with the value 2. 69 during spring, 2. 87 during summer, 2. 81 during fall and 1. 29 during winter. The species diversity was low during the winter, because Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) and Rook (Corvus frugilegus) were observed at a relative high level {{when compared to other}} species, at 500 individuals and 250 individuals respectively. Government protected species included 8 natural monument species, such as Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata), Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> Northern Goshawk (<b>Accipiter</b> gentilis), Lesser Cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus) and Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha), and 8 endangered species of Japanese Night Heron (Gorsachius goisagi), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus), Crested Honey Buzzard (Pernis ptilorhychus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (<b>Accipiter</b> <b>nisus),</b> Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha) and Black Paraside Flycatcher (Terpsiphone atrocaudata). Since subtropical birds, such as Japanese Night Heron (Gorsachius goisagi), White-bellied Green Pigeon (Treron sieboldii) and Chestnut-winged Cuckoo (Clamator coromandus) were observed during the study, {{there is a need for}} a continuous monitoring of their migratory pattern and breeding...|$|R
