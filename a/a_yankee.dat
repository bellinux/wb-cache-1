5|$|He {{promptly}} {{became the}} Yankees' best pitcher, recording the highest winning percentage in the AL {{in his first}} season as <b>a</b> <b>Yankee.</b> In 1949, joined by Vic Raschi and Eddie Lopat, he was a star of <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> team that won the first of five consecutive league championships, a feat that had never been achieved before. He played many important roles for those teams. In his first six years with the Yankees he averaged over 232 innings, 17.5 wins, and 14 complete games. As a swingman, he averaged 26 games started and 9 games finished per season.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 2014, Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda was {{believed}} to have been using pine tar in a Yankee-Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium. This was never brought to the umpires attention, therefore it was never tested and no actions were taken. On April 23, 2014, at <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> Red Sox game in Fenway Park, John Farrell noticed that Pineda was using pine tar again. Farrell walked to the home plate umpire and got Pineda ejected from the game in the 2nd inning.|$|E

5|$|On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second-inning {{home run}} {{was the only}} hit by the Yankees against Pedro Martínez, who struck out 17 Yankees—the most strikeouts against <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> team ever. Martínez retired the last 22 batters after giving up the home run, {{including}} striking out eight of the final nine batters. The teams finished first and second in their division and both made the playoffs in the same season. This led to the very first post-season meeting in the longtime rivalry.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{lost the}} World Series in , while the Red Sox loss came in 1986. Both times, the teams lost after being up 2–0 in their {{respective}} World Series, and both losses happened in New York (The Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series at Shea Stadium). For the Yankees, the loss in 1981 {{marked the beginning of}} the team's demise and downfall in the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. Yankee left-hander Dave Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a left-hander at Yankee Stadium and the first no-hitter by <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> since 1951.|$|E
5|$|Fatigued {{from the}} stress of chasing 3,000 career hits and wanting to rest his calf, Jeter opted not to attend the 2011 MLB All-Star Game. Jeter and Posada played their 1,660th game {{together}} on July 14, 2011, breaking the previous franchise record of 1,659 by Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri. Jeter played his 2,402nd game with the Yankees on August 29, 2011, breaking Mickey Mantle's record for most games played as <b>a</b> <b>Yankee.</b> He finished the 2011 season with 162 hits, his 16th consecutive season with 150 hits, which tied him with Pete Rose for the second-most consecutive 150-hit seasons, one behind Hank Aaron for the MLB record. Jeter was honored with the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, given in recognition of charitable endeavors.|$|E

5|$|Cliff Lee {{pitched a}} {{complete}} {{game in the}} Phillies' Game1 victory, allowing only one unearned run, while Chase Utley hit two home runs. In Game2, solo home runs by Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui helped the Yankees win by a score of 3–1. After a rain delayed start, Game3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total runs en route to <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> victory. The Yankees won Game4 by scoring the decisive three runs {{in the ninth inning}} after an alert base running play by Johnny Damon. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game5, aided by Utley's second two–home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time designated hitter to win the award; Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position is not used in NL ballparks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career hit, {{a home run}} off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as <b>a</b> <b>Yankee.</b> Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and HBO produced Derek Jeter 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was <b>a</b> <b>Yankee</b> victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E
