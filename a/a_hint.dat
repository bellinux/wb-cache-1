5|$|In {{the months}} before their departure, Wolfgang {{composed}} prolifically, gaining the favour of Archbishop Siegmund Christoph von Schrattenbach, who, as Leopold's employer, had to consent to the journey. Permission to travel, along with a gift of 600florins, was granted in October. Wolfgang was awarded the honorary title of Konzertmeister (court musician), with <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that on his return this post would merit a salary.|$|E
5|$|On Growth and Form {{explained}} in detail why he believed Darwinism {{to be an}} inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form. Instead, he advocated structuralism {{as an alternative to}} natural selection in governing the form of species, with <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that vitalism was the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} with <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and {{takes on a}} dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E

5|$|The female is plumaged {{like the}} male, but is duller {{and has a}} grey head with a {{different}} pattern from the male, though it bears <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of the pale head markings of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.|$|E

5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman without <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains {{about the lack of}} sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 2006 Dave Meltzer {{reported}} that Eaton was hospitalized {{after suffering a}} heart attack. Two days later, after being released from the hospital, Eaton released a statement through the Wrestling Observer website saying {{that he did not}} have a heart attack but was diagnosed with high blood pressure with <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of diabetes. Since then, he has suffered with several health issues, especially cardiac problems which have seen him hospitalized on several occasions. In June 2013, Eaton underwent successful surgery to have a pacemaker inserted.|$|E

5|$|On {{the next}} morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1620 (1564 CE) as per some sources, Rama again {{appeared}} to Tulsidas, {{this time as}} a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came {{and asked for a}} sandalwood Tilaka (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Suspicions soon arose that Bogdan-Pitești {{had become}} a veritable agent of influence. According to Zambaccian, it was Bogdan-Pitești who {{actually}} dropped <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> that his support for Germany was a lucrative employment. Through various notes in scattered diaries, most {{of which have been}} lost, Caragiale reputedly accused Bogdan-Pitești taking Germany's money to promote her interests in Romania, and to assist her foreign propaganda effort. Such assessments, like Caragiale's allegation that Bogdan-Pitești was not knowledgeable in art, reflected conflicts between the two figures, and their overall reliability remains doubtful. It is however possible that Caragiale himself borrowed, and never returned, some 10,000 lei, siphoned out of the German propaganda funds by Bogdan-Pitești.|$|E
5|$|The heads-up display, which simulates {{the inside}} of Samus' helmet, {{features}} a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; one uses thermal imaging, another has x-ray vision, and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Metroid Prime introduces <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game.|$|E

5|$|The sexes {{are similar}} {{although}} the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii {{is smaller than}} the nominate subspecies and {{the white of the}} outer tail feathers has <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly streaked.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of past {{success in}} 1994, all {{was not well}} behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|As {{the case}} of Ælfwald shows, while the written sources for later Northumbria are few and often written down centuries after the events they describe, archaeological {{evidence}} from coinage is independent of the surviving annals. Anglo-Saxon coins usually named the king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named the mint where they were struck—Northumbrian coinage names York as the place of issue—and the moneyer who produced them. Their weight and silver content can be compared with other reigns, providing <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of the prevailing economic conditions, and the style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when the coins are {{compared with those of}} neighbouring kingdoms and with other forms of art. The evidence of Northumbrian coinage is particularly valuable in the ninth century, when contemporary written evidence all but disappears.|$|E
5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
