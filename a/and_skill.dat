50|$|Following Cameron's win, Willetts was {{appointed}} Shadow Secretary of State for Education <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> in Cameron's first Shadow Cabinet in December 2005, the role Cameron had vacated, and later becoming Shadow Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities <b>and</b> <b>Skills.</b> His title became Shadow Minister for Universities <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> since Gordon Brown's merger of the Department for Innovation, Universities <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform into the Department for Business, Innovation <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> in June 2009.|$|R
50|$|FEDA {{was then}} renamed the Learning <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> Development Agency (LSDA) in November 2000 to reflect its {{widening}} remit across the learning <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> sector.

In 2006 LSDA’s policy and strategic work developed into the Quality Improvement Agency for Lifelong Learning (QIA), now known as the Learning <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> Improvement Service (LSIS). LSDA’s work went on to become an independent organisation - the Learning <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> Network.|$|R
5|$|Appointed {{to lead a}} {{division}} in Italy in 1805, Vukassovich was soon sacked for failing to halt a French attack. The year 1809 found him leading {{a division}} in the invasion of Bavaria. He fought capably in several actions near Regensburg in April. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Wagram in July while leading his troops. Among Austrian generals, he demonstrated above-average initiative <b>and</b> <b>skill,</b> particularly in 1796 and 1809. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment.|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows (B) is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{inspired by}} the novel Watership Down. Published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1976, the game centered on intelligent rabbits. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, {{and the first to}} have detailed martial arts <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official GURPS supplement in 1992.|$|E

Further, despite claims that Chauvel alone had {{a clear view of}} the battle, that his coolness <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> were crucial in gaining the victory, his name was omitted from the long list of honours published on New Year's Day 1917. Murray did offer Chauvel a lesser award (a Distinguished Service Order) for Romani which he declined.|$|E

5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E
5|$|During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, {{six weeks}} before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later {{discovered}} that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison and released after three. The Queen's composure <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> in controlling her mount were widely praised.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to battling on foot, mecha specific to a character can be summoned. While each mech has a fixed main pilot, the sub-pilot can be changed, which alters {{the types of}} attacks the mech can perform. After defeating the enemy, the party receives experience points which raise their basic statistics, <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> points which are used to upgrade each character's skill tree, unlocking new skills. New items and accessories can only be gathered either through searching the environment or defeating enemies, as currency and shops are not present.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to meat or fur hunts, {{there are also}} competition hunts to demonstrate the speed <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> of the dog. In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition hunts are the Grand American, Autumn Oaks, and Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books as Where the Red Fern Grows and popularized in stories and songs recorded by Jerry Clower, Jimmy Martin and others. In Alabama, there is a cemetery specifically for the burial of coonhounds.|$|E
5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen {{of the big}} screen. In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E

5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance <b>and</b> <b>skill.</b> One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|May {{was born}} in Washington, D.C. on August 9, 1818, {{the son of a}} doctor in a {{prominent}} Baltimore family. He received a civil education, but applied for a commission directly to President Andrew Jackson, who was impressed by his soldierly appearance, bearing, <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> at horsemanship. In 1836, he entered the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the Second Regiment of Dragoons. During the Second Seminole War, May was responsible for the capture of King Philip (Ee-mat-la), the Seminole nation's principal chieftain. He was promoted from first lieutenant to captain on February 2, 1841.|$|E
5|$|Players earn {{credits for}} {{knocking}} out opponents, scoring points, and impressing {{the crowd with}} violence <b>and</b> <b>skill.</b> The credits can be used towards player enhancements such as black market performance-enhancing drugs. A crowd meter displays audience support, which boosts the player's team abilities when filled. IGN found the game to heavily rely on teamwork. Computer players on teams rated with low teamwork will not take initiative to pursue the disc or to help teammates in need. This attribute can be raised {{over the course of}} a game.

5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> could make them.|$|E
