5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E

25|$|On 18 April 2003 {{as part of}} {{the third}} report into {{collusion}} between Ulster loyalist paramilitaries, RUC, and British Army, Sir John Stevens published an Overview and Recommendations document (Stevens 3). Stevens' intention was to make recommendations which arose from serious shortcomings he had identified in all three Inquiries. In his autobiography, Stevens was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> point out the high regard in which he held many RUC officers, including Detective Superintendent Maurice Neilly, who was killed in the 1994 Chinook air crash.|$|E
25|$|Botanical Dialogues Between Hortensia and her Four Children, Charles, Harriet, Juliette and Henry Designed For the Use in Schools (1797) as {{the name}} {{suggests}} is constructed as conversations between {{her mother and her}} children. It makes reference to Darwin's versified botanical descriptions of The Botanic Garden (1791). It utilises the sexual differences of plants to point out the different social roles that her sons and daughters are destined to fulfil by society on account of their sex, reflections that are often bitter. While outlining the social norms, she is also <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> distance herself from them.|$|E

25|$|In November and December 2008, the Human League got {{together}} with Martin Fry's ABC and Heaven 17 for 'The Steel City Tour' of the UK. This was Philip Oakey's concept of a joint tour of all three bands celebrating the original electronic music of early 1980s Sheffield (the titular Steel City). Much {{was made in the}} UK media of the history between Heaven 17 and the Human League, the original events of 1980 and the fact they were now working together. Both Oakey and Martyn Ware were <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> explain that any acrimony from that period had long since been forgotten.|$|E
25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have been, had he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> point out.|$|E
500|$|Boyle's {{memory was}} indeed excellent. On one {{occasion}} he illustrated both {{the accuracy of}} his memory and the audacity of his character {{at the expense of}} a brother member.

Unluckily, Stanley happened to drop his manuscript in the coffee-room, and walked back into the House unconscious of his loss. Sir Boyle, finding the document, speedily mastered its contents, and, rising at the first opportunity, delivered the speech almost verbatim in the hearing of its dismayed and astonished author. His apology afterward only added insult to injury: ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the work, Russell's {{ambition}} is {{to develop}} a new method of conceiving the social sciences as a whole. For him, all topics in the social sciences are merely examinations of the different forms of power – chiefly the economic, military, cultural, and civil forms (Russell 1938:4). Eventually, he hoped that social science would be robust enough to capture the [...] "laws of social dynamics", which would describe how and when one form of power changes into another. (Russell 1938:4–6) As a secondary goal of the work, Russell is <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> reject single-cause accounts of social power, such as the economic determinism he attributes to Karl Marx. (Russell 1938:4, 95) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Pound and Flint {{fell out}} over their different {{interpretations of the}} history and goals of the group arising from {{an article on the}} history of Imagism written by Flint and published in The Egoist in May 1915. Flint was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets, especially Edward Storer. Pound, who believed that the [...] "Hellenic hardness" [...] that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was likely to be diluted by the [...] "custard" [...] of Storer, was to play no further direct role {{in the history of the}} Imagists. He went on to co-found the Vorticists with his friend, the painter and writer Wyndham Lewis.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E

500|$|After Jinnah died, {{his sister}} Fatima {{asked the court}} to execute Jinnah's will under Shia Islamic law. This {{subsequently}} became the part of the argument in Pakistan about Jinnah's religious affiliation. Vali Nasr says Jinnah [...] "was an Ismaili by birth and a Twelver Shia by confession, though not a religiously observant man." [...] In a 1970 legal challenge, Hussain Ali Ganji Walji claimed Jinnah had converted to Sunni Islam. Witness Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada stated in court that Jinnah converted to Sunni Islam in 1901 when his sisters married Sunnis. In 1970, Liaquat Ali Khan and Fatima Jinnah's joint affidavit that Jinnah was Shia was rejected. But in 1976 the court rejected Walji's claim that Jinnah was Sunni; effectively accepting him as a Shia. In 1984 a high court bench reversed the 1976 verdict and maintained that [...] "the Quaid was definitely not a Shia", which suggested that Jinnah was Sunni. According to the journalist Khaled Ahmed, Jinnah publicly had a non-sectarian stance and [...] "was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> gather the Muslims of India under the banner of a general Muslim faith and not under a divisive sectarian identity." [...] Liaquat H. Merchant, Jinnah's grandnephew, writes that [...] "the Quaid was not a Shia; he was also not a Sunni, he was simply a Muslim". An eminent lawyer who practised in the Bombay High Court until 1940 testified that Jinnah used to pray as an orthodox Sunni. According to Akbar Ahmed, Jinnah became a firm Sunni Muslim {{by the end of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|By 1952, Kenyatta {{was widely}} {{recognised}} {{as a national}} leader, both by his supporters and his opponents. As KAU leader, he was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> oppose all illegal activity, including workers' strikes. He called on his supporters to work hard, and to abandon laziness, theft, and crime. He also insisted that in an independent Kenya, all racial groups would be safeguarded. Kenyatta's gradualist and peaceful approach contrasted {{with the growth of}} the Mau Mau Uprising, as armed guerrilla groups began targeting the white minority and members of the Kikuyu community who did not support them. By 1959, the Mau Mau had killed around 1,880 people. For many young Mau Mau militants, Kenyatta was regarded as a hero. In April 1952, Kenyatta began a speaking tour in which he denounced the Mau Mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means. In August he attended a much publicised mass meeting in Kiambu where—in front of 30,000 people—he said that [...] "Mau Mau has spoiled the country. Let Mau Mau perish for ever. All people should search for Mau Mau and kill it." [...] Despite Kenyatta's vocal opposition to the Mau Mau, KAU had moved towards a position of greater militancy. At its 1951 AGM, more militant African nationalists had taken senior positions and the party officially announced its call for Kenyan independence within three years. In January 1952, KAU members formed a secret Central Committee devoted to direct action, formulated along a cell structure. Whatever Kenyatta's views on these developments, he had little ability to control them.|$|E
500|$|His last book, The Great Galilean, {{has been}} characterised by one biographer as Keable's attempt [...] "to renconcile {{his love of}} Jesus with his failure to believe in him as a God." [...] The book sought to {{distinguish}} the [...] "historical Jesus" [...] of record from the [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] of church worship. The historical Jesus, Keable said, was so poorly known that there survived too little information for a three-line obituary. Instead, the figure that Christians worshipped was a [...] "traditional Jesus", recorded in the Gospels from an oral tradition that was not really biographical. This [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] became a [...] "literary Jesus", the central figure of the four gospels, and it is on this figure – quite distinct from the actual, historical Jesus – that the contemporary church centred. Keable sought to criticise the attitude in the contemporary church toward [...] "traditional Jesus", given {{how much of the}} rest of [...] "traditional" [...] religion Protestantism had discarded. However, Keable was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> stress that the [...] "traditional" [...] Jesus should not be seen as an , or something to be discarded. The ahistoricity of the traditional Jesus, he said, should not be a reason to leave the church. Without this traditional Jesus, he predicted, Western civilisation would fade and fall. He was, then, critical of the specific ways in which the contemporary church construed Jesus, in its attempts to conflate the traditional Jesus with historical Jesus, which Keable considered impossible. He blamed these actions of the church for the declining numbers of worshippers, and accused it of draining Christianity of profundity by relying too heavily on rationalism and rigid structure.|$|E

2500|$|Today, {{the song}} is widely {{considered}} a classic of its era. In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, described the song as [...] "a devastating chronicle of a frayed romance wrapped in the greatest pop hooks and production of its year."
