5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply <b>as</b> <b>Happy</b> Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst {{the mother of}} one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to have been}} inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him <b>as</b> <b>happy</b> as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
5|$|The director, Jon Favreau, reprises {{his role}} <b>as</b> <b>Happy</b> Hogan, Tony Stark's {{bodyguard}} and chauffeur, while Clark Gregg and Leslie Bibb reprise {{their roles as}} S.H.I.E.L.D.

5|$|It was {{initially}} intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor {{condition of the}} roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known <b>as</b> <b>Happy</b> Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|The film is set {{several months}} after the events of Captain America: Civil War, which is eight years after the events of The Avengers. In April 2016, Feige {{confirmed}} that characters from previous MCU films would appear in the film, with Robert Downey Jr. confirmed to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man shortly thereafter. Favreau, Paltrow, and Evans also reprise their roles <b>as</b> <b>Happy</b> Hogan, Pepper Potts, and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively. The clean-up crew Damage Control appear in the film (after previously being referenced in Iron Man and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) ahead of an intended television series about them. Various weaponry and artifacts from previous films are referenced throughout the film that Toomes and his crew repurpose for their weapons. In Parker's high school, one of his classes has a lesson about the Sokovia Accords, and portraits of Bruce Banner, Howard Stark and Abraham Erskine are seen within the school. Thor's belt Megingjörð is also referenced. The character Aaron Davis makes reference to his nephew Miles Morales in the film.|$|E
