Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a military dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|While at Digital, Kotok {{recognized}} the Web's potential, {{and helped to}} found the World Wide Web Consortium. Early in 1994, in Zürich, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee had met with Michael Dertouzos to discuss starting a new organization at MIT. In April 1994, Kotok, Steve Fink, Gail Grant and Brian Reid from Digital traveled to CERN in Geneva to speak with Berners-Lee <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a consortium to create open standards and coordinate Web development.

5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and maritime patrol requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hours}} {{leading up to}} landfall, the TCWC in Brisbane issued 17 cyclone {{warnings}} for coastal areas. According to the BoM, residents received 20 hours of advance warning in which to complete preparations. By late on 23 December, police and ] workers were on alert for the approaching storm. High public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to BoM cyclone awareness initiatives {{in the wake of}} 1970's deadly Cyclone Ada. However, storm victims still criticised the agency and local radio news stations for unclear, untimely, or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion. Significant delays between the issuance of warnings from TCWC Brisbane and local broadcast in the Townsville area raised some question <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a warning centre closer to North Queensland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{one issue}} that Sumner foresaw, but glossed over, was that land in Charlestown was {{purchased}} {{by the federal government}} as the site for a future naval yard. The ships en route from this yard to the ocean would be blocked by the proposed turnpike. Sumner believed this would not stand in his way, since a standing navy was in such disfavor at that point in the nation’s history. However, the War of 1812, which was considered a naval war, changed <b>the</b> public's opinion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> a naval yard. Because the route through East Boston and over the Boston Harbor would block ships route to the future Charlestown Navy Yard the turnpike was planned to go through Chelsea as opposed to Noddle's Island.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges in health care management is balancing resources with fluctuating and uncertain demand. This study examines whether introducing a standardised process for Sales and Operations planning at a large university hospital improved specialty department managers’ knowledge of planning conditions and if so, whether decisions were made based on this knowledge. Using responses from a survey of 30 specialty department managers at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden, the analyses indicate that operational knowledge strengthens insights <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> strategic decisions, and vice versa. Moreover, knowledge is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for making decisions at the department level. An overall planning and decision structure is required and should be implemented first at the hospital level to effectively allocate resources...|$|R
5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going {{to carry out this}} mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> such pure plutonium {{to make a}} feasible bomb. He also {{suspected that}} the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium {{was supposed to be}} surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E

5|$|Combs' uninspiring {{speeches and}} candidness <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> more state revenue cost him the primary election. Chandler, {{who went on}} to reclaim the governorship, had promised that he would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's {{financial}} obligations, but ultimately he did so. This damaged Chandler's credibility and left Combs looking courageous and honest {{in the eyes of the}} electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a tax of one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's highway and state park systems. He also devoted much of the surplus to education.|$|E
5|$|In April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{wrote in}} his journal Young India <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or {{spinning}} wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, {{but it was not}} delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.|$|E
5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine {{is aware of the}} switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E
