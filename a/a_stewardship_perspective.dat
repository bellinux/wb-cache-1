40|$|We {{integrate}} {{governance and}} leadership literature {{to explain the}} effects of leadership behaviour {{on the development of}} dynamic capabilities in alliances. From <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective,</b> it is argued that the choice of governance mechanisms influences the alliance managers ' leadership behaviour. Transformational and servant leadership behaviours are proposed to influence the development of dynamic capabilities, whereas transactional leadership behaviour influences the maintenance of operational capabilities. Hypotheses are derived outlining the theoretical relationships between leadership behaviours and the alliance innovation process...|$|E

We also suggest that the relationship between psychological ownership and entrepreneurial orientation is mediated by knowledge sharing. Finally, we assess the potential moderating roles of heterogenous governance conditions in terms of the generation in control, generational involvement and family involvement in the top management team with regard to the relationship between psychological ownership and knowledge sharing. Research and managerial implications are shared in the concluding section...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} IASB’s {{statement}} to drop stewardship {{as a separate}} objective of financial accounting and the ongoing debate about increasing the disclosure of soft information, we investigate the economic consequences of publicly reported soft information from <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective.</b> In an LEN model we include market price as a performance measure and investigate whether the principal benefits from disclosing additional information. While the principal can only use contractible performance measures in the contract with the agent, capital market participants can only use disclosed information when pricing firm value. We find that the disclosure of information can decrease the principal’s expected net profit. This result follows from either a noisier or a less congruent market price {{as a consequence of}} disclosing additional information. Thus, we present a rationale for partial disclosure in the absence of proprietary costs or the uncertainty of information endowment...|$|E

40|$|Getting more {{specialist}} engineering {{faculty members}} {{involved in the}} practice of high quality engineering education research (EER) has been a recurring concern at conferences and has been addressed in various initiatives over the last decade. We consider the technology stewardship concept proposed by Etienne Wenger et al. to be a fruitful area for engineering educators who have been increasingly faced with decisions relating to IT-based tools arising from a rapid proliferation of IT technology and tools and a growing emphasis on quality assurance in higher education. Choices need to be made in areas of technology selection, design and adaptation and as these decisions require competences from both engineering and pedagogical domains, the engineering instructor {{needs to be able to}} draw upon both these areas of knowledge and in this paper,as part of a pedagogical framework, we set out to illustrate the processes of tool design, adoption and adaptation in the service of teaching and learning from <b>a</b> technology <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{transaction}} cost economics {{theory of the}} family firm, building upon the concepts of family-based asset specificity, bounded rationality, and bounded reliability. We argue that the prosperity and survival of family firms depend on {{the absence of a}} dysfunctional bifurcation bias. The bifurcation bias is an expression of bounded reliability, reflected in the de facto asymmetric treatment of family vs. nonfamily assets (especially human assets). We propose that absence of bifurcation bias is critical to fostering reliability in family business functioning. Our study ends the unproductive divide between the agency and <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspectives</b> of the family firm, which offer conflicting accounts of this firm type's functioning. We show that the predictions of the agency and <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspectives</b> can be usefully reconciled when focusing on how family firms address the bifurcation bias or fail to do so...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecreational users {{appreciate}} the UK marine environment for its cultural ecosystem services (CES) {{and their use}} and non-use values. UK Governments are currently establishing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) informed by ecological data and socio-economic evidence. Evidence on CES values is needed, but only limited data have been available. We present a case study from the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) follow-on phase that elicited divers’ and anglers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for potential MPAs. The case study is an innovative combination of a travel-cost based choice experiment and an attribute-based contingent valuation method. Our study design allowed us to understand the marine users’ preferences from both a user and <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective.</b> Following the UK NEA’s place-based CES framework, we characterised marine CES as environmental spaces that might be protected, with features including the underwater seascape, and iconic and non-iconic species. Our survey highlighted the importance of CES to divers and anglers. A wide variety of marine spaces influenced user-WTP, while stewardship-WTP was most influenced by management restrictions, species protection, and attitudes towards marine conservation. An understanding of key stakeholders’ CES values can inform a more holistic and sustainable approach to marine management, especially for decisions involving trade-offs between marine protection and opportunity costs of the blue economy...|$|E

40|$|From {{the agency}} perspective, {{literature}} studying links between investor protection and governance profiles argues that family is more disposed than other shareholders to divert private benefits {{in countries with}} a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective,</b> the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm. We do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family counterparts. Some evidence is found as regards the entrenchment effect: family CEOs seem to weaken firm performance. Stewardship attitude – not familiness – does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and increase risk-taking...|$|R

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{barriers to}} realizing <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> relation {{instead of a}} classic principal–agent relation between client and vendor through implementation of an innovative procurement and risk management method, the Best Value approach. This approach focuses on calculus-based trust development {{through the use of}} metrics and alignment of goals and risks between client and vendor. Barriers to realizing <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> relation are analysed {{with the use of a}} theoretical framework that incorporates agency theory and stewardship theory. Data was collected in 2013 and 2014 through project documentation and interviews for four case studies at the Dutch Highways Agency. Collected data was used to analyse the roles of the client and vendor, the scope and level of the products and the overall process of the clarification phase of the Best Value approach to identify barriers in practice. Case study findings are analysed and explained by agency theory and <b>stewardship</b> theory. From <b>a</b> theoretical perspective the Best Value approach shows large similarities with stewardship theory. In practice, however, the cases show that the often traditional background of project teams and the lack of experience with Best Value result in a control-oriented relationship between client and vendor characterized by information asymmetry, lack of transparency and distrust. These characteristics of the relationship between client and vendor inhibit the realization of <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> relation using the Best Value approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of State secondary schools in New Zealand is currently {{measured by the}} schools’ performance measurement systems (PMS). The PMS are established by the schools’ boards of trustees in line with guidelines developed primarily by the Ministry of Education (MoE), while incorporating {{the requirements of the}} Education Review Office (ERO) and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA). The PMS focuses on the {{performance of}} teachers, as well as the principal and the school, but all are assessed from <b>a</b> <b>stewardship</b> oriented <b>perspective,</b> that does not adequately reflect the expectations of a school’s nongovernmental stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to determine the key stakeholders of State secondary schools in New Zealand and identify their key performance factors (KPFs) and associated key performance indicators (KPIs). This research employed a mixed methods approach, guided by the pragmatist paradigm. This study used a sequential research design consisting of a qualitative method (semistructured interviews) followed by a quantitative method (questionnaire). Stakeholder theory provided the theoretical basis for identifying the schools’ stakeholders, and the theory of stakeholder salience gave the rationale for identification of the schools’ key stakeholders. Two performance measurement frameworks, “strategic factors” and the “portfolio approach” informed this research in identifying the KPFs and associated KPIs of the key stakeholders. This research has identified eight key stakeholders of State secondary schools in New Zealand. They include three Crown entities: ERO, MoE, NZQA, “one statutory body” the board of trustees (BOT), and four nongovernmental stakeholder groups: teachers, parents, students, and the community. The schools’ PMS do not adequately reflect the expectations of nongovernmental stakeholders. Thus, this study has chosen to identify the KPFs and associated KPIs of the two most salient nongovernmental stakeholders, i. e., teachers and parents. This research has identified seven KPFs for teachers in addition to a number of KPIs that indicate the status of the KPFs. Four of the seven teachers’ KPFs: 1) workload, 2) safety, 3) support, and 4) resources reflect issues concerning individual teachers. On the basis of these findings, a holistic teachers’ performance management process for schools has been proposed. This process recognises the transactional relationship between management and teachers, required to improve schools’ performances. This study has also identified seven KPFs for parents; the two most salient are “quality teachers” and “communication” as they influence four other parents’ KPFs. The findings of this investigation have implications in two areas: 1) the management of the schools, and 2) the educational policy of the government. School management needs to provide quality teachers, adequate support to teachers and students by improving the “management system” of schools in line with expectations of teachers and parents, while ensuring safety at all times in schools. The government’s education policy should focus on the following: reducing teachers’ nonteaching activities; providing skills to teachers so that they can engage cross-culturally as well as with students from adverse backgrounds, and inducting individuals into the teaching profession who see teaching as a service/dedication to a cause and not merely a means to earn a living. It is expected that a holistic, stakeholder-focused, and transactional relationship between the school and its stakeholders will result in greater engagement between the schools and their stakeholders, leading to beneficial outcomes for both schools and for society at large such as lower truancy, and improved academic achievement...|$|R
