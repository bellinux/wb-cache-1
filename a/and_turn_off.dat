5|$|The {{rendezvous}} and first-ever docking {{between two}} spacecraft was successfully completed after 6.5 hours in orbit. Contact {{with the crew}} was intermittent {{due to the lack}} of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Orbital Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second, which meant the problem was in their Gemini's attitude control. Armstrong decided the only course of action was to engage the Reentry Control System (RCS) <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft would have to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring made one of the thrusters become stuck in the on position.|$|E

25|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) uses implantable electrodes to send high-frequency electrical {{signals to}} the thalamus. The electrodes are implanted as described above. The patient uses a hand-held magnet to turn on <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> a pulse generator that is surgically implanted under the skin. The electrical stimulation temporarily disables the tremor and can be “reversed,” if necessary, by turning off the implanted electrode. Batteries in the generator last about 5 years and can be replaced surgically. DBS is currently used to treat parkinsonian tremor and essential tremor. It is also applied successfully for other rare causes of tremor.|$|E
25|$|For Black Ops, Treyarch {{focused only on}} {{this game}} unlike past practice. However, it had {{different}} teams, each working on separate game modes. Treyarch used a motion capture technology {{similar to the one}} used in James Cameron's film Avatar, which allows accurate facial expressions, capturing the whole performance of the actor. The studio also consulted special forces veterans from both belligerents of the Cold War: Major John Plaster (US Army-Ret.) who served in the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War, and former Soviet special forces operative Sonny Puzikas. The latter taught Treyarch how Spetsnaz soldiers would react in combat, such as rolling out of the line of fire. Spetsnaz AIs in the game have been modeled after him, from his tactics and his movements to his face. Although having a historical background, the classified aspect of these Cold War black operations allowed the studio to create its own fictional story. The game also allows players to turn down the blood <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the profanity.|$|E

2500|$|The third revised {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity Design Consultants, which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star-shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough {{at the base of the}} structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to [...] above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, igniters hidden in the stones would cause the gas to burst into a [...] high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the igniters to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain).|$|E
2500|$|The MCC {{remained}} at Sydney {{to play an}} Australian XI, this was a team of Test hopefuls strengthened {{by the presence of}} a few old hands and led by the prospective Australian captain Neil Harvey following Ian Craig's resignation due to ill-health. It was the custom to play the six batsmen due to be picked for the First Test, but to only use bowlers {{on the edge of the}} Test scene. Peter May won the toss and like Craig in the previous match opted to bat first, only to come at 40/2 which quickly became 40/3 thanks to Barry Fisher (3/59) and Raymond Strauss (4/77) who swung the ball in the heavy atmosphere. After a shaky start himself May settled and made runs with Tom Graveney (70), but a late order collapse in the last session reduced them from 189/3 to 290/7 at stumps, the captain 113 not out. May carried the score to 319 when he was last out for 140, a fine captain's innings. This looked better when the Australian XI crashed to 12/3, May ruining out Gavin Stevens, Peter Loader bowling captain Neil Harvey for a duck and Fred Trueman dismissing Norm O'Neill with a terrific yorker that bruised his foot and caught him l.b.w.. Colin McDonald steadied the ship helped by the front foot [...] "English-style" [...] batting of Peter Burge before Loader (4/23) bowled him for 49 and Bobby Simpson for 2. Jim Laker (4/52) trapped all-rounder Johnny Martin for a duck as they lost 4 wickets for 4 runs. The tail wagged for another 47 runs, but the Australian XI was out for 128. With tired bowlers and an unfit Trueman May failed to enforce the follow on and batted 191 runs ahead. Arthur Milton was the first to go, but Peter Richardson made 52 and Raman Subba Row (68 not out) dug himself in. Peter May played himself in before lunch, then attacked the Australian bowling with [...] "a welter of strokes", He struck Fisher for 42421 off successive balls to take him to 97 and brought up his century with a magnificent cover-drive off Strauss. In the last over before tea he brought up his 100 runs in a session and won £A500 from the Sydney newspaper The Daily Telegraph. May shared half the money with the team and used the other half to throw a party for the two teams and the press. The England captain rarely allowed himself the liberty of cutting the bowling to ribbons, but many thought this was one of his finest displays. He declared on 257/3 when he was bowled by Fisher after tea for 114, leaving the Australian XI 449 to win. Subba Row dropped McDonald off Loader, who retired with a strained Achilles tendon, which allowed his substitute Willie Watson to play his first cricket of the tour. McDonald did not survive long, retiring hurt for 5 with a torn hamstring. Stevens (33) and Harvey (38) took the first wicket partnership to 57 when Trueman bowled the opener and caught O'Neill off Tony Lock. Making the ball bite <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> Trueman's footmarks Lock took 6/29 as Australia crashed to 98/7, Laker (2/30) snapped up the last two wickets and the Australian XI were out for 103 on the last ball of the third day to lose by the crushing margin of 345 runs. The Surrey duo had now taken 44 wickets (17.86) on the tour and put people on mind of the ditty [...] "Here lie the Ashes of '56, skittled by Laker for next to nix". The Australian selectors Sir Donald Bradman and Jack Ryder looked distinctly unhappy as they watched the game and it probably cost Neil Harvey the Australian captaincy, instead they gave it to Richie Benaud.|$|E
