5|$|The moult {{of their}} flight {{feathers}} can cause serious problems for birds, {{as it can}} impair their ability to fly.

5|$|Dalmeny {{opened on}} Christmas 1899 and closed in July 1908, in {{conjunction}} with the farm's relocation to Upstate New York. Over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> months in 1909 the building was moved to the Briarcliff Lodge property, where it was adjacent to the Lodge's laundry building. When the Lodge was the campus of King's College from 1955 to 1994, the school called the former boarding house Harmony Hall and used it for classrooms and staff housing. In autumn 1979, King's College demolished the building shortly after dedicating a new classroom building.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Djajakusuma helped promote {{art forms}} {{such as the}} Betawi lenong and Javanese ludruk over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years. He is {{particularly}} recognised for his revitalising lenong. Beginning in 1968, Djajakusuma appeared on television as an advocate of lenong, which was then limited to rural villages and {{on the verge of}} dying out. He increased popular knowledge of the form while arguing for proper remuneration for performers. Through the 1970s lenong was performed at Ismail Marzuki Hall, drawing considerable audiences, and several lenong performers found mainstream acclaim in the film industry.|$|E

5|$|Nicole and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought great rainfall {{to much of}} Jamaica over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days. A {{maximum of}} 37.42inches (940mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September26 to 30; most other parishes received more than 12in (300mm) during the same period. With a return period of 30years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microburstssmall downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice walking out of the group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg.|$|E
5|$|The exact date {{in which}} Philip II {{initiated}} reforms to radically transform the Macedonian army's organization, equipment, and training is unknown, including {{the formation of}} the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the sarissa). The reforms took place over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years and proved immediately successful against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much Philip II's royal predecessors may have contributed to these military reforms. It is perhaps more likely that his years of captivity in Thebes during the Theban hegemony influenced his ideas, especially after meeting with the renowned general Epaminondas.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|Written over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> {{years and}} {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs {{in its use}} of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several {{of the hallmarks of}} traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.|$|E
5|$|After Andromeda there {{followed}} <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> {{years in}} which Mantua made little use of Monteverdi's services. Duke Ferdinando died on 26 October 1626 and was succeeded by Don Vincenzo, who became Duke Vincenzo II. Early in 1627 Striggio approached Monteverdi with a request for theatrical music, possibly for the festivities that would celebrate Vincenzo's accession. Monteverdi replied offering three options: first, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda ("The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda"), a setting from Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata ("Jerusalem Delivered"), which had been performed at the 1624 Venice Carnival; secondly, a setting from another part of Tasso's poem, covering {{the story of the}} sorceress Armida and her abandonment by the Christian hero Rinaldo; finally, he offered to set the words of a new play by Giulio Strozzi, Licori finta pazza inamorata d'Aminta, about a woman who feigns madness for the sake of love. Monteverdi sent Striggio a copy of Strozzi's play on 7 May 1627; Striggio liked it and instructed Monteverdi to begin the music.|$|E
