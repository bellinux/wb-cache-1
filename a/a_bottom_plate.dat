The winding is impregnated with the polymer precursors to achieve the polymerized conducting polymer to form cathode the polymer electrode, electrically connected to the cathode foil. The winding then is built into an aluminum case and sealed with a rubber sealing. For the SMD version (Vertical chip= V-chip) the case is provided with <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{top plate}} or ceiling plate {{is the top}} of the wall, which sits just below the {{platform}} of the next floor (at the ceiling). The base plate or floor plate is the bottom attachment point for the wall studs. Using a top plate and <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> a wall can be constructed while it lies on its side, allowing for end-nailing of the studs between two plates, and then the finished wall can be tipped up vertically into place atop the wall sill; this not only improves accuracy and shortens construction time, but also produces a stronger wall.|$|E

50|$|Wall {{sections}} usually include <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> {{which is}} secured {{to the structure}} of a floor, and one, or more often two top plates that tie walls together and provide a bearing for structures above the wall. Wood or steel floor frames usually include a rim joist around the perimeter of a system of floor joists, and often include bridging material near the center of a span to prevent lateral buckling of the spanning members. In two-story construction, openings are left in the floor system for a stairwell, in which stair risers and treads are most often attached to squared faces cut into sloping stair stringers.|$|E
5000|$|A food mill (also called passatutto, purée sieve, moulinette, mouli légumes, or passe-vite) is a food {{preparation}} utensil for [...] and sieving soft foods. Typically, a food mill {{consists of three}} parts: a bowl, <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> with holes like those in a colander, and a crank fitted with a bent metal blade which crushes the food and forces it through {{the holes in the}} bottom plate as the crank is turned. The bottom plate may be a permanent part of the device, or interchangeable plates with different hole sizes may be supplied. Three corrugated feet on the base, or two ears on the rim plus the handle, fit on the rim of a cooking pot and hold the mill in position over it.|$|E
50|$|Exterior {{wall studs}} are the {{vertical}} members {{to which the}} wall sheathing and cladding are attached. They are supported on <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> or foundation sill and in turn support the top plate. Studs usually consist of 1.5 x 3.5 in or 1.5 x 5.5 in lumber and are commonly spaced at 16 in on center. This spacing may be changed to 12 or 24 in on center depending on the load and the limitations imposed by the type and thickness of the wall covering used. Wider 1.5 x 5.5 in studs {{may be used to}} provide space for more insulation. Insulation beyond that which can be accommodated within a 3.5 in stud space can also be provided by other means, such as rigid or semi-rigid insulation or batts between 1.5 x 1.5 in horizontal furring strips, or rigid or semi-rigid insulation sheathing to the outside of the studs. The studs are attached to horizontal top and bottom wall plates of 1.5 in lumber that are the same width as the studs.|$|E

50|$|A panini {{press or}} grill is a contact grill for heating sandwiches, meat products, vegetables, and {{specialty}} menu items, nearly always with electric elements, comprising <b>a</b> heated <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> that is fixed, and a heated top plate that closes towards the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> {{and comes in}} contact with the food. The function of the panini grill is to heat food to an appropriate internal temperature with desirable external characteristics (i.e. food safe, melted cheese, crisp finish, grill marks).|$|R
50|$|This is a low-set, single-storeyed, timber-framed {{structure}} with hardwood slab walls and floors and a hipped roof of unlined corrugated iron. Adzed timber rafters and tie beams with few battens support this roof, and the galvanised iron guttering is of early half-round profile. The principal uprights are morticed and tenoned to <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and carry a top plate, {{and the whole}} rests on timber stumps. Split hardwood slabs, both vertical and horizontal, provide the infill between the frames. There are no internal doorways. Slab partitions to ceiling height divide the structure into three rooms, each of which opens onto a verandah which runs {{the length of the}} building on the southwest side. The outer edge of the verandah floor is carried by a ground log. The former kitchen features a cooking alcove and chimney of corrugated iron attached to the end wall. This alcove is clad externally with vertical slabs and has a stone floor. Beyond the kitchen a small iron-roofed lean-to supported by timber posts is attached {{to the rear of the}} fireplace. The building remains substantially intact and has been furnished as a private museum, illustrating a typical bedroom and kitchen of the pioneer era.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013, the Belgian railway company {{cancelled}} {{its contract}} with AnsaldoBreda, after a technical examination {{of a pair}} of V250 train halves. The inspections yielded 1159 and 2019 deficiency points, where a total of 9 per full train was the permitted tolerance before rejection. The report mentioned, amongst others, the following defects: during a test run, an iron plate of the roof bent towards the overhead wire, axles were severely rusted, with a risk of breaking in moving trains, the brakes were not suited for high-speed trains, wiring was not shielded from rain and snow, <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> came loose and fell down on the railtrack, batteries overheated in carriages that had been already taken out of service, resulting in fire and subsequent scorches in the carriages, earthing points were wrongly connected, causing electric driven heavy oxidation, the door sliding mechanisms were faulty, assembly varied from train to train. On the same day the report was published, the Belgian public broadcasting organizations RTBF and VRT got hold of photographs showing the wrecked conditions the V250 trains were in. However, because of major technical problems with these trains, the trains were taken out of rotation within weeks after the start of the service. On the 31st of May 2013, the NMBS/SNCB cancelled the Fyra project entirely. On June 3, NS also announced it was stopping operation of V250 trains. According to their survey of the trains it would take at least 17 months to repair all construction flaws, and entry into service would not be expected before 2018. In addition, even if trains were to be repaired, the maintenance cost would be much higher and the lifetime of the trains much lower than agreed in the contracts with AnsaldoBreda. It is currently unlikely that the V250 will enter commercial service again. In a response to the Dutch and Belgian complaints about damage to the trains, AnsaldoBreda blamed the operators for being irresponsible in running the trains at the certified top speed of 250 km/h in winter, and not performing the recommended daily maintenance. Belgian rail operators claim the latter is not true, and that the problems encountered can only be caused by structural problems with the trains.|$|E

40|$|This Letter {{introduces}} an electrostatically actuated fractal MEMS {{variable capacitor}} that, by utilising the substrate, extends the tuning range (TR) beyond the theoretical limit of 1. 5 as {{dictated by the}} pull-in phenomenon. The backbone concept behind the fractal varactor {{is to create a}} suspended movable plate possessing a specific fractal geometry, and to simultaneously create <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> fixed <b>plate</b> complementary in shape to the top plate. Thus, when the top plate is actuated, it moves towards the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and fills the void present within the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> without touching it akin to how puzzle pieces are assembled. Further, a reasonable horizontal separation is maintained between both the plates to avoid shorting. The electrostatic forces come from the capacitance formed between the top <b>plate</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> and from the capacitance formed between the top plate and the doped substrate.
