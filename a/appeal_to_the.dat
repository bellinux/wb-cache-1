The Vita Sancti Wilfrithi gives a speech, supposedly delivered by Wilfrid there, in defence of Wilfrid's record over the previous 40years. The council was presided over by Berhtwald, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and {{the decision of the}} council was that Wilfrid should be deprived of all his monasteries but Ripon, and that he should cease to perform episcopal functions.
