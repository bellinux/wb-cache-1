5|$|Anne learns {{from an old}} friend, Mrs. Smith (Helen Schlesinger), that Mr. Elliot is {{bankrupt}} {{and only}} interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne <b>also</b> <b>is</b> told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.|$|E

5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, {{but the city}} {{is still one of}} the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence <b>also</b> <b>is</b> the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} industrial centers in Israel. All industrial activities in the city are located in northern areas such as the port area, the northern industrial zone, and around the Lachish River. The port of Ashdod is the largest port in Israel, handling about 60% of Israel's port cargo. It was mainly upgraded in recent years and will be able to provide berths for Panamax ships. Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which <b>also</b> <b>is</b> home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment <b>also</b> <b>is</b> not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it <b>also</b> <b>is</b> possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E
5|$|Columbia is {{also known}} for its MKT Trail, a spur of the Katy Trail State Park, which allows foot and bike traffic across the city, and, conceivably, the state. It {{consists}} of a soft gravel surface for running and biking. Columbia <b>also</b> <b>is</b> preparing to embark on construction of several new bike paths and street bike lanes thanks to a $25 million grant from the federal government. The city is also served by American Airlines at the Columbia Regional Airport, the only commercial airport in mid-Missouri.|$|E

Although the descent is {{predicated}} on going astray, so <b>also</b> <b>is</b> persevering beyond it into the light.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring <b>also</b> <b>is</b> underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about other}} {{subjects}} besides revenues <b>also</b> <b>is</b> {{contained in the}} rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons.

The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It <b>also</b> <b>is</b> possible that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
