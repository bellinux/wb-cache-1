40|$|Background Triage at out-of-hours GP cooperatives (GPCs) {{is aimed}} at {{determining}} medical urgency and guiding decisions. Both medical knowledge and communication skills are required for this complex task. Objective To explore the impact <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and estimated urgency on the appropriateness of decisions. Methods We performed a secondary analysis <b>of</b> telephone triage <b>consultations</b> by nurses at 29 Dutch GPCs. Consultations were taped and assessed by trained observers, using a validated instrument. Measures concerned quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation,</b> nurse-estimated urgency (four levels) and appropriateness of decisions (urgency, follow-up advice and timing). Bivariate analyses and logistic multilevel regression analyses were used to explore the impact <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> (controlling for urgency) on appropriateness of decisions. Results The sample included 6739 telephone contacts, most of which (90 %) were non-urgent. The majority of decisions were appropriate (91 % for urgency, 96 % for follow-up advice and 95 % for timing). In bivariate analyses, appropriateness of decisions {{was positively related to}} higher quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Estimated urgency was negatively associated with quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Logistic multilevel analysis showed that higher quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> was related to a more appropriate estimation of urgency [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 82; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 69 - 1. 95], follow-up advice (OR = 2. 69; 95 % CI: 2. 41 - 3. 01) and timing of decisions (OR = 2. 41; 95 % CI: 2. 20 - 2. 63).

This study {{set out to}} {{test the}} face {{validity}} of prioritized criteria <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence in general practice as contained in the Leicester assessment package. METHOD. A questionnaire {{was sent to a}} geographically stratified random sample of 100 members of the United Kingdom Association of Course Organisers to seek their views on the categories, components and weightings contained in the Leicester assessment package and to determine the proportion of respondents who rejected or suggested a new category, component or weighting or reallocated components to other categories or amended weightings. Their views were sought on a six-point scale (strongly approve, approve, tend to approve, tend to disapprove, disapprove and strongly disapprove). RESULTS. There was a 73 % response rate. Of the respondents 99 % either strongly approved or approved of the overall set <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence. Only two respondents (3 %) expressed any disapproval of individual categories. Thirty five of the 39 suggested components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence were supported by more than 80 % of respondents. There was minimal support for excluding any categories or components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence, for moving any components to different categories or for the inclusion of new categories or components. Eighty eight per cent of respondents were in favour of the need to identify priorities between any agreed categories <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence and 79 % expressed approval of the suggested weightings. Although 42 % of respondents indicated a wish for some alteration in weightings, the mean values for all consultation categories suggested by all respondents were almost identical to the original weightings in the Leicester package. CONCLUSION. The face validity of the categories and components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence contained in the Leicester assessment package has been established, and the suggested weightings <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> categories have been validated. Consequently, the criteria contained in the Leicester package can be adopted with confidence as measures against which performance can be judged in formative or summative assessment <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> performance in general practice...|$|R

Design: Video-recordings <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> with consecutive patients in family practice were studied for duration <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> in relation to age, gender and nature of the problem(s). Setting: Primary health care. Subjects: 405 consecutive consultations were video-taped in the practices of 27 family doctors. Main outcome measures: Length <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and its segments was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The problems were classified according to the ICPC. Results: The average consultation lasted 9. 0 min (+ - 4. 9).

40|$|Consultation is a {{prominent}} indirect service delivery method {{in school psychology}} today. Several publications endorsed by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) have traditionally suggested the mental health, organizational, and behavioral models <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> as the three prominent consultation models {{in the field of}} school psychology. However, no supporting data are cited and it is unclear if these three models are still prominent in school psychology today. The present research examined the consultation literature over the last 22 years in two prominent school psychology journals, Journal of School Psychology and School Psychology Quarterly (originally called Professional School Psychology). This research involved the analysis <b>of</b> 145 <b>consultation</b> articles from the school psychology literature. The data was analyzed to obtain information regarding the frequency <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> articles published, any trend that emerged from this data, the most frequent types <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> mentioned, the type of research conducted, and topics addressed in the articles. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> trends over time indicated a decrease in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> articles published over time in both journals. The terms utilized to address consultation models are greatly varied, demonstrated by the 107 different types <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> referenced in the consultation articles. Clearly, behavioral consultation is the most frequently researched and referenced consultation model in the literature. The results suggested the three traditional prominent models have been modified over time. Mental health consultation and behavioral consultation were consistently found within the top three models researched and referenced; however, organizational consultation was infrequently mentioned in the literature and researched in only 4 % of the articles reviewed for this study. Therefore, it appeared that organizational consultation is no longer considered {{a prominent}} model <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the articles that were not research oriented indicated that 76 % of the articles focused on application <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> The topics <b>of</b> multiculturalism, training, and ethics were the focal point to a lesser extent, with each representing fewer than 5 % of articles.

40|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> between {{senior managers}} and employee representatives {{has a long}} history in British employment relations yet has often been overshadowed by discussions on collective bargaining. In the last few decades, the importance <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> has been elevated by two main trends: the decline in trade union membership and the retreat from collective bargaining in the private sector on the one hand, with the result that consultation may be the only form of collective employee voice available; and the programme of legislative support for consultation by the European Union since the 1970 s on the other. The book charts the meaning and development <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> in the twentieth century and explores the justifications for the practice. It shows how EU intervention to promote consultation evolved and changed, paying particular attention to the adoption of the Information and <b>Consultation</b> <b>of</b> Employees (ICE) Regulations, which became fully operational in enterprises with 50 or more employees in 2008. Analysing the half-hearted response to EU consultation initiatives by the social partners in Britain, it provides a critical assessment of successive UK governments' handling of the issue. Drawing on the authors' empirical research in twenty-five organizations, the book closely examines the take-up and impact <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> regulations, and explores the processes involved in effective consultation. Consultation at Work looks at the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and draws a contrast between 'active' <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> the type envisaged by the EU, and more limited consultation used as a means of communication. Discussing the UK experience in comparative perspectives, it asks what has to happen for the take-up <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> to improve and suggests the changes that should be made to the EU Directive and UK ICE Regulations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} content {{validity}} in Hong Kong of the prioritised criteria <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> {{competence in the}} Leicester Assessment Package (LAP). Design: A detailed questionnaire was sent to doctors with experience of family medicine in Hong Kong to seek {{their views on the}} seven prioritised consultation categories and 39 component competences in the LAP on a six-point scale (strongly approve to strongly disapprove). Respondents also had the opportunity to reject or suggest alternative categories, components and/or weightings. Background demographic and professional data were collected. Subjects: 489 full members of the HKCFP with current Hong Kong postal address. Main outcome measure: The respondents' collated levels of approval <b>of</b> the LAP <b>consultation</b> categories, component competences and weightings and any consensus for changes. Results: There was a response rate of 57 %. Of the respondents 92 %, and 82 % to 97 % either strongly approved or approved of the overall LAP set <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> categories and the individual categories respectively. Thirty-seven of the 39 suggested component competences were supported by more than 80 % of respondents. There was little support for excluding, including or shifting any categories or component competences. Ninety-three percent of respondents were in favour of the need to identify priorities between any categories <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence and 88 % of respondents expressed approval of the suggested weightings. Conclusion: The high levels of approval from respondents suggest that the content validity of the categories and components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence in the LAP has been established in Hong Kong and that the LAP weightings <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> categories have also been validated. Indeed, the results closely correlate with the findings of the original study in the United Kingdom.

The average length <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> was 14 mins, and only slightly lower for fee-for-service (FFS) doctors (13. 7) than for salaried ones (14. 8). The weekly average number <b>of</b> surgery <b>consultations</b> was higher for FFS doctors than for the salaried (63 vs 49), but the weekly number of hours spent consulting and the proportion of return visits were about the same. Further, the characteristics {{of the health care system}} (doctor density and doctor turnover) were associated with variations in the doctors' use of time. The most consistent effects, even if weak, were the age and sex of the patients. The strongest effects on the length <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> were referrals and various medical procedures. This suggests that in this instance the medical condition at hand would appear to have a greater influence on the doctors' use of time than either the remuneration system or other characteristics of the health care system.
