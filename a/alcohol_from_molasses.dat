While at Zamboanga, he {{met and married}} Katrushka (Katsy) Jurika, {{daughter}} of Stephen Jurika, a naturalized Czechoslovakian, and Blanche Walker, of Oxnard, California. At that time, Parsons was 30 years old and Katrushka was only 15, but their marriage was solid and quickly produced three sons — Michael, Peter and Patrick. The Parsons family moved to Manila in 1929, where Charles took a job managing the Luzon Stevedoring Company as [...] "boss stevedore," [...] which operated a fleet of tugboats, chrome and manganese mines, and other activities. Other business interests included managing the North American Trading and Importing Company, which produced <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> <b>molasses</b> discarded from sugar refining, and the La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory, {{one of the largest}} tobacco interests in the Philippines and owned by Spanish royalty. Ironically, due to a Filipino law requiring a 60% American or Filipino interest in a foreign company operating in the Philippines, Parsons also became president of Nihon Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, a Japanese mining company. In 1929, according to Ingham (1945), he also made another important career decision. He joined the U.S. Naval Reserve as a Lieutenant (jg), and took active duty with the Pacific fleet whenever possible. However, Peter Parsons, his son, states that his father joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1932, and was assigned to submarines.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Recycling organic wastes has vital {{roles in}} {{sustainable}} agriculture, reducing pollutants in the environment, and nutrient enrichment of soils. Compost {{is the product}} of recycling organic waste through anaerobic treatment, which can be a good alternative. Again the use of chemical fertilizers is inappropriate. Vinasse is brown material and it is a product of industrial production of <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> <b>molasses.</b> Vinasse, a by-product of ethanol production from molasses, is a highstrength effluent with a high content of organics, mainly organic acids, reducing substances, cultured matter and glycerol. The wastewater is characterized by high concentrations of potassium, calcium, chloride and sulphate ions, a high content of suspended solids, a high CoD (Chemical oxygen Demand) level and a high temperature at the moment of generation. Vinasse {{can be used as a}} supplement for enhancing compost fertilizer quality, because it has plenty of organic matter and minerals. This research was done with the purpose of surveying application of vinasse in different levels on indices of compost producing (temperature, microbial population, nitrogen, carbon, the ratio C/N, nitrate, pH and EC) and producing time in different phases (during the production and after compost production) for 5 months in the waste resumption complex of Aradkooh in Tehran. Materials and Methods: The method used for compost production from solid waste material was ventilating the fixed mass. In this research, the volume of ventilation was 0. 6 lit air for 1 lit waste material in a minute. Four different treatments (each three replicates) were applied to the compost:C 0 without vinasse (control), C 1, C 2 and C 3, respectively 10, 20 and 30 ml vinasse per kg waste material. The following factors were measured during each phase: Total-N was measured by the Kjeldahl method and organic carbon was measured by the Walkley-Black method. Thermometers were used for temperature monitoring at different locations in the riff-raff. The microbial population size was obtained by the CFU method. Electrical conductivity and pH of the water extracts from the samples were determined by shaking the samples mechanically with distilled water at a solid-to-water ratio of 1 : 10 (w/v). Additionally, NO 3 –N was determined by spectrophotometric method. Results and Discussion: At the beginning of this study, theresults showed that, after the formation of the riff-raff, temperature was increasing rapidly all over the riff-raff, which indicates a specified microbial activity. Minimum time to reach the thermophilic temperature, 30 ml per kilogram of vinasse raw materials, was for (C 3) and maximum of them was for the control treatment (C 0). Adding vinass in the second phase led to an increase in the compost mass temperature. Treatment C 3 with the highest and treatment C 0 has the lowest microbial populations. Total nitrogen content increased during composting of the waste materials in comparison with its initial concentration. In both phases treatment C 3 has the highest and treatment C 0 has the lowest total nitrogen content. According to results of the measurements of organic carbon in the first phase, at the beginning of composting process, most of the organic matter was in treatment C 3 and the lowest organic matter was in C 0. However, with increasing the composting process, the vinass treatment had lost jts organic carbon with more gradient. In the second phase by adding vinass, the originally organic carbon increased because of the high levels of organic matter. But,with further vinass treatment, they lost their organic carbon more vigorously. During five months,changes in the ratio of carbon to nitrogen C/Nwas variable. In vinass treatment, the ratio ofC/N increased more vigorously until it reached one quarter and then it fell less sharply. In the first month, this ratio fell less sharply in the control group, and in the final months it fell with more intensity. In the second phase, decreasing the ratio of carbon to nitrogen was observed and the decrease treatment was more than the other treatments. The monthly analysis of riff-raff samples showed that the higher increase in pH mostly occurs in the first month, and in all cases the value of the electrical conductivity increased during composting. Until the second month of pH and EC treatment, C 3 and C 2 increased and decreased in the third to fifth months. In the second phase pH at vinasse treatment increased and pH at C 0 treatment decreased. Maximum amount of nitrate was observed at C 3 treatment and at Epsom salt phase nitrate has the maximum amount. Conclusion: Eventually, it is recognized that treatment C 3 and C 2 it is adequate to add context of organic waste and this treatment decreases the production time of compost up to two months. The second phase was not suitable compared with the first phase due to the inability of increasing nitrate-nitrogen and pH...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of jenever: oude (old) and jonge (young). This {{is not a matter of}} aging, but of distilling techniques. Around 1900, it became {{possible}} to distil a high-grade type of alcohol almost neutral in taste, independent of the origin of the spirit. A worldwide tendency for a lighter and less dominant taste, as well as lower prices, led to the development of blended whisky in Great Britain, and in the Netherlands to Jonge Jenever. During the Great War, lack of imported cereals, and hence malt, forced the promotion of this blend. <b>Alcohol</b> derived <b>from</b> <b>molasses</b> <b>from</b> the sugar beet industry was used as an alternative to grain spirit. People started using the term oude for the old-style jenever, and jonge for the new style, which contains more grain instead of malt and can even contain plain sugar-based alcohol. In modern times, jenever distilled from grain and malt only is labelled Graanjenever. Jonge jenever can contain no more than 15% malt wine and 10 grams of sugar per litre. Oude jenever must contain 'at least' 15% malt wine, but no more than 20 g of sugar per litre. Korenwijn (grain wine) is a drink very similar to the 18th-century-style jenever, and is often matured for a few years in an oak cask; it contains from 51% to 70% malt wine and up to 20 g/l of sugar.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{environmental}} problems faced by the world is management of wastes. Industrial processes create {{a wide range of}} wastewater pollutants; which are not only difficult but costly to treat. Characteristics of wastewater and level of pollutants vary significantly from industry to industry. To control this problem today emphasis is laid on waste minimization and revenue generation through by-product and energy recovery. Pollution prevention focuses on preventing the harmful effect of generated wastewater on the environment, while waste minimization refers to reducing the volume or toxicity of hazardous wastes by water recycling and reuse, process modifications and by by-product recovery. Production of ethyl alcohol in distilleries based on cane sugar molasses constitutes a major industry in Asia and South America. The world’s total production of <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> cane <b>molasses</b> is more than 13 million m 3 /annum. The aqueous distillery effluent stream known as spent wash is a dark brown highly organic effluent and is approximately 12 - 15 times by volume of the product alcohol.
