These sprayers have many advantages compared to other sprayers, but in Iran, their field efficiency is much {{lower than that of}} the developed countries, because the tank volume and consumption of pesticides per hectare is often so highthat spraying per hectare takesa long time for handling the solutions and transporting the sprayers. Also spray droplet size is ordinarily high and its distribution is unknot uniform. So, often spraying and dropping top parts of plants on the earth is inevitable. According to studies carried out in the country during the years 2005 - 2008 in the agricultural research centers in several provinces such as Khuzestan, four types of sprayers including tractor mounted sprayer, atomizer, microner, and electrostatic atomizer were studied and some of the results obtained include the following. From {{the point of view of}} percentage of crash crop, tractor mounted sprayer has the highest percentage, but microner sprayer had the lowest. From the point of view of the solution of consumption amount and spraying cost per hectare, the operation of the tractor mounted sprayer and electrostatic sprayer had the highest and the lowest ranks, respectively. <b>Atomizer</b> <b>sprayer</b> had the highest effect on the percentage amount of weed control, but it requires a high amount of water consumption, high drift and low operation (Safari and Lovaimi, 2010). Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried out during 2012 - 2013 in the field of agricultural research located in the Mollasani city located 20 km near Ahvaz. In this study, tractor mounted spinning disk sprayer (mounted microner sprayer) was evaluated in comparison with conventional boom sprayer on weeds control. The treatments included medium (3500 rpm) and low (2000 rpm) speed rotation disk sprayer and two types of nozzle in conventional boom sprayer. One of them was an Italian tee jet nozzle and the other one was flowage nozzle and they were compared with control treatment. Experiment design was Randomized Completed blocks Design (RCBD) with seven replications. Parameters such as spraying quality, diameter, volume mean diameter and numerical mean of droplets, spray quality factor, the percentage of crash crop, weeds dry weight and number, percentage of weed control and the drift were measured. The results were compared with a control treatment. For comparative tests between the sprayers, the measured parameters were compared with each other using SAS software. Results and Discussion: Volume mean diameter and numerical mean diameter in tractor mounted microner sprayer with medium and low speed rotation disk treatment and also tractor mounted boom sprayer with Italian fan nozzle treatment were metered 162. 5, 461 and 635. 5 micron, and 138. 5, 355 and 452. 5 micron, respectively. Volume mean diameter related to numerical mean diameter was obtained to be 1. 17 and 1. 3 for tractor mounted microner sprayer with medium and low levels of speed rotation disk, and 1. 4 for tractor mounted boom sprayer with Italian fan nozzle, respectively. Whenever the spray quality coefficient is closer to one, the spray quality is better. So microner sprayer treatment with 1. 17 coefficient has the best spray quality. The results about weeds control numbers showed all treatments had significant difference with control treat in 1...|$|E

Computer {{simulation}} provides a means of determining the relative effects of various factors on spray drift while field experiments to measure spray drift have the limitation that many variables cannot be controlled. A Windows Version computer program (DRIFTSIM) was developed to rapidly estimate the mean drift distances of water droplets discharged from <b>atomizers</b> on field <b>sprayers.</b> This program interpolates values from a large data base of drift distances originally calculated for single droplets with a flow simulation program (FLUENT). The simulations of drift distances up to 200 m (656 ft) included temperatures (10 - 30 °C; 50 - 86 °F), discharge heights (0 - 2. 0 m; 0 - 6. 56 ft), initial downward droplet velocities (0 - 50 m/s; 0 - 164 ft/s), relative humidity (10 - 100 %), wind velocities (0 - 10. 0 m/s; 0 - 32. 8 ft/s), droplet sizes (10 - 2000 µm), droplet size distribution in Dv. 1, Dv. 5 and Dv. 9, and 20 % turbulence intensity. Variables can be either in metric or English units. For the input of droplet size distribution, drift distances are reported along with portion of volume in each class such as provided by many droplet size analyzers. The accuracy of the program FLUENT was verified with a uniform droplet generator and wind tunnel. The program indicates the relative effects of the input variables on drift distances and should, especially for large droplets, provide reasonable accuracy for many field applications...|$|R
