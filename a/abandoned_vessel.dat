5|$|The {{sight of}} the burning wrecks in the night once again spread panic {{throughout}} the French fleet, the grounded ships opening a heavy fire on the scuttled ships in the assumption that they were fireships. Captain Lacaille of Tourville was so unnerved that he immediately ordered his crew to abandon ship {{and set it on}} fire. The evacuation was so hasty however that the fires did not spread effectively, and the following morning the ship was found to still be intact, the crew returning to their prematurely <b>abandoned</b> <b>vessel.</b> There they found that the ship's quartermaster Eugéne-Joseph-Romain Bourgeois had remained aboard, unconvinced by Lacaille's order, and had single-handedly driven off an attempt by a British boat to board and capture the ship. During the night about 30 sailors had joined him, keeping Touville in French hands until dawn came {{and the rest of the}} crew returned.|$|E

The UC-45 approached to 2,000 yards before opening fire. The [...] "panic party" [...] of five men rowed away in a small boat, leaving the seemingly <b>abandoned</b> <b>vessel</b> to the Germans. However the submarine, wary of deception, closed to no more 1,000 yards, keeping up a steady and rather inaccurate fire. Result sustained some damage to her sails and rigging, and eventually Mack gave the order to attack, and the aft 12-pounder hit the submarine in the conning tower with its first shot. The 6-pounder also hit the submarine, but it then dived, and the 12-pounders second shot missed. Result then headed for the English coast, but that night encountered another German U-boat. Result fired a torpedo, which missed, and both vessels opened fire, to little effect, before the submarine dived. For his actions Lt. Mack received a mention in despatches.|$|E

60|$|In {{the month}} of December in the year 1873, the British ship Dei Gratia steered into Gibraltar, having in tow the {{derelict}} brigantine Marie Celeste, which had been picked up in latitude 38° 40', longitude 17° 15' W. There were several circumstances {{in connection with the}} condition and appearance of this <b>abandoned</b> <b>vessel</b> which excited considerable comment at the time, and aroused a curiosity which has never been satisfied. What these circumstances were was summed up in an able article which appeared in the Gibraltar Gazette. The curious can find it in the issue for January 4, 1874, unless my memory deceives me. For the benefit of those, however, who may be unable to refer to the paper in question, I shall subjoin a few extracts which touch upon the leading features of the case.|$|E

She had vanished utterly like a dream; and the occurrences of the last twenty-four hours seemed also {{to be a part}} of a vanished dream. The hooded and cloaked figure was part of it, too. It spoke not; it moved not; it would vanish presently. Lingard tried to remember Mrs. Travers' features, even as she sat within two feet of him in the boat. He seemed to have taken from that vanished schooner not a woman but a memory--the tormenting recollection of a human being he would see no more.|$|E

The carpenter was sent to find out how much water there was, and whether it was still gaming, while the other seaman, Allardyce and myself, made a rapid inspection of the vessel and her cargo.|$|E

Then Captain Guy took me on board his ship to see the two ladies, for they wanted to give me instructions themselves. And I tell you what, sir, you don't often see two prettier women on board ship, nor anywhere else, for that matter. Captain Guy told me that before I saw them. He was in great spirits about his luck. He is the luckiest fellow in the merchant service. Now, if I had picked up two people that way, it would have been two old men. But he gets a couple of lovely ladies; that's the way the world goes. The ladies made me pretty nigh swear that I'd never set foot on shore till I found you. I would have been glad enough to stay there all day and make promises to those women; but my time was short, and I had to leave them to Captain Guy. So I did keep a lookout for the Sparhawk, and heard of her from two vessels coming north, and finally fell in with you. And a regular lunatic you were when I took you on board; but that's not to be wondered at; and you seem to be all right now." ...|$|E
