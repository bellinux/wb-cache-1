5|$|Despite these differences, {{all known}} {{naturally}} occurring codes <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar.</b> The coding mechanism {{is the same}} for all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, single direction reading and translating single codons into single amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The 3/4"NGS and 3/4"BSP <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar,</b> {{having the}} same pitch and a pitch {{diameter}} that only differs by about , {{but they are not}} compatible, as the thread forms are different.|$|E
5|$|American crows are the {{new world}} {{counterpart}} to the carrion crow and the hooded crow. Although the American crow and the hooded crow <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia.|$|E
30|$|Crack {{patterns}} <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> for replicate identical shear {{beams and}} <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> for the VC and SCC beams. The diagonal crack widths constant for identical shear and flexural beams indicate {{the consistency of}} the test results.|$|R
50|$|His name <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of}} Latin god Volcanus, {{who himself}} was {{considered}} to be the father of Caeculus and Servius Tullius, not to mention Romulus in the version transmitted by Promathion, which <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the legend of Servius.|$|R
50|$|It {{may also}} contain {{functionality}} that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that in}} another part of a program is required and a developer independently writes code that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to what exists elsewhere. Studies suggest, that such independently rewritten code is typically not syntactically similar.|$|R
5|$|At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all {{date to the}} Late Preclassic. Stylistically, {{the monuments}} <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these {{represent}} complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).|$|E
5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar.</b> The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of}} a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no sexual}} dimorphism. Juveniles <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to adults, but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles {{are also more}} closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} on the chest. Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season, whereas juveniles only have a partial moult, in which they replace a variable number of rectrices.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 {{members of the}} European Parliament (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected {{them as part of}} the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the legislation <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the parliamentary-election legislation, with the main difference being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E

5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to those for}} sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E

5|$|Sculptures of the Potbelly style {{are found}} {{all along the}} Pacific Coast from {{southern}} Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands. Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used {{at the end of}} the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic. The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to those at Monte Alto in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Spectra of {{the main}} ring {{obtained}} by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which {{can be attributed to}} particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8μm and 2.2μm. The spectra {{of the main}} ring <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to Adrastea and Amalthea.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} taxa can {{be divided}} into three main groups; the S. e. caesia group of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the S. e. europaea group of Scandinavia, Russia, Japan and northern China and the S. e. sinensis group of southern and eastern China and Taiwan. These may have been geographically isolated from each other until relatively recently. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the group ranges overlap. The descriptions below are of the male. The female is usually slightly duller with a brown tint to the eyestripe and paler underparts, although the sexes <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in the S. e. sinensis group.|$|E

5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance. The foliages {{of larger}} shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} {{resemble those of}} Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E
