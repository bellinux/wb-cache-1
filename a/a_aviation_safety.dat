40|$|This article {{describes}} how features of event tree analysis and Monte Carlo–based discrete event simulation {{can be combined}} with concepts from object-oriented analysis {{to develop a new}} risk as-sessment methodology, with some of the best features of each.

Each scenario produced by OBEST is automatically associated with a likelihood estimate because proba-bilistic branching is integral to the object model definition. The OBEST methodology is then applied to <b>an</b> <b>aviation</b> <b>safety</b> problem that considers mechanisms by which an aircraft might become involved in a runway incursion incident.

40|$|Bayesian Networks (BNs) {{are widely}} used for {{knowledge}} representation and probabilistic inference in stochastic domains. An attempt {{is made in the}} risk modeling context to develop <b>a</b> general <b>Aviation</b> System Risk Model (ASRM) [16]. Following this initial ASRM, an operational/maintenance ASRM prototype is developed that is based on real case studies [17]. Past and current research efforts focus on multiple case designs in the context of <b>an</b> <b>aviation</b> accident category. Hierarchical Bayesian Networks (HBNs) are an extension to the conventional BN methodology, which provide an expressive power by allowing a node in the network to represent an individual BN. HBNs express the knowledge in a structured way, leading to more realistic probabilistic models. HBNs, like classical BNs, represent a stochastic modeling language, where the random variables symbolize the domain attributes. The probabilistic dependencies among the variables are modeled using directed acyclic graphs. A new case that combines different cases to obtain a single safety enhancement value can be designed using HBNs. The use of HBNs presents a novel application in the <b>aviation</b> <b>safety</b> domain and offers significant promise for risk assessments of <b>an</b> <b>aviation</b> <b>safety</b> product portfolio...|$|R
