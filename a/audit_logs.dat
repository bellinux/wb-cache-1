2500|$|The Greek {{wiretapping}} case of 2004-05, {{also referred}} to as Greek Watergate, involved the illegal telephone tapping of more than 100mobile phones on the Vodafone Greece network belonging mostly to members of the Greek government and top-ranking civil servants. The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange. According to IEEE Spectrum, this was [...] "the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch." [...] The rootkit was designed to patch the memory of the exchange while it was running, enable wiretapping while disabling <b>audit</b> <b>logs,</b> patch the commands that list active processes and active data blocks, and modify the data block checksum verification command. A [...] "backdoor" [...] allowed an operator with sysadmin status to deactivate the exchange's transaction log, alarms and access commands related to the surveillance capability. The rootkit was discovered after the intruders installed a faulty update, which caused SMS texts to be undelivered, leading to an automated failure report being generated. Ericsson engineers were called in to investigate the fault and discovered the hidden data blocks containing the list of phone numbers being monitored, along with the rootkit and illicit monitoring software.|$|E

40|$|Filled with {{valuable}} data such as transactions, {{records and}} confidential information, system logs are lucrative targets for attack. Most computer systems use simple logging schemes that offer no protection after compromise. Various schemes {{have been proposed}} to strengthen logging systems by allowing verification of log integrity, protecting the confidentiality of the contents, and securely relocating logs on remote systems. Such logging systems increase overall system security by preventing certain attacks on the logs and providing accuracy guarantees for post-attack forensics.

40|$|AbstractLog {{management}} and analysis {{is a vital}} part of organization's network {{management and}} system administration. Logs indicate current status of the system and contain information that refers to different security events, which occur within the system. Logs are used for different purposes, such as recording user activities, track authentication attempts, and other security events. Due to increasing number of threats against networks and systems, the number of security logs increases. However, many organizations that work in a distributed environment face following problems: log generation and storage, log protection, and log analysis. Moreover, ensuring that security, system and network administrators analyze log data in an effective way is another issue. In this research, we propose an approach for receiving, storing and administrating <b>audit</b> <b>log</b> events.
