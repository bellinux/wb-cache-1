40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new concept called left (right) g-MP inverse in a $*$-monoid. The relations {{of this type of}} generalized inverse with left inverse <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element are investigated. Also, the reverse order law for the inverse <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element is studied. Then, the existence criteria and formulae of the inverse of the product of triple elements <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element are investigated in a monoid. Finally, we further study left and right g-MP inverses, the inverse <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element in the context of rings. Comment: The inverse <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element, 16 page...|$|R

Since solid data shows dapsone blinding of neutrophilsâ€™ migration <b>along</b> <b>an</b> IL- 8 gradient, similar blinding by dapsone of EOC cells can be expected. IL- 8 figures prominently in the typical intense neovascularization in EOC (Yang et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{prove that the}} {{absorption}} law for one-sided inverses <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element holds, deriving the absorption law for the inverse <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element. We then apply this result to obtain the absorption law for the inverse along different elements. Also, the reverse order law and the existence criterion for the inverse <b>along</b> <b>an</b> element are given by centralizers in a ring. Finally, we characterize the Moore-Penrose inverse by one-sided invertibilities in a ring with involution. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved <b>along</b> <b>a</b> circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth <b>along</b> <b>a</b> larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|M-71 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It serves as a connector between M-21 in Owosso to Interstate69 (I-69) near Durand.

In addition, there are two occurrences of {{original}} M-numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations: all of M-16 became US16 and most of M-10 from Detroit to Saginaw was assumed into the route of US10 in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part <b>along</b> <b>a</b> former or future alignment of US10.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-33 {{like all}} other state trunkline highways in the state. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the traffic <b>along</b> <b>a</b> roadway segment for any average day of the year. In MDOT's surveys in 2009, {{they found that the}} peak AADT along M-33 was the 6,928vehicles a day <b>along</b> <b>a</b> section of the M-72 concurrency. The lowest traffic counts were measured immediately south of the Onaway city limits at 956vehicles daily. The only section of M-33 that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) is the segment concurrent with M-32 in Montmorency County. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E
