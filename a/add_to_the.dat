5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's Blue team, 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RedHawks' Cradle of Coaches plaza.

5|$|Creatively, {{the focus}} of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout {{throughout}} the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, {{which one of the}} characters reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly {{after the event}} that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
5|$|INS Shakti can refuel four ships at a time, with a {{fuelling}} {{speed of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour while her predecessors had {{a speed of}} 300 per hour.

5|$|Jamie Pearson was {{responsible}} for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in slow motion, because the producers felt it would <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tension. The incidental music was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because {{of their ability to}} help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways. Drivers are often drunk and not wearing seat belts. Speeding is common. Deer, elk and moose crossing the highway <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> risk compared to urban highways. In {{the event of}} an accident in a remote area, injured victims may not receive emergency medical care in time to save their lives.|$|E

5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle, {{building a new}} house over the old west range in 1725. However, {{the rest of the}} castle was already decaying.

Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E

5|$|To <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead.
