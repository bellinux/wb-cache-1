40|$|The habitat {{as well as}} the {{unicellular}} thallus {{margins of}} Aneura maxima lead to the assumption that this species could be a hygromorphosis of A. pinguis. Therefore specimens of A. pinguis were cultivated in water. Even after four months the multicellular thallus margins were retained, which proved to be a stable character to separate A. pinguis from <b>A.</b> <b>maxima.</b> Therefore plants even with a small unistratose border, which are attributed to aquatic forms of A. pinguis, may belong to <b>A.</b> <b>maxima.</b> It is supposed that <b>A.</b> <b>maxima</b> was overlooked in Europe but regarded as aquatic forms of A. pinguis named as fo. rivularis. Such plants show unicellular thallus margins and are regarded as hygrophytic form of <b>A.</b> <b>maxima.</b> The presence viz. absence of an unicellular thallus margin seems to be a sufficient character to separate both species. The discussion about the width of the unistratose thallus margin is useless because the type of <b>A.</b> <b>maxima</b> has only 2 - 4 rows of unicellular cells and not 6 - 12 or more as attributed by European hepaticologists. This raises doubts whether the European material is identical with <b>A.</b> <b>maxima</b> rather with <b>A.</b> pellioides from Japan...|$|R

All species of the A. pinguis complex and <b>A.</b> <b>maxima</b> differ in their geographic distribution and habitat preferences. A. pinguis species A grows mainly on humus over limestone rocks in the Western Carpathians, A. pinguis species B occurs mainly on clay soil in Bieszczady Mts. and in clayish areas of lowlands, A. pinguis species C grows both in lowlands and mountains and it occupies mostly wet sandy soils, {{on the shores of}} oligotrophic lakes and river and mountain stream banks, A. pinguis species E is connected with calcareous rocks in flowing water in mountains. <b>A.</b> <b>maxima</b> grows over the country - both in lowlands and mountains, in marshes situated on the river banks...|$|R
