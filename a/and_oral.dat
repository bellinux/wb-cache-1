5|$|Topical <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form {{of vitamin}} B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E

Estimates of <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> pharyngeal residues from the modified barium swallows were generated by a trained observer who was blinded to the scintigraphic data. Positive and significant Spearman correlations between <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> pharyngeal residue measures from scintigraphy <b>and</b> observations of <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> pharyngeal residues from modified barium swallows were found. This supports the validity of observations of <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> pharyngeal residues in clinical studies. Limitations of these observations are discussed...|$|R

5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E

5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
