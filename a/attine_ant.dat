50|$|In {{an early}} 2015 {{published}} study, scientists collected all five species of Escovopsis from both genera of fungus-growing ants, Atta and Acromyrmex, four of {{which came from}} ant colonies in Brazil and the fifth of which came from Trinidad.

The research revealed another Escovopsis species (E. trichodermoides) isolated and derived from the lower <b>attine</b> <b>ant,</b> Mycocepurus goeldii.

During a survey for Escovopsis species in gardens of the lower <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> Mycetophylax morschi in Brazil, we found four strains belonging to the pink-colored Escovopsis clade.

Based on the type of conidiogenesis (sympodial), as well as morphology of conidiogenous cells (percurrent), non-vesiculated conidiophores, and DNA sequences, we describe the four new strains as a new species, Escovopsis kreiselii sp. nov.

Actinobacterial species belonging to the genera Pseudonocardia, Streptomyces and Amycolatopsis have been isolated from <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> nests and shown to confer protection against a range of microfungal weeds. In previous work on the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus we isolated a Streptomyces strain that produces candicidin, consistent with another report that attine ants use Streptomyces-produced candicidin in their fungiculture. Here we report the genome analysis of this Streptomyces strain and identify multiple antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. We demonstrate, using gene disruptions and mass spectrometry, that this single strain {{has the capacity to}} make candicidin and multiple antimycin compounds. Although antimycins have been known for > 60 years we report the sequence of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the first time. Crucially, disrupting the candicidin and antimycin gene clusters in the same strain had no effect on bioactivity against a co-evolved nest pathogen called Escovopsis that has been identified in ~ 30 % of <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> nests. Since the Streptomyces strain has strong bioactivity against Escovopsis we conclude that it must make additional antifungal(s) to inhibit Escovopsis. However, candicidin and antimycins likely offer protection against other microfungal weeds that infect the attine fungal gardens. Thus, we propose that the selection of this biosynthetically prolific strain from the natural environment provides A. octospinosus with broad spectrum activity against Escovopsis and other microfungal weeds...|$|E

However, no studies systematically addressed the putative association of Trichoderma with attine ants, especially in non-leafcutter ants. Here, a total of 62 strains of Trichoderma were analyzed using three molecular markers (ITS, tef 1 and rpb 2). In addition, 30 out of 62 strains were also morphologically examined. The strains studied correspond to the largest sampling carried out so far for Trichoderma in the <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> environment.

I characterize the transcriptomes, conduct phylogenetic analyses, and search for genes of interest, most importantly arginine biosynthesis pathway genes, the absence of which in A. megacephala strongly suggests that <b>attine</b> <b>ants</b> became dependent on their fungi early in their evolution. In Chapter Two I address the phylogenomics of Sericomyrmex, sequencing ~ 990 ultra-conserved-element loci for 88 Sericomyrmex samples. Maximum-likelihood and species-tree phylogenetic methods recover nearly identical topologies across data sets, identifying nine species-level lineages. Divergence-dating analyses indicate that Sericomyrmex {{is the product of}} a recent, rapid radiation, with a crown-group age estimate of 4. 3 million years.

Here we test 4 key assumptions of this Pseudonocardia-Escovopsis coevolution model. Culture-dependent and culture-independent (tag-encoded 454 -pyrosequencing) surveys reveal that several Pseudonocardia species and occasionally Amycolatopsis (a close relative of Pseudonocardia) co-occur on workers from a single nest, contradicting the assumption of a single pseudonocardiaceous strain per nest. Pseudonocardia can occur on males, suggesting that Pseudonocardia could also be horizontally transmitted during mating. Pseudonocardia and Amycolatopsis secretions kill or strongly suppress ant-cultivated fungi, contradicting the previous finding of a growth-enhancing effect of Pseudonocardia on the cultivars. <b>Attine</b> <b>ants</b> therefore may harm their own cultivar if they apply pseudonocardiaceous secretions to actively growing gardens. Pseudonocardia and Amycolatopsis isolates also show nonspecific antifungal activities against saprotrophic, endophytic, entomopathogenic, and garden-pathogenic fungi, contrary to the original report of specific antibiosis against Escovopsis alone. We conclude that attine-associated pseudonocardiaceous bacteria do not exhibit derived antibiotic properties to specifically suppress Escovopsis. We evaluate hypotheses on nonadaptive and adaptive functions of attine integumental bacteria, and develop an alternate conceptual framework to replace the prevailing Pseudonocardia-Escovopsis coevolution model.

In {{order to better}} understand the evolution of ant agriculture, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed transcriptomes of four different <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> species in two genera: three species in the higher-attine genus Sericomyrmex and a single lower-attine ant species, Apterostigma megacephala, representing the first genomic data for either genus. These data were combined with published genomes of nine other ant species and the honey bee Apis mellifera for phylogenomic and divergence-dating analyses. The resulting phylogeny confirms relationships inferred in previous studies of fungus-farming ants. Divergence-dating analyses recovered slightly older dates than most prior analyses, estimating that attine ants originated 53. 6 - 66. 7 million of years ago, and recovered a very long branch subtending a very recent, rapid radiation of the genus Sericomyrmex. This result is further confirmed by a separate analysis of the three Sericomyrmex species, which reveals that 92. 71 % of orthologs have 99 % - 100 % pairwise-identical nucleotide sequences.

Loss of the ability to produce the amino acid arginine has been hypothesized to contribute to the obligate dependence of attine ants upon their cultivated fungi, but the point in fungus-farming ant evolution at which these losses occurred has remained unknown.

40|$|Summary. Raids by {{the army}} ant Neivamyrmex rugulosus (tribe Ecitonini) on a nest {{aggregation}} of the fungus-grow-ing ant Trachymyrmex arizonensis (tribe Attini) resulted in major brood loss and partial destruction of the fungus-gar-dens in the attacked nests. T. arizonensis workers attempted to rescue their brood by carrying them to ad-hoc shelters under rocks above ground, but the army ants pursued the workers to retrieve much of the brood. Raids on single colonies lasted about half an hour, after which the escaped T. arizonensis workers returned to their nest with any res-cued brood. Raids on single nests occurred repeatedly dur-ing the 24 -hour period the army ants swept through the T. arizonensis nest aggregation.

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} a peculiar fungus-coating {{behavior of the}} <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> Mycetosoritis clorindae, where workers plant fungal mycelium on hibernating nestmates. Hiber-nating nestmates become ultimately enveloped in a live mycelial coat, remain motionless in this coated state, and essentially become integrated into the garden matrix. The shallow nest architecture of M. clorindae (depth of main garden is 15 – 30 cm) in southern Brazil forces the ants to overwinter at relatively low temperatures in the topmost soil layer. Fungal coating may help the ants to survive the prolonged periods of immobility during winter. Fungus-planting on attine adults is so far unknown from other attine species, but the behavior parallels the planting of mycelium on larvae and pupae occurring in many attine species. Planting of mycelium on adult nestmates may have been overlooked so far in attine ants because this behavior may occur only in dormant nests, which are least fre-quently collected. The possible adaptive functions of fungus coatings of hibernating adults and developing brood are likely similar, including for example physical protec-tion, prevention of desiccation, shielding against parasites and predators (e. g., army ants), or defense against diseases...|$|E

This is because mating in social insects {{is often difficult to}} manipulate experimentally, and first evidence for an explicit influence of accessory gland secretions on male mating success in social insects was obtained only recently. Here we perform a comparative analysis of male sexual organs across 11 species of <b>attine</b> fungus-growing <b>ants,</b> representing both genera with single- and multiple-queen mating. We found that the general morphology of the male sexual organs was very similar across all species, but the relative sizes of the accessory glands and the sperm-containing accessory testes vary significantly across species. Small testes and large accessory glands characterize species with singly mated queens, whereas the opposite is found in species with multiply mated queens. However, in the social parasite Acromyrmex insinuator, in which queens have secondarily reverted to single mating, males have accessory gland characteristics reminiscent of the lower <b>attine</b> <b>ants,</b> but without having significantly reduced their investment in sperm production.

Alfred Moeller was undertaking a detailed study of local fungi for the Berlin Academy. His two-year field work in 1890 and 1891 resulted in his elaborate publication about <b>attine</b> <b>ants</b> and fungus entitled [...] "The mushroom garden of some South American ants" [...] about several fungus species in ant gardens.|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} roles {{played by}} yeasts in <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> nests are mostly unknown. Here we present our investigations {{on the plant}} polysaccharide degradation profile of 82 yeasts isolated from fungus gardens of Atta and Acromyrmex species to demonstrate that yeasts found in ant nests may {{play the role of}} making nutrients readily available throughout the garden and detoxification of compounds that may be deleterious to the ants and their fungal cultivar. Among the yeasts screened, 65 % exhibited cellulolytic enzymes, 44 % exhibited pectinolytic activity while 27 % and 17 % possess enzyme systems for the degradation of protease and amylase, respectively. Galacturonic acid, which had been reported in previous work to be poorly assimilated by the ant fungus and also to {{have a negative effect on}} ants’ survival, was assimilated by 64 % and 79 % of yeasts isolated from nests of A. texana and Acromyrmex respectively. Our results suggest that yeasts found in ant nests may participate in generation of nutrients and removal of potentially toxic compounds, thereby contributing to the stability of the complex microbiota found in the leaf-cutting ant nests...|$|E
40|$|In {{tropical}} forest systems, attine ants are the dominant herbivores. They construct large nest structures that include foraging trails that extend to multiple plant sources throughout the forest. These foraging areas vary from nest to nest {{and they are}} highly dynamic over time and season changes. It was expected that characteristics of both the nest structure and the surrounding environment would affect the size of nest foraging areas. In this study, COMPASS survey software and ArcGIS were used to map the foraging trails and calculate the foraging areas of 12 <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> nests located on the Firestone Reserve, {{over the course of}} 6 weeks. Data collected at the ant nest sites on nest area, flow rate, trail number and neighboring nest proximity were combined with data collected from previous studies on soil pH and light fractions in order to test correlation hypotheses between these factors and foraging area. The mean foraging areas differed significantly from each other and significant correlations were found between foraging area and trail number, flow rate, neighbor distance and soil pH. Understanding foraging behavior of attine ants is important in the field of restoration ecology because these ants are important in determining overall structure and nutrient distribution in {{tropical forest}}s...|$|E
40|$|Fungus-growing ants in {{the tribe}} Attini {{represent}} {{a classic example}} of a mutualism. These ants obligately depend on fungus as their major food source, while the fungus receives both vegetative substrate (nourishment) from the ants and protection from pathogens. Here, we try to identify both benefits and costs of the association by using cultivar switch experiments. We assessed the benefits to each mutualistic partner by replacing the native fungus (cultivar) used by the primitive <b>attine</b> <b>ant</b> species Cyphomyrmex muelleri with a novel cultivar, that of the closely related ant species Cyphomyrmex longiscapus. We show that interspecific cultivar switches caused a significant decline in worker number, garden biomass, and the number of reproductives produced by colonies. In contrast, these effects were not seen in intraspecific switches. We also examined possible costs of the mutualistic association. We estimated colony sex ratios for C. longiscapus to determine whether cultivars can bias reproductive allocation toward females; such bias may evolve because only female reproductives can disperse the fungus, and males are therefore of no value to the fungus. However, intraspecific cultivar switches did not significantly affect ant sex ratios. Cultivar switch experiments represent a new tool for studying cooperation, conflict, and coevolution between mutualistic partners in the attine ant-fungus symbiosis. Copyright 2006.

40|$|Abstract Fungus-growing ants (Attini) {{live in an}} obligate {{mutualism}} {{with the}} fungi they cultivate for food. Because of the obligate nature of this relationship, {{the success of the}} ants is directly dependent on their ability to grow healthy fungus gardens. <b>Attine</b> <b>ants</b> have evolved com-plex disease management strategies to reduce their garden’s exposure to potential parasitic microbes, to prevent the establishment of infection in their gardens, and to remove infected garden sections. The infrabuccal pocket, a filtering device located in the oral cavity of all ants, {{is an integral part of}} the mechanisms that leaf-cutter ants use to prevent the invasion and spread of general microbial parasites and the specific fungal-garden parasite Escovopsis. Fungus-growing ants carefully groom their garden, collecting general debris and pathogenic spores of Escovopsis in their infrabuccal pocket, the contents of which are later expelled in dump chambers inside the nest or externally. In this study we examined how a phyloge-netically diverse collection of <b>attine</b> <b>ants</b> treat their infrabuccal pellets. Unlike leaf-cutters that deposit their infrabuccal pellets directly in refuse piles, ants of the more basal attine lineages stack their infrabuccal pellets in piles located close to their gardens, and a separate caste of workers is devoted to the construction, management, and eventual disposal of these piles...|$|R
30|$|Our {{observation}} of basidiocarp collections by <b>attine</b> <b>ants</b> raises obvious questions {{relating to the}} origin of fungiculture. The ‘Consumption First’ model (Weber 1972) postulates that a fungus species which was at first collected and directly consumed by ants might have become a mutualistic symbiont over time, once the ants had become capable of cultivating it and transmitting it to their offspring. More detailed field observations should be conducted to assess the frequency of basidiocarp collection by A. lobicornis in nature. Fungus gardens of basidiocarp-collecting colonies should be analysed {{for the presence of}} these basidiomycetes using microbiological or molecular biological methods.|$|R
40|$|Ant fungus farming {{has become}} a {{prominent}} model for studying the evolution of mutualistic cooperation, with recent advances in reconstructing the evolutionary origin and elaborations of the symbiosis (1, 2), discovering additional partners and clarifying their interactions (3, 4), and analyzing host–symbiont conflict suppression (5). The <b>attine</b> <b>ants</b> are rivaled in their farming sophistication only by the Macrotermitinae, which evolved a similar obligate dependence on fungus gardens (6). The discovery of new antagonistic and mutualistic partners in the attine symbiosis has attracted wide attention, but the prevailing coevolutionary paradigm behind key components of this mutualism is now challenged by a study by Sen et al. {{in this issue of}} PNAS (7...|$|R
