25|$|The {{evolution}} of sexual reproduction {{as well as}} its maintenance, is another mystery in biology. The purpose of sexual reproduction is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (ﬁtness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction. Mating types (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of <b>anisogamy</b> (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before <b>anisogamy.</b> It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary mating system, and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that sexual selection drives speciation (the formation of species); without sexual reproduction it is unlikely that complex life would have evolved.|$|E
25|$|While the {{evolution}} of sex dates to the prokaryote or early eukaryote stage, the origin of chromosomal sex determination may have been fairly early in eukaryotes (see Evolution of <b>anisogamy).</b> The ZW sex-determination system is shared by birds, some fish and some crustaceans. XY sex determination is used by most mammals, but also some insects, and plants (Silene latifolia). X0 sex-determination is found in certain insects.|$|E
25|$|In many organisms, the haploid stage {{has been}} reduced to just gametes {{specialized}} to recombine and form a new diploid organism; in others, the gametes are capable of undergoing cell division to produce multicellular haploid organisms. In either case, gametes may be externally similar, particularly in size (isogamy), or may have evolved an asymmetry such that the gametes are different in size and other aspects (<b>anisogamy).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Robert Trivers {{published}} an influential paper on sex differences {{that is now}} referred to as parental investment theory. The size differences of gametes (<b>anisogamy)</b> is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes – sperm) and females (large gametes – ova). Trivers noted that <b>anisogamy</b> typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the sexual selection of different reproductive strategies between the sexes and to sexual conflict. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete {{for access to the}} higher-investing sex to increase their inclusive fitness (also see Bateman's principle). Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution sexual dimorphisms in mate choice, intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and courtship displays. In mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.e. gestation followed by childbirth and lactation). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.|$|E
25|$|Organisms of {{many species}} are {{specialized}} into {{male and female}} varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), {{but in many cases}} an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as <b>anisogamy).</b>|$|E
25|$|Bateman's principle, in {{evolutionary}} biology, {{is that in}} most species, variability in reproductive success (or reproductive variance) is greater in males than in females. It was first proposed by Angus John Bateman (1919–1996), an English geneticist. It {{can be seen as}} the result of <b>anisogamy.</b> Bateman suggested that, since males are capable of producing millions of sperm cells with little effort, while females invest much higher levels of energy in order to nurture a relatively small number of eggs, the female plays a significantly larger role in their offspring's reproductive success. Bateman’s paradigm thus views females as the limiting factor of parental investment, over which males will compete in order to copulate successfully.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "libertine bubble theory" [...] {{proposes that}} meiotic sex evolved in proto-eukaryotes {{to solve a}} problem that {{bacteria}} did not have, namely a large amount of DNA material, occurring in an archaic step of proto-cell formation and genetic exchanges. So that, rather than providing selective advantages through reproduction, sex could {{be thought of as a}} series of separate events which combines step-by-step some very weak benefits of recombination, meiosis, gametogenesis and syngamy. Therefore, current sexual species could be descendants of primitive organisms that practiced more stable exchanges in the long term, while asexual species have emerged, much more recently in evolutionary history, from the conflict of interest resulting from <b>anisogamy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that a disadvantage of sexual reproduction is that a sexually reproducing organism will {{only be able to}} pass on 50% of its genes to each offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are haploid. This, however, conflates sex and reproduction which are two separate events. The [...] "two-fold cost of sex" [...] may more accurately be described as the cost of <b>anisogamy.</b> Not all sexual organisms are anisogamous. There are numerous species which are sexual and do not have this problem because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are isogamous sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes. Both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycle and have a 100% chance of passing their genes into their offspring.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anisogamy</b> is the {{phenomenon}} of fertilization of large gametes (egg cells, ova) by (or with) small gametes (sperm cells: spermatozoa or spermatia). Gamete size difference is the fundamental difference between females and males. <b>Anisogamy</b> first evolved in multicellular haploid species after the differentiation of different mating types had already been established. However, in Ascomycetes, <b>anisogamy</b> evolved from isogamy before mating types.|$|E
50|$|The IR {{model for}} the {{development}} of <b>anisogamy</b> is named after its developers Priya Iyer and Joan Roughgarden. By considering the evolution of <b>anisogamy</b> in hermaphroditic marine invertebrates and bisexual plants, the theory postulates of a gene locus which controls both sperm and egg size produced by an organism. <b>Anisogamy</b> could evolve in diploid hermaphroditic adults as an individual adaptation which increases its own fitness.|$|E
5000|$|Monogamy {{may have}} arisen as a {{consequence}} of <b>anisogamy</b> and other ecological factors. <b>Anisogamy</b> is a form of sexual reproduction which involves the fusion of two unequally sized gametes.

50|$|The {{three main}} {{theories}} for {{the evolution of}} <b>anisogamy</b> are gamete competition, gamete limitation, and intracellular conflicts, but the last of these three is not well supported by current evidence. Both gamete competition and gamete limitation assume that <b>anisogamy</b> originated through disruptive selection acting on an ancestral isogamous population with external fertilization, due to a trade-off between larger gamete number and gamete size (which in turn affects zygote survival), because the total resource one individual can invest in reproduction is assumed to be fixed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anisogamy</b> {{generally}} produces zygotes that inherit cytoplasmic elements {{exclusively from}} the female gamete. Thus, males represent dead-ends to these genes.

50|$|<b>Anisogamy</b> (also called heterogamy) is {{the form}} of sexual {{reproduction}} that involves the union or fusion of two gametes, which differ in size and/or form. (The related adjectives are anisogamous and anisogamic). The smaller gamete {{is considered to be}} male (sperm cell), whereas the larger gamete is regarded as female (egg cell).|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>anisogamy.</b> Both gametes may be flagellated and {{therefore}} motile. Alternatively, both of the gametes may be non-flagellated. The latter situation occurs in some algae and plants. In the red alga Polysiphonia, non-motile eggs are fertilized by non-motile sperm. In flowering plants, the gametes are non-motile cells within gametophytes.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} isogamy {{was the first}} stage of sexual {{reproduction}}. In several lineages, this form of reproduction independently evolved to <b>anisogamy</b> with gametes of male and female types to oogamy. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Oogamous species, {{which include}} humans {{in which the}} female gamete is very {{much larger than the}} male and has no ability to move.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the earliest sexual dimorphism is the size differentiation of sperm and eggs (<b>anisogamy),</b> but the evolutionary significance of sexual dimorphism {{is more complex than}} that would suggest. <b>Anisogamy</b> and the usually large number of small male gametes relative to the larger female gametes usually lies in the development of strong sperm competition, because small sperm enable organisms to produce a large number of sperm, and make males (or male function of hermaphrodites) more redundant. This intensifies male competition for mates and promotes the evolution of other sexual dimorphim in many species, especially in vertebrates including mammals. However, in some species, the females can be larger than males, irrespective of gametes, and in some species females (usually of species in which males invest a lot in rearing offspring and thus no longer considered as so redundant) compete for mates in ways more usually associated with males.|$|E
5000|$|As stated above, {{some members}} of Blastocladiomycota exhibit {{alternation}} of generations. Members of this phylum also exhibit a form of sexual reproduction known as <b>anisogamy.</b> [...] <b>Anisogamy</b> is the fusion of two sexual gametes that differ in morphology, usually size. In Allomyces, the thallus (body) is attached by rhizoids, and has an erect trunk on which reproductive organs are formed {{at the end of}} branches. During the haploid phase, the thallus forms male and female gametangia that release flagellated gametes. Gametes attract one another using pheromones and eventually fuse to form a Zygote. The germinated zygote produces a diploid thallus with two types of sporangia: thin-walled zoosporangia and thick walled resting spores (or sporangia). The thin walled sporangia release diploid zoospores. The resting spore serves as a means of enduring unfavorable conditions. When conditions are favorable again, meiosis occurs and haploid zoospores are released. These germinate and grow into haploid thalli that will produce “male” and “female” gametangia and gametes.|$|E
