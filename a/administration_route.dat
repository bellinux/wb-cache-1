2500|$|Although {{promoted}} {{as a way}} of customizing treatment, hormone therapy does not require customization; the use of testing to determine the amount of hormones administered could result in the dose being higher than the minimum recommended level to alleviate symptoms, or the administration of unnecessary hormones to asymptomatic women may result in greater risks to the patient. [...] In addition, analysis of the material used to promote BHRT suggests that rather than basing hormone doses on saliva results, practitioners are actually adjusting the dose based on symptoms. [...] Health practitioners customize the care of their patients on an ongoing basis by choosing the medication, dose and <b>administration</b> <b>route</b> individually, using approved medications that have a demonstrated safety record and are not subject to the errors and inconsistencies of custom-prepared combinations. [...] Different bioidentical preparations result in mixtures with different strengths, and practitioners using compounded formulations may be unaware of the total dose of hormones their patients receive. [...] In a 2001 test of compounded bioidentical hormone products, the FDA found that 10 out of 29 products failed their quality tests; nine out of ten failed potency tests (comparable rates for drug manufacturers were less than 2% and 0.13%, respectively) A 2006 test found potency levels ranging from 67.5% to 268.4% of the potency specified on the label; some samples were mixtures of different hormones with some being above, and others below, the specified potency. [...] The failure of potency testing could be problematic and dangerous for progesterone products, where specific levels of progesterone are required to protect the endometrium against precancerous hyperplasia.|$|E

50|$|The classic medical {{improvisation}} for {{an infusion}} pump {{is to place}} a blood pressure cuff around a bag of fluid. The battlefield equivalent is to place the bag under the patient.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of cefmetazole, a new parenteral cephalosporin, administered intravenously and intramuscularly at {{a dose of}} 30 mg/kg to {{two groups}} of seven healthy volunteers were studied. Concentrations in serum were monitored over 8 h by a high-pressure liquid chromatography technique. The plasma concentration-time data were statistically fitted to a biexponential equation for both <b>administration</b> <b>routes,</b> and the data were analyzed by a two- and one-compartment kinetic model, respectively. For the dose range and the <b>administration</b> <b>routes</b> used, the pharmacokinetics of cefmetazole proved to be essentially linear, with clearances from plasma ranging between 3. 8 and 12. 5 liters/h. The mean maximum concentration in plasma after intramuscular administration of the drug was 90. 1 micrograms/ml at 0. 7 h.

50|$|Small {{molecular}} direct thrombin inhibitors (smDTIs) are non-peptide {{small molecules}} that specifically and reversibly inhibit both free and clot-bound thrombin by binding to the active {{site of the}} thrombin molecule. They prevent VTE in patients undergoing hip- and knee replacement surgery. The advantages {{of this type of}} DTIs are that they do not need monitoring, have a wide therapeutic index and the possibility of oral <b>administration</b> <b>route.</b> They are theoretically more convenient than both vitamin K antagonist and LMWH. Researches will, however, have to show the indication of the use and their safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} methamphetamine are {{proportional}} to {{the rate at which}} the blood level of the drugs increases. Consequently, the <b>administration</b> <b>route</b> affects the risk for psychological dependence and addiction independently of other risk factors, such as dosage and frequency of use. Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, use of a suppository (rectal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting a powderized form), and ingestion (swallowing). While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires up to half an hour before the initial high sets in.|$|E
50|$|Warfarin {{treatment}} requires blood {{monitoring and}} dose adjustments regularly {{due to its}} narrow therapeutic window. If supervision isn't adequate warfarin poses a threat in causing, all too frequent, haemorrhagic events and multiple interactions with food and other drugs. Currently, the main problem with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the <b>administration</b> <b>route,</b> as {{it has to be}} given subcutaneously. Because of these disadvantages there has been an urgent need for better anticoagulant drugs. For a modern society, convenient and fast drug administration is the key to a good drug compliance. In 2008 the first direct Xa inhibitor was approved for clinical use. Direct Xa inhibitors are just as efficacious as LMWH and warfarin but they are given orally and don’t need as strict monitoring. Other Xa inhibitors advantages are rapid onset/offset, few drug interactions and predictable pharmacokinetics. The rapid onset/offset effect greatly reduces the need for “bridging” with parenteral anticoagulants after surgeries. Today there are three factor Xa inhibitors marketed: rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban.|$|E
30|$|To sum up, {{investigating}} the bio-distribution of metallic NPs might {{help us to}} screen the safest metallic nanomaterials and <b>administration</b> <b>routes</b> that can protect the brain from being affected by NPs.

In addition, studies should be conducted to comprehensively investigate the relationship between exposure to metallic NPs during pregnancy and fetal brain development.|$|R
30|$|As for in vivo studies, the <b>administration</b> <b>routes</b> play an {{important}} part on neurotoxicity of NPs [111, 112]. The Ti contents in the brain regions of mice/rats could not be detected when the TiO 2 NPs were administrated via intravenous injection [73 – 75, 113]. But when the pregnant mice were treated with TiO 2 NPs, their uterine weights were lowered with smaller fetuses, which indirectly suggested that the TiO 2 NPs could induce fetal resorption and retard fetal growth via intravenous injection [67]. Ti could not be detected in the brain when mice were exposed to TiO 2 NPs by inhalation [114]. Based on current studies, the intranasal instillation or nasal administration was the most effective pathway for TiO 2 NPs to be translocated into the brain [16]. This {{might be due to}} the retrograde axonal translocation of NPs directly from the nose to the brain. Therefore, more researches are needed to investigate how and why the different <b>administration</b> <b>routes</b> lead to different NP bio-distributions.|$|R
40|$|The {{adequate}} {{treatment of}} pain {{remains one of}} the major medical challenges. Morphine and other opioid drugs are most commonly used to counteract moderate to severe pain, but they are also increasingly accessed by patients with chronic non-malignant pain. To achieve long-term analgesia, opioid therapy still represents the standard treatment for chronic pain alleviation. This work presents an overview of current strategies aiming at controlled opioid release. Two important, and intrinsically linked, features are discussed in detail: the used formulations (i. e. polymer systems) and the applied drug <b>administration</b> <b>routes.</b> The different <b>administration</b> <b>routes</b> and their associated advantages and limitations are described. Links between the chemical structure of commonly used opioids and suited administration modes and formulations are made. This review can potentially give insight into new opportunities for adequate relief of chronic pain, a societal burden, by means of alternative (non) opioid analgesics and may serve as inspiration for future developments in this area...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} I-440 designation used [...] "inner" [...] and [...] "outer" [...] labels {{rather than}} {{east and west}} labels because the freeway made a full loop around the city. [...] "Inner" [...] was used to designate the clockwise direction around the beltline, and [...] "outer" [...] was used to designate counterclockwise. In 2008, State Highway Administrator W. F. Rosser asked the US Department of Transportation to remove the I-440 designation from the southern portion of the beltline, where it was cosigned with I-40. This decision was primarily made to prevent confusion of travelers who used the highway. On November 10, 2008, I-440 was officially truncated on the western end at the I-40/US 1/US 64 interchange in western Raleigh and at the I-40 interchange in southeast Raleigh. The inner and outer labels were also dropped and replaced with east and west designations. The Federal Highway <b>Administration</b> <b>route</b> log has been updated to show the shortened distance.

5000|$|Some drugs may be {{unsuitable}} for administration by the oral route. For example, protein {{drugs such as}} insulin may be denatured by stomach acids. Such drugs cannot be made into tablets. Some drugs may be deactivated by the liver when they are carried there from the gastrointestinal tract by the hepatic portal vein (the [...] "first pass effect"), making them {{unsuitable for}} oral use. Drugs which can be taken sublingually are absorbed through the oral mucosa, so that they bypass the liver and are less susceptible to the first pass effect. The oral bioavailability of some drugs may be low due to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Such drugs {{may need to be}} given in very high doses or by injection. For drugs that need to have rapid onset, or that have severe side effects, the oral route may not be suitable. For example, salbutamol, used to treat problems in the respiratory system, can have effects on the heart and circulation if taken orally; these effects are greatly reduced by inhaling smaller doses direct to the required site of action. A proportion of the population have difficulties swallowing tablets either because they just don't like taking them or because their medical condition makes it difficult for them (dysphagia, vomiting). In such instances it may be better to consider alternative dosage form or <b>administration</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{application}} of nanotechnologies to the cancer field for therapeutic, imaging or diagnostic purposes represents an advanced and very attractive approach {{to overcome the}} main limits related to conventional chemotherapy.

EXPERT OPINION: Although intravenous injection remains the most investigated <b>route</b> of <b>administration</b> for 'nanoncologicals', research interest towards less explored <b>administration</b> <b>routes</b> allowing localised chemotherapy or delivery in close proximity to the tumour site might change the way cancer is treated in the near future. Nevertheless, an experimental set-up more biologically oriented taking into account an in-depth evaluation of stability in complex media, protein interaction, and cell interaction of novel nanoconstructs could allow their successful translation in pre-clinical and clinical settings...|$|R

Methods: This study was performed on 30 adult male Syrian golden hamsters allocated {{to one of three}} groups: control group which received no opiate; the first study group received oral opiate; and another study group received inhaled opiate. After 4 weeks, all hamsters were anesthetized with diethyl ether and their blood samples were obtained from their hearts for laboratory assessment. Results: The blood level of hs-CRP was significantly higher in group used opium orally compared with the group used opium orally (P < 0. 001); other markers were not different between the two experiments groups. The level of hs-CRP was higher in the two study groups than the controls. Blood hemocysteine levels following oral and inhaled opium use were comparable with the controls.
