5000|$|The band {{is known}} for {{renunciation}} of titling their works; all of their songs bear the name of [...] "Dark" [...] and are only differentiated by a two additional numbers, being the album number and overall song number, respectively. Additionally, all of their albums are titled [...] "Dark Space", differentiated only by a number indicating order of release. For example, Dark 1.6 is the sixth overall song from their first album, <b>Dark</b> <b>Space</b> 1. Counter-intuitively, their 4th album is not called <b>Dark</b> <b>Space</b> IV, but <b>Dark</b> <b>Space</b> III I.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the perception of}} orthodontists and laypersons regarding {{the size of the}} <b>dark</b> <b>spaces</b> in the buccal corridors and how that affects smile esthetics in individuals with long and short faces. Materials and Methods: Images of eight smiling individuals were modified to create five sizes of <b>dark</b> <b>spaces</b> in the buccal corridors (2 %, 10 %, 15 %, 22 %, and 28 %) and were submitted to a group of laypersons and a group of orthodontists. Results: Laypersons were more critical in their evaluation than orthodontists. Laypersons could not distinguish the gradation of <b>dark</b> <b>spaces</b> in the buccal corridor unless it was very plain. Orthodontists perceived this gradation beginning at 15 %. Female evaluators were more critical than male evaluators in both groups. Conclusions: The presence or absence of <b>dark</b> <b>spaces</b> in the buccal corridors has little influence over smile esthetics. While this aspect must be considered in the orthodontic diagnosis, there is no justification for expanding the buccal corridor to eliminate <b>dark</b> <b>spaces</b> unless they are very evident.

40|$|Six radial targets having {{different}} {{line width}} to space width ratios were made.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a low pressure {{reactive ion etching}} process capable of patterning nanometer scale angled sidewalls and three dimensional structures in photoresist. At low pressure the plasma has a large <b>dark</b> <b>space</b> region where the etchant ions have very large highly-directional mean free paths. Mounting the sample entirely within this <b>dark</b> <b>space</b> allows for etching at angles relative to the cathode with minimal undercutting, resulting in high-aspect ratio nanometer scale angled features. By reversing the initial angle and performing a second etch we create three-dimensional mask profiles...|$|R

Nitrogen {{presents}} a very remarkable discharge, between two balls {{of the respective}} diameters of 0.15 and 2 inches (1506. 1518.), the smaller one being rendered negative either directly inducteously. The peculiar discharge occurs at intervals between 0.42 and 0.68, and even at 1.4 inches when the large ball was inductric positively; it consisted of a little brushy part on the small negative ball, then a <b>dark</b> <b>space,</b> and lastly a dull straight line on the large positive ball (fig. 134.). The position of the <b>dark</b> <b>space</b> was very constant, and is probably in direct relation to the <b>dark</b> <b>space</b> described when negative glow was produced (1544.). When by any circumstance a bright spark was determined, the contrast with the peculiar spark described was very striking; for it always had a faint purple part, but the place of this part was constantly near the positive ball.|$|R

As the air is pumped out of the tube, a variety of different discharge phenomena can be seen, including the Crookes and Faraday <b>dark</b> <b>spaces,</b> which are shown in Figure 1. As the pressure is decreased by pumping on the tube, a glow discharge begins at the negative end of the tube, then encompasses the entire tube, as the mean free path of the electrons in the low-pressure air becomes longer.

5000|$|By the 1870s, British {{physicist}} William Crookes {{and others}} were able to evacuate tubes to a lower pressure, below 10−6 atm. These were called Crookes tubes.

This came to be called the [...] "cathode dark space", [...] "Faraday dark space" [...] or [...] "Crookes dark space". Crookes found that as he pumped more air out of the tubes, the Faraday <b>dark</b> <b>space</b> spread down the tube from the cathode toward the anode, until the tube was totally dark. But at the anode (positive) end of the tube, the glass of the tube itself began to glow.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{atmospheric}} pressure glow discharge in air is gen-erated between {{the surface of}} a water electrode and a metal elec-trode with a high alternating current (60 Hz) voltage (20 kV). The gap distance between the two electrodes can be adjusted from 3 mm to a few centimeters. The diameter of the plasma column is in the 3 – 10 mm range. Photographs taken with a high-speed charge coupled device camera clearly show a cathode fall region, negative glow, positive column, and <b>anode</b> <b>dark</b> space; a structure consis-tent with that of a normal glow discharge. The initial breakdown process shows that the plasma ignites at the water surface and ter-minates at the metal electrode. TheN 2 rotational and vibrational temperatures were spectroscopically measured to be about 1800 and 2600 K, respectively...|$|R
