25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|James did {{not play}} at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England. He became {{the leader of the}} team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, {{stepping}} back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history. He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.

500|$|Senior Amaker {{served as}} team captain for the 1986–87 Blue Devils, and he led Duke {{back to the}} 1987 NCAA tournament, where they {{advanced}} to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to eventual champion Indiana. The key players on the team that year were Amaker and sophomore Danny Ferry. During his senior season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association instituted the three-point field goal. Amaker led Duke in three point shooting that year. He hit a three-point shot with 1:39 remaining in overtime against 17–0 (4–0 ACC) Horace Grant-led Clemson to give Duke the lead for good. A few weeks later, with the score tied in regulation at 60 against [...] and on a two-on-one fast break with 16 seconds left, Amaker took a jump shot. Krzyzewski said Duke lost the game {{because it did not}} play <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> its opponent and Markus described this example in his column. In Amaker's final home game, he made a jump shot with 1:15 remaining that put number seventeen Duke, which made all six of its free throws in the final 45 seconds, ahead for good in its rematch against number thirteen Clemson.

500|$|... "Improbable" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B+". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called the script [...] "very witty". The two wrote that [...] "the brilliance of Chris Carter's direction" [...] allowed the viewer of the episode to see it [...] "from God's point of view". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "is not <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> it thinks it is. But it's still pretty smart." [...] John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review {{and gave it a}} 6 out of 10 rating. He wrote that [...] "overall, this episode was amusing enough, but there was nothing about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired [...] "lite" [...] episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it's a shame to see them do it again." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "bizarre yet amusing" [...] and said that the central numerology story [...] "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also {{praised the}} {{direction}} of the King's Landing story, and Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei, saying in his review [...] "Ms. Headey's performance was but one element in a sequence that, technically, ranks among the show's best. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week's battle-heavy episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday's installment. Cersei's scheme unspooled amid insistent strings and a series of shots — those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling candle-fuse, Margaery's growing concern and rising tension in the Sept — that built inexorably to the High Sparrow's realization that he wasn't <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> he thought." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly stated he felt the episode introduced new conflicts to look forward to in the next season, saying [...] "Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7." [...] Sarah Larson of The New Yorker wrote in her review, [...] "It's a beautiful image. Boats, clouds, sun, dragons, and two female ship captains, pointing their armada toward a Westeros ruled by a queen." [...] James Hunt of WhatCulture wrote in his review, [...] "What a way to go out. Season 6 has already proved to be a great season of TV, but it saved its best for last." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode, [...] "the best episode ever." [...] Brian Lowry of CNN wrote in his review for the episode, [...] "At this point it's hard to second-guess producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who, working with Martin, have created a series for the ages." [...] Willa Paskin of Slate wrote in his review, [...] "Revenge, a dish Game of Thrones has almost always made taste awful, served hot or cold, became, in the finale, a delicacy. [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{giving it}} four stars and naming {{it the best}} film of the year, wrote: [...] "David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> its {{brilliant}} hero, {{but in the same}} way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film his first full four star rating of the year and said: [...] "The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade." [...] The Harvard Crimson review called it [...] "flawless" [...] and gave it five stars. Quentin Tarantino listed The Social Network as one of his favorite 20 movies of the year, second to Toy Story 3.|$|E

2500|$|The Master and the Doctor {{are shown}} to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates on Gallifrey, where the Master {{outperformed}} the Doctor.

In the 2007 episode [...] "Utopia", the Tenth Doctor calls the transformed and disguised Master a genius and shows admiration for his intellect before discovering his true identity. The Tenth Doctor further expresses admiration for the Master's intellect in The End of Time by calling him [...] "stone cold brilliant" [...] and yet states that the Master could be more if he would just give up his desire for domination. The Twelfth Doctor states that Missy is [...] "the one person almost <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> me" [...] ("The Lie of the Land").|$|E
2500|$|New York Post critic Lou Lumenick {{stated that}} [...] "Hollywood {{provides}} the Islamic world {{another reason to}} hate America with The Kingdom," [...] calling it [...] "xenophobic" [...] and [...] "pandering." [...] The A.V.

He says the film appeals to the audience's [...] "basest instincts" [...] and that, despite one sympathetic Arab character, the film could be tarred as racist.

2500|$|The Americans went an undefeated 8–0 and {{averaged}} 116 points per game, winning {{by an average}} margin of 32.1 points—the fifth highest in US Olympic history. Team USA trailed {{in the fourth quarter}} only once, against Lithuania in the opening round. James became the leader of the team with Bryant—who would turn 34 in August 2012—stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. After winning the gold, Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski said James [...] "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> anybody playing the game right now". Durant scored a United States Olympics record of 156 points in the tournament. He also made 34 three-point field goals, breaking the previous United States mark of 17; Anthony (23) also exceed the old record. Bryant was not in peak condition early, but he played himself into shape and was a key contributor in the final three games. While Chandler was the team's only true center—Davis was thin and had no professional experience—Krzyzewski also played Love, James or Anthony as Team USA's de facto center.
