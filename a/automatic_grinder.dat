40|$|Physical {{dormancy}} of Robinia pseudoacacia seeds {{makes it}} a challenge for scientists and forest managers to obtain a homogeneous germination for larger seed samples. Water imbibition of the seeds can be achieved through manual piercing of the seed coat, but this method remains time consuming and heterogeneous. We tested several ecologically friendly methods to break seed dormancy, including manual pin puncture, water soaking, oven dry-heating (two temperatures) and sanding. Sanding was performed using an <b>automatic</b> <b>grinder</b> to control shaking duration (three durations) and get a homogeneous scraping of the coat. All methods, except dry-heating, resulted in successful dormancy breaking; water soaking was the least efficient method, attaining 57 % germination. Sanding proved to be as efficient as puncturing (97 %) but long duration sanding (10 or 15 min) could damage cotyledons, which would impede further development of the plant. Short-time sanding (5 min) {{proved to be the}} best method to reach high total germination and healthy (undamaged cotyledon) seedlings, and was successfully applied to 500 seeds. The reference puncture method and the automatic sanding were also tested on seeds of nine Fabaceae species and proved to be efficient for some species. Automated sanding can thus be used as a standard to break physical dormancy of black locust or other Fabaceae seeds to allow further comparative studies of plant populations or genotypes...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} results of inverted pyramids passivated emitter and rear cells (IP-PERC) of varying thickness down to 63 /spl mu/m on FZ and Cz material are presented. The rear side contacts are made conventionally {{as well as}} by the laser-fired contacts (LFC) method. The V/sub oc/ dependence on cell thickness of annealed and degraded Cz is measured. The investigated relationships can be modeled well by PC 1 D. Thus it is possible to predict the cell performance depending on thickness and bulk diffusion length. The wafers were thinned down from 250 /spl mu/m with new equipment (fully <b>automatic</b> infeed <b>grinder)</b> at Fraunhofer ISE labs...|$|R
500|$|In 1920 Charles Churchill & Co {{participated in}} a machine tool {{exhibition}} at the Olympia exhibition centre in London between 4 and 25 September involving many manufacturers and agents. A tabulated list published at the time showed the company's stationary exhibits comprised machines for boring and drilling, centring, planing, shaping, drop forging and gear hobbing, as well as upright, radial and sensitive drills, furnaces, centre and precision lathes, [...] "tool/cutter grinders" [...] and twist-drill machinery. In addition, it exhibited running examples of boring and turning mills, machines for broaching, gear cutting, thread milling, horizontal plain milling, universal milling and vertical milling, along with internal, surface and [...] "cylinder/plain/universal" [...] <b>grinders,</b> <b>automatic</b> and [...] "capstan/turret" [...] lathes. There are many notices before and subsequent to this of the company's participation in exhibitions reported in American Machinist.|$|R
