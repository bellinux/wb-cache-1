40|$|Standardized {{catch rates}} of the {{sailfish}} (Istiophorus albicans) were obtained from 10615 trip observations of surface longline fishing targeting swordfish during the period 2001 - 2014. In roughly 28 % of these trips at least one individual belonging to this species was found. Because of the low prevalence of this species in this fishery, the standardized CPUE was developed using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model assuming a delta-lognormal error distribution. The results obtained indicate that the overall trend of the standardized CPUE was similar for the total <b>Atlantic</b> <b>areas</b> and for the East and West stocks.

In particular, he supervised the post construction and post overhaul pre-deployment training, Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO) and tactical load out periods for the Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines in an exemplary manner. By virtue of dynamic leadership and outstanding professional knowledge, he ensured the successful operation of two SSBN replenishment sites and the effective functioning of off crew support operations at Charleston, South Carolina. Rear Admiral Loughlin further {{has proven to be a}} most articulate and impressive spokesman for the Navy. In carrying out all of the foregoing duties, as well as the additional NATO duty of Commander Submarine Force, Eastern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Area</b> (Designate), Rear Admiral Loughlin has demonstrated the finest degree of judgment and an inspiring devotion to duty which has been fully in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so.
