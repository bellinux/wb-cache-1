Such a component is constrained by the Lyman alpha forest observations, can account for the small-scale power required by spectroscopic gravitational lensing, and yields a source of early star formation that can reionise the universe at z~ 20 yet becomes an inefficient source of ionizing photons by z~ 10, thereby allowing the conventional adiabatic fluctuation component to reproduce the late thermal history of the intergalactic medium.

40|$|Abstract — Digital signal {{processing}} (DSP) {{is used to}} perform filtering, decimation and down conversion in common communications systems, like in oversampling analog to digital converters in wireless and audio applications. This paper describes a design of low order FIR (finite impulse response) filters to be used at the high sampling rates for achieving a low power DSP implementation. This paper reviews the asymptotic zero energy dissipation techniques named as Adiabatic switching logic. The Adiabatic switching technique beats the dynamic power as well as short circuit power, using recycling of energy stored on circuit capacitances instead of dissipating it as heat. PAL technique is the simplest fully adiabatic technique requiring lesser number of power clocks as well as area. Design of four tap 8 -bit fully pipelined FIR filter, using PAL adiabatic technique and CMOS technique is compared at different operating frequencies from 5 MHz to 100 MHz, the range which includes input sampling rate for GSM (10 MS/s) and DECT (50 MS/s) standards.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a novel high speed low power 15 - 4 Compressor for high speed multiplication applications using single phase clocked quasi static adiabatic logic namely CEPAL (Complementary Energy Path Adiabatic Logic). The main advantage of this static adiabatic logic is the minimization of the 1 / 2 CVth 2 energy dissipation occurring every cycle in the multi-phase power-clocked adiabatic circuits. The proposed Compressor uses bit sliced architecture to exploit the parallelism in the computation of sum of 15 input bits by five full adders. The newly proposed Compressor is also centered around the design of a novel 5 - 3 Compressor that attempts to minimize the stage delays of a conventional 5 - 3 Compressor that is designed using single bit full adder and half adder architectures. Firstly, the performance characteristics of CEPAL 15 - 3 Compressor with 14 transistor and 10 transistor adder designs are compared against the conventional static CMOS logic counterpart to identify its <b>adiabatic</b> <b>power</b> advantage. The analyses are carried out using the industry standard Tanner EDA design environment using 250 nm technology libraries.

40|$|Deviations of the interplanetary {{magnetic}} field (IMF) from Parker’s model are frequently {{observed in the}} heliosphere at different distances r from the Sun. Usually, it is supposed that the IMF behavior corresponds to Parker’s model overall, {{but there is some}} turbulent component that impacts and disrupts the full picture of the IMF spatial and temporal distribution. However, the analysis of multi-spacecraft in-ecliptic IMF measurements from 0. 29 AU to 5 AU shows that the IMF radial evolution is rather far from expected. The radial IMF component decreases with the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>power</b> index (|Br | ∝ r− 5 / 3), the tangential component |Br | ∝ r− 1, and the IMF strength B ∝ r− 1. 4. This means that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind. It is possible that turbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly influence the IMF expansion. This is confirmed by the analysis of the Br distribution’s radial evolution. Br has a well-known bimodal histogram only at 0. 7 – 2. 0 AU. The bimodality effect gradually disappears from 1 AU to 4 AU, and Br becomes quasi-normally distributed at 3 – 4 AU (which is a sign of rapid vanishing of the stable sector structure with heliocentric distance). We consider a quasi-continuous magnetic reconnection, occurring both at the heliospheric current sheet and at local current sheets inside the IMF sectors, to be a key process responsible for the solar wind turbulization with heliocentric distance {{as well as for the}} breakdown of the “frozen-in IMF ” law.

40|$|We perform <b>adiabatic</b> regularization of <b>power</b> {{spectrum}} in nonminimally coupled general single-field inflation {{with varying}} speed of sound.

As in the result for the canonical inflation, the regularized power spectrum tends to the "bare" power spectrum as the Universe expands during (and even after) inflation.

40|$|If the {{hemispherical}} power asymmetry {{observed in}} {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) on large angular scales is attributable to a superhorizon curvaton fluctuation, then the simplest model predicts that the primordial density fluctuations should be similarly asymmetric on all smaller scales. The distribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power asymmetry on scales k ~ 1. 5 h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the asymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the asymmetry in the CMB. We show that {{it is not possible to}} generate an asymmetry with this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the inflaton and curvaton to the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>power</b> spectrum. Instead, we consider curvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out, thus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon fluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these perturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on large angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate the observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the curvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero. The model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from fluctuations in the inflaton field. Future observations and analyses of the CMB will test this model because the power asymmetry generated by this model has a specific spectrum, and the model requires that the current upper bounds on isocurvature power are nearly saturated.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in compact, practical adiabatic comput-ing circuits which demonstrate signicant energy savings have {{renewed interest in}} using such techniques in low-power systems. Several recently introduced circuits for adiabatic computing make use of diodes {{in a way which}} reduces switching energy from O(CV dd 2) in the non-adiabatic (ie: standard CMOS) case, to O(CV ddV t). These circuits provide an energy savings of at most one order of V dd=V t. This paper introduces a new class of adiabatic computing circuits which oer several advan-tages over existing approaches, the primary one being that, because no diodes are used, switching energy can be reduced to an energy oor of O(CV t 2). These sec-ond order adiabatic computing circuits provide an ener-gy savings of as much as O(V dd=V t 2) over conventional CMOS. Additional advantages of the proposed circuits include the fact that, in comparison to most compact adiabatic circuits which have oating output levels over the entire data valid time, these new circuits have non-oating output levels over most of the data valid time. This is important for restoring logic levels and minimiz-ing problems with crosstalk.

40|$|Given the {{proliferation}} of bouncing models in recent years, we gather and critically assess these proposals in a comprehensive review. The Planck data shows an unmistakably red, quasi scale-invariant, purely <b>adiabatic</b> primordial <b>power</b> spectrum and no primary non-Gaussianities. While these observations are consistent with inflationary predictions, bouncing cosmologies aspire to provide an alternative framework to explain them. Such models face many problems, both of the purely theoretical kind, such as the necessity of violating the NEC and instabilities, and at the cosmological application level, as exemplified by the possible presence of shear. We provide a pedagogical introduction to these problems and also assess the fitness of different proposals {{with respect to the}} data. For example, many models predict a slightly blue spectrum and must be fine-tuned to generate a red spectral index; as a side effect, large non-Gaussianities often result. We highlight several promising attempts to violate the NEC without introducing dangerous instabilities at the classical and/or quantum level. If primordial gravitational waves are observed, certain bouncing cosmologies, such as the cyclic scenario, are in trouble, while others remain valid. We conclude that, while most bouncing cosmologies are far from providing an alternative to the inflationary paradigm, a handful of interesting proposals have surfaced, which warrant further research.
