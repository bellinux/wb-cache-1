The risk of {{developing}} breast cancer and the risk of missing cancer at screening rise with higher breast density. In this paper, the historical background to breast density measurement is outlined and current evidence based practice is explained. The relevance of breast density knowledge to mammographic practice and image interpretation is considered in the light of clinical <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> of mammographic breast density (MBD). The current work also discusses risk stratification for decision-making regarding screening frequency and better modalities for earlier detection of breast cancer in the dense breast. Automated volumetric approaches are explained while ultrasound, digital breast tomosynthesis, molecular breast imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging are introduced as valuable adjuncts to digital mammography for imaging the dense breast. The work concludes on the important note that screened women should be notified of their breast density, and such notification should be accompanied with clear and adequate information about breast density and cancer risk, strategies associated with lower MBD, as well as best screening intervals and pathways for women with dense breasts. Adoption of these strategies may be crucial to early detection and treatment of cancer and improving survival from the disease...|$|E

Conceptually, this system acts as an automated mapping from spacecraft state to high-level operator response. It is being developed as a means to reduce the cost of space missions by drastically reducing the operator hours and communication bandwidth committed to nominal health monitoring. Validation of this system is being performed experimentally on the Stanford AudioPhonic PHotographic InfraRed Experiment (SAPPHIRE) microsatellite as operated through a real-world space operations system under development at Stanford University. This system includes a number of university-built microsatellites and groundstations. System level performance metrics will include cost of nominal monitoring, timeliness of anomaly notification, and quality of the health assessment. This paper reviews the overall design of the health assessment system, detailing the unique aspects of the SAPPHIRE flight software and the Beacon Automated Contingency-in-Orbit Notification (BACON) receiving station.

RESULTS: 151 patients (aged 71 ± 15  years) travelled to hospital via ambulance and were eligible for this analysis. Time of symptom onset was recorded in 61 (40 %) cases, the FAST test was positive in 114 (75 %) and a prealert message was sent in 65 (44 %). Following adjustment for confounding, patients who had time of onset recorded (HR 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 52 to 1. 03), were FAST-positive (HR 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 37 to 0. 80) or were prealerted (HR 0. 26, 95 % CI 0. 18 to 0. 38), were more likely to receive a timely CT request in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of hospital prealerting, accurate stroke recognition, and recording of onset time.

40|$|Abstract Background Family {{history is}} a common risk factor for {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC), yet it is often underused to guide risk assessment {{and the provision of}} risk-appropriate CRC screening recommendation. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify from a patient perspective health care providers' current practice relating to: (i) assessment of family history of CRC; (ii) notification of "increased risk" to patients at "moderately/potentially high" familial risk; and (iii) recommendation that patients undertake CRC screening. Methods 1592 persons aged 56 - 88 years randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study (HCS), New South Wales, Australia were mailed a questionnaire. 1117 participants (70 %) returned a questionnaire. Results Thirty eight percent of respondents reported ever being asked about their family history of CRC. Ever discussing family history of CRC with a health care provider was significantly more likely to occur for persons with a higher level of education, who had ever received screening advice and with a lower physical component summary score. Fifty one percent of persons at "moderately/potentially high risk" were notified of their "increased risk" of developing CRC. Thirty one percent of persons across each level of risk had ever received CRC screening advice from a health care provider. Screening advice provision was significantly more likely to occur for persons who had ever discussed their family history of CRC with a health care provider and who were at "moderately/potentially high risk". Conclusions Effective interventions that integrate both the <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> of familial risk of CRC to the wider population are needed. Systematic and cost-effective mechanisms that facilitate family history collection, risk assessment and provision of screening advice within the primary health care setting are required. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Automated Space System Experimental Testbed (ASSET) {{system is}} a simple yet {{comprehensive}} real-world operations network being developed. Phase 3 of the ASSET Project was January-December 1997 and {{is the subject of}} this report. This phase permitted SSDL and its project partners to expand the ASSET system in a variety of ways. These added capabilities included the advancement of ground station capabilities, the adaptation of spacecraft on-board software, and the expansion of capabilities of the ASSET management algorithms. Specific goals of Phase 3 were: (1) Extend Web-based goal-level commanding for both the payload PI and the spacecraft engineer. (2) Support prioritized handling of multiple (PIs) Principle Investigators as well as associated payload experimenters. (3) Expand the number and types of experiments supported by the ASSET system and its associated spacecraft. (4) Implement more advanced resource management, modeling and fault management capabilities that integrate the space and ground segments of the space system hardware. (5) Implement a beacon monitoring test. (6) Implement an experimental blackboard controller for space system management. (7) Further define typical ground station developments required for Internet-based remote control and for full system automation of the PI-to-spacecraft link. Each of those goals are examined.

40|$|Background: The use of {{emergency}} services with prehospital stroke <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> early <b>notification</b> {{to the treatment}} hospital (stroke code) is a crucial determinant of delay time for acute stroke treatment. We reviewed and summarized the literature on prehospital stroke code system implementation. Methods: Two databases were explored (last update June 20, 2011) with 3 key words (stroke code, stroke prehospital management and stroke prehospital services). Inclusion criteria were: randomized and quasirandomized controlled trials, cohort and case-control studies, and hospital-and emergency-based registers, with no year or language restrictions. We examined the reference lists of all included articles. All potentially relevant reports and abstracts were transcribed into a specifically designed data abstraction form. Results: Only 19 of the 680 studies which were initially retrieved, published from 1999 to 2011, fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One clinical trial was identified. Large differences in stroke code procedures and study designs within and across countries prohibited the pooling of the data. Most {{studies were carried out}} in urban areas. Assuming the rate of tissue-plasminogen activator treatment as the performance measure, most studies report {{a significant increase in the}} rate of treatment (increase between 3. 2 and 16 %) with only 1 study not reporting any increase. Conclusions: Despite its limitations, this review suggests that the use of prehospital stroke code is an important intervention to improve the accessibility of the benefits of thrombolysis, especially when implemented together with educational campaigns to optimize the awareness and behavior of patients and bystanders.

50|$|Scientific {{evidence}} to support the effectiveness of sex offender registration policies in the United States is limited and mixed. Sex offender registration <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> (SORN) laws are highly accepted by the public, who believe that knowing the location of sex offenders residence may improve their ability to guard themselves and their children from sexual victimization. Empirical observations do not typically support this assumption, however. According to the Office of Justice Programs' SMART Office, sex offender registration <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> requirements arguably have been implemented in the absence of empirical evidence regarding their effectiveness. Majority of research results do not find statistically significant shift in sexual offense trends following the implementation of sex offender registration <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> (SORN) regimes. A few studies indicate that sexual recidivism may have been lowered by SORN policies, while a few have found statistically significant increase in sex crimes following SORN implementation. According to Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, the states (e.g. Minnesota, Washington) where community notification has indicated of having some effectiveness employ empirically derived sex offender risk <b>assessment</b> procedures <b>and</b> apply public <b>notification</b> only on high risk offenders. Some policies — especially residency restrictions <b>and</b> community <b>notification</b> — may adversely impact on public safety due to the obstacles they create to successful reintegration of an offender.|$|R
