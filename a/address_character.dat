40|$|One issue {{dealing with}} science is its {{dichotomy}} or disunity. It {{is assumed that}} there is some basic opposition between science and religion, that scientific truth contradicts religion on some points, and that one must choose between being a religious person, a believer in God, or a scientist, a follower of reason. The concept of unity of sciences sees sciences as one unit. This concept confirms that all sciences are from God. As the result, there must be a kind of dialogue between sciences and religious values. Learning sciences will make the learners know more about and closer to God. This study was aimed at identifying (1) characters addressed in EFL class, (2) the practices to <b>address</b> <b>character</b> education in EFL class through unity of science concept It was designed qualitatively using questionnaire, Focus Group Discussion, and observation for collecting data.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{teaching}} Chinese as a foreign language (TCFL), many beginning learners were attracted by the unique Chinese writing system, but meanwhile, they also experienced considerable frustrations in production of learned characters. The literature has focused on character recognition, and suggested ways to improve recognition. But so far, there have been very few studies concerned production of characters. Furthermore, although learners 2 ̆ 7 needs and concerns were undoubtedly felt, limited by classroom resources, Chinese teachers normally could do very few to <b>address</b> <b>character</b> production problems during teaching sessions. Thus, learners typically had to struggle lonely {{through the process of}} character production. Fortunately, with more and more sophisticated computer-based multimedia instructional materials becoming available in the field, learners of today have access to various out-of-classroom resources on character memorization and production that were unavailable to many earlier learners. Studies on the effects of these electronic materials on learners 2 ̆ 7 character production, however, remain scarce. ^ This study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} voiced-pronunciation and stroke sequence animation, two frequently selected inputs in Chinese multimedia flashcards, on production of characters by beginners of Chinese as a foreign language. One hundred students, enrolled in an elementary Chinese course at a large Mid-western university, participated. Students were divided into four treatment groups. Four different formats of computer-based multimedia flashcards of the same vocabulary list were developed for this study. Each group was required to memorize and produce afterwards the characters on the assigned flashcards. The instrument was administered as one pretest and two post-tests to examine the individual and interaction effects of the two concerned media inputs. ^ Findings of this study were that the group that viewed characters displayed with both voice and animation (WVWA) performed significantly worse, while the group with voice only (WVNA) scored much better than the rest of the experimental groups. Explanations and discussions were provided from the perspective of dual-coding theory (Paivio, 1986; Clark 2 ̆ 6 Paivio, 1991). Further investigations on the effect of stroke sequence animation are needed to determine, for example, whether this medium can assist learners 2 ̆ 7 mastery of proper stroke sequences. ...|$|E

Methods comparative and dynamic analysis classification and typology description and measurements including using the tools of institutional Economics the data were interpreted using tables. 	Results it is shown that {{due to the lack of}} financial resources the government has to make unpopular decisions that reduce the level of social support of the population for the near future. The adopted laws stipulating the principles of <b>address</b> <b>character</b> and needs when providing regional measures of social support increase the risks of poverty and inequality. The analysis has been made of the ranking position of Russia and member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in terms of GDP per capita human development index and quality of life index. The article grounds the need for institutional change to facilitate transition to progressive taxation and redistribution of the tax burden from the poor and middle classes to the super rich. The flat personal income tax rate has not led to the desired results of growing tax revenues in the budget. Russia is still among the top ten states with the largest tax evasion losses. The weak redistributive mechanisms including a flat scale of personal income tax regressive social security contributions and low property taxes lead to stagnation inequality underfunding of education and health. 	Scientific novelty the article proves the conclusion about need of institutional transformations associated with changing the current tax policy priorities. The transition to a progressive scale of income and wealth taxation promotes the transfer of tax burden from the middle and poor to the rich. 	These measures can provide a double economic effect. On the one hand the principle of effective taxation quotgo where there is moneyquot the validity of which must be supported by deoffshorization measures on the other ndash the transition to progressive taxation increases the level of social justice and provides a positive economic outcome due to the growth of trust and social capital.
