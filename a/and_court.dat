5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens <b>and</b> <b>court</b> cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's <b>and</b> <b>court</b> cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E

5|$|Heian culture <b>and</b> <b>court</b> life {{reached a}} peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts <b>and</b> <b>court</b> service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
