50|$|Goggles (<b>eye</b> <b>protection)</b> {{should be}} worn to avoid eye damage. In one 2004 study, tanners said they avoided goggles to prevent leaving pale skin around the eyes.

40|$|Background/purpose: We tested <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> {{used for}} {{phototherapy}} patients. The study also established current practice concerning <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> {{in a sample}} of UK phototherapy units. Methods: The ultraviolet (UV) transmission spectra of 30 ‘UV protective’ contact lenses were measured at 5 nm intervals between 290 and 400 nm. Sunglasses, small UV goggles and UV visors were tested between 270 and 420 nm. We surveyed the use of <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> during phototherapy in 78 UK phototherapy units. Results: All samples of sunglasses, <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> goggles, visors and sunglasses comfortably passed previously published arbitrary limits of acceptability. Most contact lenses showed some protection in the UVB, but most had little or no UVA protection. Of 78 UK phototherapy units 21 (33...|$|R

Measures of <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> use and of eye safety {{knowledge}} and beliefs {{are based on a}} survey of 300 Latino farmworkers in North Carolina. Few farmworkers report using <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> (8. 3 %); most (92. 3 %) report that employers do not provide <b>eye</b> <b>protection.</b> Approximately 70 % report that they are not trained in preventing eye injuries; 81 % believe that their chances of getting an eye injury are low. Many farmworkers choose to take risks in order to save time. Interventions are needed that target farmworker knowledge and beliefs about eye safety. 2011 - 04 - 06 T 00 : 00 : 00 ZPMC 307159...|$|R

Depending on the range, prescription eyeglasses may qualify as <b>eye</b> <b>protection.</b> Indoor ranges can be particularly unsafe, due to high lead exposures and increased noise exposures where the design or management is not of a quality conducive to best practice.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of face alignment affects {{the performance of}} a face recognition system. Since face alignment is usually conducted using eye positions, an accurate eye localization algorithm is therefore essential for accurate face recognition. In this paper, we first study the impact of eye locations on face recognition accuracy, and then introduce an <b>automatic</b> technique for <b>eye</b> detection. The performance of our <b>automatic</b> <b>eye</b> detection technique is subsequently validated using FRGC 1. 0 database. The validation shows that our eye detector has an overall 94. 5 % eye detection rate, with the detected eyes very close to the manually provided eye positions. In addition, the face recognition performance based on the <b>automatic</b> <b>eye</b> detection is shown to be comparable to that of using manually given eye positions. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on a sample of 1552 firefighting personnel to determine the incidence of eye injuries within the United Kingdom fire service. In total, 3. 5 % (n = 22 / 637) of firefighters per year will sustain an eye injury requiring 'medical attention'. This represents one ocular injury per 50, 000 working hours. In 80 % of cases <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> was not being worn {{at the time of}} injury. Analysis of 75 accident report forms indicates that the vast majority (69 / 75) of eye injuries were sustained whilst on operational duty. These statistics are comparable to other professions which are considered to have an unacceptably high risk of injury and in which <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> has therefore been actively enforced. It would follow that similar steps should be taken within the fire service to ensure firefighters wear <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> on operational duty. This should apply even if there is no immediate recognition of a perceived danger. A firefighter presenting to an optometrist or medical practitioner, with or without an eye injury, should be counselled as to the advantages of <b>eye</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|R
