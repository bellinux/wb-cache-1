40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{self-study}} of developing an integrated play-based pedagogy in a preservice early childhood teacher education subject <b>about</b> <b>play.</b> It is framed by understandings {{of play in}} children’s lives and adult learning. The self-study was initially driven by a contradiction between teaching preservice teachers <b>about</b> <b>play</b> through didactic means and learning <b>about</b> <b>play</b> through play. Other tensions subsequently arose in this self-study and required me to reframe my thoughts and actions so I could move forward. This paper documents the tensions and reframings as the self-study proceeded {{over the course of}} a semester. It reveals that developing an integrated play-based pedagogy not only involves play-based activities per se but also the atmosphere in which experiences and interactions unfold and the play qualities they embody. Ideally, students become major players in the process of the development of pedagogy...|$|R

Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E

Willie McKay commented that Brown was excited <b>about</b> <b>playing</b> for such a successful club and the chance to play in the UEFA Champions League. Brown was transferred for £4.4 million, the largest transfer fee exchanged between two Scottish clubs. The previous record was the £4 million transfer of Duncan Ferguson from Dundee United to Rangers. Brown scored in his final appearance for Hibs, against Celtic, for whom he had agreed to sign the previous week. During the game he was cheered by both sets of supporters.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind <b>about</b> <b>playing</b> all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E

While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures.

5|$|In early 1942, Bence filmed El tercer beso, {{directed}} by Luis César Amadori and co-starring Pedro López Lagar and Silvia Legrand. Though Bence was concerned <b>about</b> <b>playing</b> {{the mother of}} Legrand, who was only 13 years younger than she was, the film was a success and she won her the Silver Condor Award for Best Actress from the Argentine Film Critics Association for the performance. The recognition led to her appearance frequently {{on the covers of}} magazines, and to an offer to appear in what would {{become one of the most}} important films in the history of Argentine cinema, La guerra gaucha. The film starred Bence and Sebastián Chiola, Ángel Magaña, Enrique Muiño, and Francisco Petrone and is set at the turn of the nineteenth century in northern Argentina. It was shot on location in Salta Province and was based on the novel of the same name by writer Leopoldo Lugones. Scriptwriters Hómero Manzi and Ulises Petit de Murat, wove the disparate stories of the characters into an overview of the gauchos' revolt against Spanish rule. The film, unlike Hollywood Westerns, neither portrayed colonization as progress, nor focused the action on the indigenous people, instead focusing on the patriotic pride of the gauchos. The film won seven awards and Bence won an award as best actress of the year from the City of Buenos Aires. It also earned her an offer from Paramount Pictures to come to the US and work in Hollywood, but she declined the offer.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study was designed}} to explore the constructions of Early Childhood Educators’ (ECE) beliefs <b>about</b> <b>play</b> and how they translate these beliefs into practice. Guided by a teachers’ beliefs framework (Sanger & Osguthorpe, 2011; Haney & McArthur, 2001; Richards & Lockheart, 1994; Pajares, 1992) and a constructivist philosophical lens, the study sought to identify (a) ECE educators’ beliefs <b>about</b> <b>play,</b> (b) how the educators practice play, and (c) how they incorporate both theoretical and practical components of play beliefs into the early childhood education classroom. A postmodern orientation and rigorous qualitative research methods were employed. Data were collected in three phases: an in-depth open-ended interview was conducted, followed by classroom observation over the course of 6 weeks, and finally a second interview was conducted using the process of Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR) with four purposefully selected participants. The interview data were transcribed and categories were co-constructed with the participants. Findings revealed that the educators came into their training programs with certain core beliefs <b>about</b> <b>play</b> that were developed in pre-service experience (upbringing, culture, childhood memories). These core beliefs {{played an important role in}} the information that these educators were able to filter into their previous beliefs <b>about</b> <b>play.</b> Further, the educators’ beliefs <b>about</b> <b>play</b> appeared to be reinforced and even magnified through their training programs, as they were able to take specific techniques and approaches and apply them in their practice. Two of the educators had previous experience working in daycare, hence facilitating the application of new knowledge to their pre-existing beliefs. The study findings add to a small growing body of research that furthers our understanding of the construction of early childhood educator beliefs. This research also helps us understand how educators’ pre-service and in-service experience contributes to the development of play beliefs and helps in the transfer of beliefs into practice. In addition, the findings give a voice to the early childhood educators, making a valuable contribution to the literature...|$|R

25|$|In 1834, virtuoso violinist and {{composer}} Niccolò Paganini commissioned Berlioz {{to compose a}} viola concerto, intending to premiere it as soloist. This became the symphony for viola and orchestra, Harold en Italie. Paganini changed his mind <b>about</b> <b>playing</b> the piece himself {{when he saw the}} first sketches for the work; he expressed misgivings over its outward lack of complexity. The premiere of the piece was held later that year. After initially rejecting the piece, Paganini, as Berlioz's Mémoires recount, knelt before Berlioz in front of the orchestra after hearing {{it for the first time}} and proclaimed him a genius and heir to Beethoven. The next day he sent Berlioz a gift of 20,000 francs, the generosity of which left Berlioz uncharacteristically lost for words. Around this time, Berlioz decided to conduct most of his own concerts, tired as he was of conductors who did not understand his music. This decision launched what was to become a lucrative and creatively fruitful career in conducting music both by himself and by other leading composers.|$|E
25|$|The {{participating}} {{teams were}} not immediately selected, {{and a number}} of major Division I-A college football programs took interest in taking part in the historic game, including Florida, University of Miami, Florida State, Penn State, Alabama, Texas and UCLA. With the relatively short notice, interested teams needed to rearrange their schedules as the NCAA did not grant the game an exception to its then-rule permitting only 11 regular season games. To help encourage teams, Raycom offered US$300,000 to participating schools; however, the logistics remained difficult. Some teams, like Miami, were concerned <b>about</b> <b>playing</b> a difficult game abroad; others, like Florida, were unable to get out of previously scheduled games. Teams like Wisconsin and Penn State were concerned about losing a home game and the extra income generated by such games (in some cases over $1 million). Also, with the game to be broadcast on ABC, teams in the Southeastern Conference, like Florida, had to further sort out complications with their exclusive television contract with TBS. By early November, the field of candidates was reduced to USC and Illinois: Kansas was willing to release USC from its commitment during that week and Illinois was open to having Raycom buy out one of its already scheduled games. The match-up was officially confirmed on November 15.|$|E
25|$|The Nets {{were founded}} as WTT's charter {{franchise}} for Cincinnati, Ohio in 1973, by Bill DeWitt, Jr. and Brian Heekin. Within weeks of being established, {{and before the}} team ever had a name in Cincinnati, DeWitt and Heekin sold it to Cleveland radio executive Joseph Zingale who paid them the same $50,000 as the franchise fee they had paid to WTT. Zingale relocated the team to Cleveland {{with a plan to}} have it play its home matches at the Cleveland Public Hall starting with the league's inaugural 1974 season and name it the Cleveland Nets. Before the draft, Zingale spoke to Clark Graebner, a native of Cleveland, <b>about</b> <b>playing</b> for the team as well as to being its coach and general manager. Graebner insisted his wife, Carole, had to be drafted by the team as well. The Nets selected them both as a pair in the fourth round of the draft. No other WTT team objected to the Nets selecting two players with one draft choice. When Clark and Carole Graebner separated, Clark traded Carole to the Pittsburgh Triangles. The couple never divorced, and Carole Graebner died in 2008. Peaches Bartkowicz was a key women's doubles player for the 1974 Nets but quit the team during the season. Through all the drama, the Nets finished with 21 wins and 23 losses, third in the Atlantic Section and snuck into the playoffs.|$|E
