500|$|Cellador Productions of Bangalore {{worked on}} the film's sound design; Nixon George and Rajeesh K. R. {{designed}} its soundscape. Since Maheshinte Prathikaram was set in Prakash City in Idukki, it required natural sounds which blended with the dialogue and music instead of dominating them. George and Rajeesh recorded in all the locations and found it of great help during the final editing process. Creating sound effects for the climactic fight was difficult: [...] "We used <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> meat to produce the sound effects of punches and kicks. It {{took a long time}} and a lot of trial and error". Editor Saiju Sreedharan was the film's colourist, correcting the colour grading and developing its digital intermediate.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{the goal}} of the New York Public Library and the architects who {{designed}} the new library branch in the Bronx to continue the tradition of the accessible library model established by Carnegie.

2500|$|During the {{dismantling}} of the Ottoman Empire after the war, most of Ottoman Syria came under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and most of Ottoman Iraq came under British mandate. Heated and prolonged negotiations ensued regarding which companies could invest in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The TPC was granted exclusive oil exploration rights to Mesopotamia in 1925. The discovery of a large oil reserve at Baba Gurgur provided the impetus to conclude negotiations and in July 1928 an agreement, called the [...] "Red Line Agreement", was signed which determined which oil companies could invest in TPC and reserved 5% of the shares for Gulbenkian. The name of the company was changed to the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929. The Pasha had actually given Gulbenkian the entire Iraqi oil concession. Gulbenkian, however, saw advantage in divesting the vast majority of his concession so that corporations would be able to develop the whole. Gulbenkian grew wealthy on the remainder. He reputedly said, [...] "Better a small piece of a big pie, than <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> a small one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Muslim luthras {{are present}} in Pakistan. They claim that their {{ancestors}} were related to aror sindh and they belong to Khashatriya. They link themselves to utradi aroras. After attack of arbis on Sindh, they migrated to Punjab. In Punjab they settled in Multan, Jhung and Lahore. Majority of Luthras settled in areas around the river Chenab. Majority of them were cultivators. In Laliyan, small town in Jhung, luthras used to cultivate <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land. During Mughal era, especially during period of Aurangzeb, many Hindu tribes converted to Islam. Especially Rajput , jutts and people of many other castes converted to Islam. Llilyan was the main residence of Luthras and they were strict Hindus. Despite of that, some luthras converted to Islam. Following the custom, they accepted Islam {{in the presence of}} Bukhari sayyeds of Uch. After converting to Islam, Hindu luthras and Muslim luthras still lived together. After some time, Muslim luthras moved to Multan, Ram nagar (currently known as Rasool nagar), Gujranwala and Lahore. They opted trading as their profession. Even today luthras are prominent and integral part of society.|$|E

Haptic/tacit is a network formed between five makers and their mentors, from the 2013 cohort of the Hothouse programme for emerging makers.

5000|$|It was the Declaration of Saint-Ouen that {{prepared}} {{the way for}} the Restoration. Before the French Revolution, which radically and bloodily overthrew most aspects of French society's organisation, the only way constitutional change could be instituted was by extracting it from old legal documents that could be interpreted as agreeing with the proposal. Everything new had to be expressed as a righteous revival of something old that had lapsed and had been forgotten. This was also the means used for diminished aristocrats to get themselves <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the pie. In the 18th century, those gentry whose fortunes and prestige had diminished to the level of peasants would search diligently for every ancient feudal statute that might give them something. The [...] "ban," [...] for example, meant that all peasants had to grind their grain in their lord's mill. Therefore, these gentry came to the French States-General of 1789 fully prepared to press for the expansion of such practices in all provinces, to the legal limit. They were horrified when, for example, the French Revolution permitted common citizens to go hunting, one of the few perquisites that they had always enjoyed everywhere.|$|R

And at last my dream would be realised: I would sleep upon the water. And next morning I would wake upon the water; and thereafter all my days and nights would be on the water.|$|R
