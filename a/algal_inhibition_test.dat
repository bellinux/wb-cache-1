40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{electrochemical}} oxidation mechanisms of three typical fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs), and investigated residual antibacterial activity and toxicity changes after oxidation processes. Electrochemistry coupled to mass spectrometry (EC-MS) {{was used to}} study the oxidation processes of ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFL). Eight oxidation products for each parent compound were identified and their chemical structures were elucidated. The transformation trend of each product, with the continuous increase of voltage from 0 to 3000 mV, was recorded by online EC-MS. The oxidation pathways were proposed based on the structural information and transformation trends of oxidation products. We found the oxidation mechanisms of FQs consisted of the hydroxylation and cleavage of piperazinyl ring via reactions with hydroxyl radicals, while the fluoroquinolone core remained intact. The antibacterial activity of the parent compounds and their oxidation mixtures was estimated using zone <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> for gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium. It {{was found that the}} oxidation mixtures of CIP and NOR retained the antibacterial properties with lower activity compared to their parent compounds, while the antibacterial activity of OFL was almost eliminated after oxidation. Furthermore, the toxicity of the three FQs and their oxidation mixtures were evaluated using <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> (Desmodesmus subspicatus). The median effective concentration (EC 50) values for the <b>algal</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> were calculated for the end point of growth rate. The toxicity of CIP and NOR to green algae after electrochemical oxidation, remained unchanged, while that of OFL significantly increased.

40|$|The aquatic {{toxicity}} of sulfaquinoxaline (SQO) and sulfaguanidine (SGD) was evaluated {{on the following}} test organisms: Daphnia magna (reproduction test), Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Scenedesmus dimorphus, Synecococcus leopoliensis (<b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test)</b> and Lemna gibba (duckweed growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test).</b> Furthermore, the additivity of the two compounds was measured on D. magna (acute immobilisation test) and P. subcapitata (<b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test)</b> using the isobologram method. Results show that SQO and SGD are more toxic to green algae and daphnids, respectively, than other veterinary sulfonamides (SAs) and that their mixtures have a less then additive interaction. Taking into account the highest concentrations detected so far in surface waters for SQO (0. 112 lg L_ 1) and for SGD (0. 145 lg L_ 1) and the lowest NOECs obtained with the five test organisms, divided by an assessment factor of 10, the following PNECs and risk quotients (RQs) were calculated. SQO: PNEC 2 lg L_ 1; RQ 0. 056. SGD: PNEC 39. 5 lg L_ 1; RQ 0. 004. Consequently, at the concentrations actually detected in the aquatic environment, the two SAs alone should not harm the freshwater organisms. However, it seems advisable, for veterinary mass treatments, the use of other SAs that have a lesser impact on the aquatic environment. Furthermore, considering the high probability of having complex mixtures of different SAs residues in water, each individual contamination should be evaluated by applying to the SAs mixtures the conservative criteria of additivity...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the apparent toxicity of strong chelators in standard <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> (e. g. method OECD 201, EC C. 3., ISO 8692) is related to essential trace metal bioavailability. This hypothesis was investigated for the chelator [S,S]-ethylene diamine disuccinate ([S,S]-EDDS) and the green alga Chlorella vulgaris. Metal speciation calculations were used to help design the algal growth experiments and interpret the data. Results suggest that interaction of the chelator with trace metals alters the free metal concentration and affects algal population growth, as opposed to a direct interaction between the alga and the chelator (toxicity sensu stricto). Even low levels of [S,S]-EDDS (i. e. 3 mg l- 1 or less) reduce the free p(Cu) and p(Zn) (p(Metal) = -log[Metal]) in standard OECD medium below 16 and 11, respectively, which are the minimum levels required to support algal growth. Nutrient deficiency was overcome by supplementing the medium with appropriate amounts of the trace metals Cu, Zn and Co, but not by increasing the hardness of the medium. A short-term photosynthesis inhibition experiment with the alga Selenastrum capricornutum in metal-free medium showed only a minimal effect of[S,S]-EDDS on the 14 C-CO 2 fixation rate. About 10 % inhibition was observed at 100 mg [S,S]-EDDS l- 1, i. e. the EC 50 for CO 2 fixation is greater than 100 mg l- 1. Results from this study illustrate that the standard <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> is not well suited to the assessment of algal toxicity (sensu stricto) of strong chelators. The no-effect level and EC 50 value are probably overestimated by at least one order of magnitude for [S,S]-EDDS.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to examine pesticide mixture toxicity {{and its effects on}} aquatic biota in agricultural streams. This was accomplished by (1) calculating the ΣTUs for algae and Daphnia magna and a pesticide toxicity index (PTI) based on water quality standards (WQS) for long-term monitoring data (2002 - 2010), (2) by performing <b>algal</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, using both collected in situ water samples and reconstituted water spiked with field-observed pesticide mixtures, and (3) by studying seasonal changes in macroinvertebrate and diatom communities during 2008 in four agricultural streams and determine a set of community-based metrics such as species richness, diversity, ASPT, SPEAR and IPS. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used to analyse community changes. Long-term data showed that collected stream water samples had peaks of estimated pesticide toxicity, mainly due to herbicides though insecticides and fungicides also contributed. ∑TUalgae, based on weekly average concentrations, exceeded 0. 1 on 28 out of 902 occasions, and 8 of these were higher than 0. 2. Only one or a few pesticides contributed to a major part of estimated mixture toxicity in the streams. The <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> studies in spiked water showed negative effects at pesticide concentrations corresponding to those found in stream water samples, indicating that pesticide effects on algae occur under in situ conditions. The field study also showed effects of pesticides, suggesting diatom diversity as a sensitive indicator of pesticide effects. Macroinvertebrate community changes were primarily explained by physiochemical conditions, though some non-insect invertebrates decreased (Asellus aquaticus) or increased (Oligochaeta) with pesticide exposure. Somewhat surprisingly, the SPEARpesticides index, specifically developed to detect pesticide effects of macro-invertebrate communities in streams, was not related to pesticide toxicity. The SPEAR index may need to be modified to better fit to Swedish conditions. A combination of chemical and biological monitoring is needed to increase our understanding of the relationship between pesticide stress and the biological diversity of agricultural streams. Specific endpoints and analysis methods are also needed to separate effects of pesticides from effects of other stressors. ...|$|R

The former tests were performed with Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria (Lumistox test), the cladoceran Daphnia magna and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata algae, and the latter with Thamnotoxkit F (TM) (Thamnocephalus platyurus), Ostracodtoxkit F (R) (Heterocypris incongruens) and LuminoTox (photosynthetic enzyme complexes). In the range of formicide concentrations tested (from 0. 06 to 2. 0 g L- 1), the measurement endpoint values varied from 0. 79 g L- 1 for the algal test to > 2 g L- 1 for the LuminoTox and Ostracodtoxkit F (R) tests.

Using the <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test,</b> the green algae median Effective Concentration (EC 50) values ranged from 0. 341 mu M for PCB 28 to more than 100 mu M for PCBs 101 and 153. Considering the MTT viability test, the abalone EC 50 values ranged from 1. 67 mu M for PCB 153 to 89 mu M for PCB 28. Our results in contrast to previous observation in vertebrates did not show significant differences between the dioxin like- and non dioxin like-PCBs toxicities regardless of the model used. However, our results demonstrated that the toxicities of PCBs were species dependent. For example, PCB 28 was the most toxic compound for P. subcapitata whereas PCBs 1, 180 and 153 were less toxic for that species. On the contrary, PCB 153 was reported as the most toxic for H. tuberculata haemocytes and PCB 28 the least toxic. To investigate the mode of action of these compounds, we used an in silico method. Our results suggested that PCBs have a non-specific mode of action (e. g., narcosis) on green algae, and another mode of action, probably more specific than narcosis, was reported for PCBs on the abalone haemocytes.

Both techniques were used to investigate the effects produced on Chlorella vulgaris cells by six compounds: the chemical intermediates bromobenzene and diethanolamine, the antioxidant propyl gallate, the semiconductor indium nitrate, the pesticide sodium monofluoroacetate and the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Electron transfer activity of the photosystem II significantly decreased after the exposure of Chlorella cells to all the six chemicals used. Lipid peroxidation was slightly decreased by the antioxidant propyl gallate, not changed by indium nitrate and very potently stimulated by diethanolamine, chloroquine, sodium monofluoroacetate and bromobenzene.

However, increases in IC 10 and IC 20 values indicated some amelioration of copper toxicity. When intact biofilms were added to the bioassays, amelioration of toxicity was more consistent, probably due to increased binding of copper to cell surfaces or exudates.

The phytotoxic effect of the culture filtrate decreased gradually in the order: oligotrophication, eutrophication, and mesotrophication. Co-culture in different nutrient conditions showed that <b>algal</b> <b>inhibition</b> by living A. philoxeroides plants occurred in the order: eutrophication> oligotrophication> mesotrophication.

30|$|The {{impact of}} shading must be {{accounted}} for when conducting <b>algal</b> growth rate <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with nanoparticles as indicated by ECHA in their updated version of the nanospecific appendix to R. 7 b. In certain cases, nanoparticles {{may be expected to}} reduce light availability to the alga, i.e., for nanoparticles that (1) produce dark/turbid media suspensions, (2) adhere to algal surfaces, or (3) have relatively low toxicity and, therefore, require to be tested in exposure concentrations in {{the upper end of the}} CLP classification range (10 – 100  mg/L). Shading effects are most easily studied in testing setups where the NP suspensions are physically contained separately and placed in between the light source and the container with algae. While such setups fail to disclose localized shading caused by nanoparticles adhering to algal cells, they are practically feasible with only minor additional testing required. For daphnia testing, nanoparticles that undergo agglomeration/aggregation and sedimentation or visibly adhere to the exterior of the daphnia are likely to induce physical effects causing immobility and/or death. This behavior often occurs when nanoparticles in powder-form are suspended in test media. Also, a mesh can be inserted in test beakers to keep daphnids from contact with nanoparticles deposited on the bottom of the test beakers.|$|R
30|$|Some key EnvNano findings, such as {{the need}} to {{characterize}} dispersion and dissolution rates in stock and test media, have been addressed in the updated guidance. However, {{it has to be}} further specified that multiple characterization methods should be applied to describe state of dispersion and dissolution over time and for various test concentration. More detailed information is called for on the specific characterization methods and techniques available and their pros and cons. The importance of considering the impact of shading is also mention in the ECHA guidance, but limited guidance is provided on how to account for this when conducting <b>algal</b> growth rate <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with nanoparticles. In general, more specific guidance is needed on methods to discriminate between different types of effects including physical effects, effects caused by dissolved ions and nanoparticle effects. In algal tests, shading can be studied in testing setups where the nanoparticle suspensions are physically contained separately and placed in between the light source and the container with algae. Although such tests cannot disclose localized shading caused by nanoparticles adhering to algal cells, they are practically feasible with only minor additional testing required. In daphnia tests, a mesh can be inserted in test beakers to keep daphnids from contact with nanoparticles deposited {{on the bottom of the}} test beakers, thereby facilitating the discrimination between different types of effects.|$|R
3000|$|... 'Personal Care Products'; also {{referred}} to as cosmetic products or cosmetics in the European Union (EU), contain a multitude of chemicals used for different purposes. The chemicals used to introduce certain functions in personal care products show different properties. Due to some of these properties (e.g. low water solubility) environmental behavior and effects are not easily determined. For many of these substances, ecotoxicological testing is technically not feasible or very expensive. Due to this lack of appropriate testing tools, recent research is increasingly interested in this substance group [1]. 'Poorly soluble substances', which are characterised by low water solubility (< 1 mg/l), may constitute a substantial proportion of the ingredients in some 'personal care products'. Such ingredients with essential function are used in numerous cosmetic products, e.g. as emulsifiers. The extensive usage results in high production volumes and thereby requires an assessment of the environmental behavior and the toxicity of these substances to aquatic organisms to fulfill the requirements of the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. For manufacturers or importers as responsible registrants, risk assessment is necessary to demonstrate product safety for human health and the environment. At the threshold of the water solubility of the substance, toxicity tests are very difficult to conduct and cannot be performed as a matter of routine. High lipophilicity and high adsorption potential might cause an extensive adsorption of the substance to surfaces, e.g. to the test vessels or test organisms. This might complicate testing procedures, and analytical determination of the substance. As a consequence, the measured concentrations in the test solution are likely to be significantly lower than the nominal concentrations. It also raises difficulties in quantifying the substances with analytical methods because of their low concentration in the water phase. For these reasons standard tests such as the Daphnia acute immobilisation test or the <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test,</b> which are required for the REACH registration, might provide insufficient results and are thereby often not appropriate for a realistic risk assessment.|$|R
40|$|An aqueous {{dispersion}} of poly (acrylic acid) -stabilised cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles (PAA-CeO 2) was evaluated for its stability {{in a range}} of freshwater ecotoxicity media (MHRW, TG 201 and M 7), with and without natural organic matter (NOM). In a 15 day dispersion stability study, PAA-CeO 2 did not undergo significant aggregation in any media type. Zeta potential varied between media types and was influenced by PAA-CeO 2 concentration, but remained constant over 15 days. NOM had no influence on PAA-CeO 2 aggregation or zeta potential. The ecotoxicity of the PAA-CeO 2 dispersion was investigated in 72 h <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> using the freshwater microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. PAA-CeO 2 EC 50 values for growth inhibition (GI; 0. 024 mg/L) were 2 – 3 orders of magnitude lower than pristine CeO 2 EC 50 values reported in the literature. The concentration of dissolved cerium (Ce 3 +/Ce 4 +) in PAA-CeO 2 exposure suspensions was very low, ranging between 0. 5 and 5. 6 μg/L. Free PAA concentration in the exposure solutions (0. 0096 – 0. 0384 mg/L) was significantly lower than the EC 10 growth inhibition (47. 7 mg/L) value of pure PAA, indicating that free PAA did not contribute to the observed toxicity. Elemental analysis indicated that up to 38 % of the total Cerium becomes directly associated with the algal cells during the 72 h exposure. TOF-SIMS analysis of algal cell wall compounds indicated three different modes of action, including a significant oxidative stress response to PAA-CeO 2 exposure. In contrast to pristine CeO 2 nanoparticles, which rapidly aggregate in standard ecotoxicity media, PAA-stabilised CeO 2 nanoparticles remain dispersed and available to water column species. Interaction of PAA with cell wall components, which could be responsible for the observed biomarker alterations, could not be excluded. This study indicates that the increased dispersion stability of PAA-CeO 2 leads to an increase in toxicity compared to pristine non-stabilised forms...|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} {{aquatic toxicity}} tests utilized for dose–response assessment of nanoparticles were originally developed to reflect direct toxic effects of soluble chemicals. Nanoparticles are inherently different from soluble chemicals, {{as they are}} suspended in media rather than dissolved, and the effects arising from contact between the nanoparticles and the organism may result from physical interferences, rather than direct toxicity [74]. The adhesion of nanoparticles to test organisms has been frequently reported [e.g., 1, 2, 10, 13, 16, 38, 39, 55, 66; Sørensen et al. 2015; 81]. In immobilization tests with crustaceans, the nanoparticle adhesion to antennas and exoskeleton of the organism may mechanically impair their mobility, as observed for platinum nanoparticles (Sørensen et al., 2015) and TiO 2 [16]. Sørensen et al. (2015) concluded mortality {{to be a more}} appropriate endpoint than immobility, in order to account for toxicity rather than physical restriction. However, it should be acknowledged that immobility is a more sensitive endpoint and that mortality may in fact be caused by nanoparticle adhesion. No matter whether immobility or mortality is used as endpoint, it is strongly recommended to supplement the observation with visual inspections of immobile and dead animals to take the possibility of physical effects into account. In <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests,</b> nanoparticle adhesion to alga may inhibit growth by influencing the nutrient or light availability (shading). Several studies have investigated the influence of nanoparticle shading using setups that separate the algae from the nanoparticle suspensions. Such studies have both confirmed and rejected the influence of shading on <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> [2, 38, 46, 71, 82]. Significant shading has been identified for Pt nanoparticles of relatively low toxicity with EC 50 values in the higher end of the CLP classification range for aquatic toxicity (10 – 100  mg/L) [78]. This exemplifies the need to account for shading effects, even at relatively high concentrations, when conducting aquatic toxicity tests for dose–response assessment purposes. Under the current standard testing scheme, physical effects are considered a confounding factor rather than actual toxic effects. Thus, physical effects need to be accounted for and eliminated as best possible. It could be argued that some physical effects of nanoparticles constitute environmentally relevant effect mechanisms different from what is known for dissolved chemicals. For example, it may also be argued that certain physical effects (e.g., algal shading caused by turbid suspensions) are artefacts, whereas others (such as algal shading on a cellular level caused by adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell surface) should be considered NP-specific effects and hence not a confounding factor. As a minimum, however, it is important to account for the different types of physical and chemical effects that contribute to the overall measured effect in the test.|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{position of}} micro-algae {{at the base}} of the aquatic food web makes them critical components of aquatic ecosystems. Their short generation time also makes them useful biological indicators because they respond quickly to changes in environmental condition, enabling timely identification and assessment of water quality changes. The inclusion of micro-algae as indicators in water resource regulation and management in South Africa has started recently, their more extensive use in biomonitoring and ecotoxicology programmes for water resource management would contribute to the South African policy if water resource protection. The standard <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> assay with the species Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata is currently used for monitoring toxicity of in-stream and industrial wastewater discharges to freshwater micro-algae. The relevance of the data generated by standard toxicity bioassays has been questioned, since micro-algae in particular are extremely variable in their sensitivity to a range of contaminants and these standard species used may not occur in the local aquatic environment. As a result, international regulatory agencies, have recommended <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> be changed from a single standard species to tests with a number of species. One recommendation, in addition to the use of standard toxicity tests, is the use of species isolated from the local environment which may be more relevant for assessing site specific impacts. This study investigated the value and application of locally isolated South African freshwater micro-algae in toxicity tests for water resource management and was carried out in three phases. The first phase involved isolating micro-algae from South African aquatic resources. Micro-algae suitable for toxicity testing were identified and selected using as set of criteria. Three (Scenedesmus bicaudatus, Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlorella vulgaris) out of eight successfully isolated species satisfied the prescribed selection criteria and these were selected as potential toxicity test species. The second phase focused on refining and adapting the existing algal toxicity test protocol (the <b>algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> assay) for use on the locally isolated algal species. The refinement of the test protocol was achieved by exposing the locally isolated species to reference toxicants in order to assess and compare their growth and sensitivity to the toxicants under the prescribed toxicity test conditions with that of the standard toxicity test species (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and a commercial laboratory species (Chlorella protothecoides). During this phase, one of the three local species (Scenedesmus bicaudatus) was eliminated as a potential toxicity test species due to inconsistent growth. The third phase of the study involved assessing the sensitivity of the two remaining species (C. vulgaris and C. sorokiniana) to a range of toxicants (reference toxicants, salts, effluents and a herbicide) and comparing it to that of the standard toxicity test species P. subcapitata and C. protothecoides. The toxicants were selected based on their relative importance in the South African context, as well as the practicality of using these local micro-algae to routinely determine the impact of these toxicants on local aquatic resources. The growth of the four micro-algae was stimulated by the selected effluents. The standard toxicity test species P. subcapitata was ranked the most sensitive and of the four species to two reference toxicants and two inorganic salts. Chlorella sorokiniana was ranked the most sensitive of the three Chlorella species to two reference toxicants and two inorganic salts. The herbicide stimulated the growth of C. vulgaris while inhibiting the growth of the other species. Pseudokirchneriela subcapitata and C. sorokiniana showed high intra-specific variability in growth, which made it difficult to determine the effective concentrations of the herbicide and therefore compare the sensitivity of the species. This varied response of micro-algal species to toxicants may result in the biodiversity shifts in aquatic ecosystems, and also supports the recommendation of using a battery of different species to support more informed decisions in water resource management...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} {{integrity of}} aquatic ecosystems has become {{threatened by the}} effects of high nutrient loads, inorganic and organic chemicals. The effect of these xenobiotics needs to be investigated by the application of biotests in whole effluent toxicity testing and biomarkers in active biomonitoring. Whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing determines the toxicity/effect of whole effluent on aquatic organisms. Sub-lethal effects can be determined by analysing the levels of subcellular/physiological indicators/enzymes in aquatic organisms exposed to in situ conditions. The procedure used for in situ assessments was active biomonitoring (ABM). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the instream health of a known contaminated system (Rietvlei Wetland System, Gauteng, South Africa) using WET and ABM methodologies. Three sites in the Rietvlei Wetland System were selected and sampling was undertaken during high flow (April 2003) and low flow (August 2003) periods. The ABM sampling protocol involved the deployment of aquatic molluscs (Melanoides tuberculata) and fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) for a period of four weeks at the sites. Following the four week exposure period the organisms were transported back to the laboratory and the following biomarkers were assessed: ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and metallothione (MT). Water samples were also collected for WET testing during the low flow period, since this was the only period where mortality was observed in the ABM organisms. Standard WET protocols were used to assess the toxicity of the water from the three sites. These protocols were: 96 h Poecilia reticulata lethality test, 48 h Daphnia pulex lethality test and 72 h Selenastrum capricorutum growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> In addition the same biomarker analyses that were done on the ABM organisms were carried out on WET exposed D. pulex and P. reticulata. The WET testing and ABM indicated highest toxicity at Sites 1 and 3. <b>Algal</b> growth <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> showed highest stimulation of algal growth at Site 2 and inhibition at Site 3. Sites 1 and 2 showed signs of contamination by organophosphates and carbamates due to elevated AChE and reduced EROD. However there were no significant differences in AChE activity between fish tested in the 96 h toxicity test and those used in ABM. Very low AChE activity was recorded in D. pulex. Snails also had lower AChE activity when compared to the exposed fish species. Metallothionein content was higher in field-exposed fish than those used in WET, however both assessment protocols indicated that Site 3 was affected the greatest by metals. Snails exhibited higher MT content than fish and D. pulex showed no MT activity. There were no significant differences in MT content between the sites. Acetylcholine esterase appears to be a relevant means of investigating biological effects of many neurotoxic contaminants on aquatic habitats and trophic levels. Metallothionein content is a good indicator of toxicity due to heavy metals for active biomonitoring as well as the WET test. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase is a more difficult biomarker to work with since it shows no differences in activity between control and exposed organisms. The EROD assay does not detect very low levels of EROD induction. Acetylecholinesterase and MT are the recommended biomarker assays for the detection of sublethal responses in the WET laboratory toxicity test. The AChE activities and MT exhibit comparable results in both ABM and WET assessment protocols. In future studies WET testing needs to be complimented with a suite biomarker analyses to determine the type of pollutants in a system and sufficiently describe the pollution status of a system.
