2500|$|Artificial {{body part}} {{replacements}} {{are one of}} the many applications of bionics. Concerned with the intricate and thorough study of the properties and function of human body systems, bionics may be applied to solve some engineering problems. Careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes, ears, and other organs paved the way for improved cameras, television, radio transmitters and receivers, and many other useful tools. These developments have indeed made our lives better, but the best contribution that bionics has made is in the field of biomedical engineering (the building of useful replacements for various parts of the human body). Modern hospitals now have <b>available</b> <b>spare</b> parts to replace body parts badly damaged by injury or disease [...] Biomedical engineers work hand in hand with doctors to build these artificial body parts.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2012, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{electrical}} transformers involved in the ship's propulsion system failed, after an earlier engineers report highlighted [...] "overheating of the propulsion motors and transformers". Inspection found that insulation failure had short-circuited the transformer, while other transformers aboard showed premature wear. Unable to find an <b>available</b> <b>spare,</b> a new unit had to be ordered from the manufacturer. In June, it was predicted that Choules would be out of service for four to five months, but by October, claims were made that the ship would be inoperable until at least January 2013, and if all of the wear-showing transformers were replaced, she would not return to service until April 2013. By December, the faulty transformer had been replaced, and the RAN had decided that although the other transformers (propulsion and others) had been shown to have acceptable levels of wear, all would be replaced before Choules was reactivated. These repairs were completed in early 2013, and the ship was assessed as ready to re-enter service on 12 April.|$|E

50|$|On 21 February, the {{decision}} was made to equip all Bomber Command aircraft with H2S, not only as a bombing aid, but a navigation aid as well. In early operations, H2S had proved able to detect coastlines at such a great distance that it could be used as a long-range navigation system, allowing the aircraft to fly in all weather. To aid the navigator, the bomb aimer has the task of operating the H2S during these periods. To further improve operations, on 12 March it was decided that Bomber Command would receive more of the <b>available</b> <b>spares,</b> as it was believed that they would need to make up for higher casualty rates. Previously every equipped squadron was required to hold 100% spares for all parts, and there simply weren't enough to go around.|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} for {{industrial}} installations to be in operation for several decades, which means that upgrading the control systems of these plants is an imperative for several reasons. As new hardware and software solutions become <b>available,</b> <b>spares</b> are increasingly hard to find and technical support for the old hardware is dropped by the vendors. Lost or non-existing documentation turns usage by new operators needlessly hard and maintenance work or modifications nearly impossible. This paper deals with one such case: the upgrade process of the control system for the Chemical Polishing machine used at CERN for the surface treatment of superconducting RF cavities. It was developed back in 1989, based on Siemens S 5 PLCs and a custom HMI. In order to guarantee a smooth and swift transition, CERN's own framework for process control (UNICOS-CPC) was used {{to develop a new}} control system, based in current Siemens control solutions. Ideally, this study may serve {{as a starting point for}} other engineers dealing with a similar situation...|$|R

50|$|The {{degree of}} {{saturation}} (%) is a ratio of demand to capacity on each approach to the junction, with a value of 100% meaning that demand and capacity are equal and no further traffic is able to progress through the junction. Values over 85% are typically regarded as suffering from traffic congestion, with queues of vehicles beginning to form. The term practical reserve capacity (PRC) {{is often used to}} refer to the <b>available</b> <b>spare</b> capacity at a junction. A negative PRC indicates that the junction is over capacity.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a computer simulation model for determining effective spares stock levels for recoverable items at Air Force bases and depots. The simulation model {{is based on}} the following fundamental inventory theory; whenever a demand arises, it is satisfied from stock on hand, and the quantity equal to that demand is recorded immediately; when a demand exceeds stock on hand, the excess demand is backordered immediately and when item life expires procurement action is initiated at depot level. The resulting product of the model cam be used as a guide for the optimum distribution of <b>available</b> <b>spares</b> or as a computation of the necessary spares which will meet a desired percent fill rate. Outputs from the simulation model will also enable evaluation of the spares level effects as a result of change in other logistic parameters. The purpose of this thesis is two-fold {{to the extent that it}} presents: (a) A computer simulation model of an Air Force logistic system; and (b) A discussion of compound Monte-Carlo demand generation involving various analytic failure distributions. The specific nature of the problem to which the simulation model is applied is described and the model construction and output are discussed in detail...|$|R
5000|$|Within a {{few hours}} Lloyd had made an {{inspection}} tour of the airfields and the main workshops at Kalafrana. The state of the island was worse than he expected. The slackening of German air activity had allowed the number of aircraft to increase, but the RAF still had fewer than 60 machines of all types. Maintenance was difficult. Hardly any spare or replacement parts were <b>available.</b> <b>Spares</b> had to be obtained by sifting through the debris of wrecks or by cannibalising undamaged aircraft. Furthermore, the airfields were too small; there was no heavy equipment to work with; and even the commonest sorts of tools, such as hammers and wrenches, were all but impossible to find. All refuelling {{had to be done}} by hand from individual drums. The shelter was also inadequate, so there was little protection for what equipment they did have. Most aircraft were clustered together on open runways, presenting tempting targets. At Kalafrana, all the buildings were close together and above ground. The single engine-repair facility on Malta was located right next to the only test benches. Lloyd himself said, [...] "a few bombs on Kalafrana in the summer of 1941 would have ruined any hope of Malta ever operating an air force".|$|R

50|$|In June 1939, {{in light}} of the declining {{situation}} in Europe and the increasing likelihood of a major conflict, the Chief of the Air staff recommended the expansion of the RAAF to a total of 32 squadrons; of these, preparations for 9 general purpose squadrons, which were intended to be equipped with the Wirraway, were immediately put into motion. On 25 August 1939, one month after the first deliveries of the Wirraway had occurred, an official State of Emergency was declared; on 3 September 1939, as the Second World War broke out in Europe, Australia decided to mobilise the entirety of its air force, placing all squadrons on short call for combat operations. However, {{during the first year of}} the war, the Wirraway was still being introduced in quantity within many squadrons; this effort was delayed by a temporary shortage of <b>available</b> <b>spare</b> parts.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, TWA {{decided to}} replace its fleet of Boeing 727 Series 100 {{aircraft}} {{with the former}} Ozark DC-9s. This decision {{was based on the}} economics of operating three-crew airplanes (727s) with three engines, versus operating two-crew airplanes (DC-9s) with two engines. Both airplanes had about the same passenger and cargo capacity, so it was decided to replace the Boeing fleet. To prepare for this transition, TWA positioned several million dollars worth of spare parts for the DC-9s in Germany. This was a requirement dictated by the German government. If TWA wanted to use DC-9s {{in the service of the}} German population, then TWA had to provide readily <b>available</b> <b>spare</b> parts for its fleet. The airline also sent its senior DC-9 pilots (known as Check Airmen) to Europe to observe the operations in preparation for the changeover of the crews that was to follow. Shortly before the DC-9 airplanes began arriving in Germany, however, the entire plan was cancelled because the leasing contracts that Carl Icahn had created for the former Ozark DC-9s specifically forbade any operations outside the continental limits of the United States.|$|E
50|$|When {{they arrived}} to the 25th Division HQ, it was a beehive of {{activity}} as they were coordinating to secure their sector of the UN battleline. After explaining directly to the American HQ commanders of the 10th situation, they gave him free rein in the division's supply depot and motor pool to take whatever Liwanag needed. Without conferring to his battalion commanders on items they had on hand, he secured the items that were available before they were requisitioned to another unit. When he returned, {{to the surprise of}} everyone in the battalion, he was able to secure seven M24 Chaffee light tanks as their only replacement armor, and riding behind them were several more truckloads of brand new heavy weapons ranging from machine guns of different variants, bazookas, grenades and mortars - along with more ammunition for the entire battalion's needs. There were no <b>available</b> <b>spare</b> Shermans, as all replacement tanks would take several weeks to be shipped in from the US mainland. The Recon Company received the Chaffees, which was a far better light tank compared to their under-gunned, slow, obsolete M5 Stuarts. All the truckloads of new heavy weaponry he collected went to the tankless Tank Company which he reorganize them as a Heavy Weapons Company, which the battalion commander and the Tank Company's commander, Captain Conrado D. Yap, approved to Liwanag's re-assessment. Near the city of Miryang, the battalion spent about two weeks of pre-combat training with their new equipment and their change of combat duties, namely the Heavy Weapons Company. Liwanag became directly responsible in reshaping the new company and closely working together with Capt. Yap, made sure that his newly reassigned company functions smoothly.|$|E
