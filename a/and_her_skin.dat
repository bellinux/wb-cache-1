500|$|The {{story was}} further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the {{operator}} of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a [...] "victim [...] obviously had her arms amputated <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> peeled {{off in a}} circular pattern, making {{her look like a}} human caterpillar," [...] and another who had had her limbs broken and reset [...] "at odd angles so she resembled a human crab". [...] Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were not supported by the sources given.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{friendships with}} Taylor and Rice {{continuing}} to deteriorate, Doggett forms friendships with Healy and Carrie [...] "Big Boo" [...] Black (played by Lea DeLaria). Healy and Doggett unite to form [...] "Safe Place", a therapy group where prisoners can share their feelings in a confidential and supportive environment. [...] "Safe Place" [...] is short-lived, however, and Healy decides {{to cancel the}} group indefinitely after Doggett fails to attend one of the sessions; when he investigates her reason for non-attendance, he finds her getting a hair cut from Burset. Doggett initially talks to Big Boo, an openly lesbian inmate, during a blackout in the prison as she believes {{that there is a}} secret 'gay agenda' and she believes that Big Boo will give her the answers that she is seeking. Doggett's physical appearance also changes in this season; she has white false teeth, neater hair <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> looks smoother.|$|E
500|$|Elaine {{is usually}} {{depicted}} as a beautiful woman with long red hair and with green eyes. She wears a variety of pirate clothing consistent with the game's Golden Age of Piracy setting; her outfit usually consists of pantaloons, a blouse worn under a lightweight tunic, a sash, boots and a headscarf. Elaine usually wears gold earrings, though by Tales of Monkey Island, she wears her diamond engagement ring as an earring until Chapter 2. Her appearances in The Secret of Monkey Island and [...] are {{in the form of}} pixel art, with appearances slightly differing between the EGA, Amiga and VGA versions of the games. By The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine is rendered in a cartoon art style by LucasArts artists Larry Ahern and Bill Tiller, although the character's choice of clothing remains consistent. Escape from Monkey Island translated Ahern and Tiller's depiction into 3D graphics, while the later special editions and Tales of Monkey Island produced a more stylized art form for the character. While under LeChuck's influence as his demon bride in Tales of Monkey Island, Elaine is dressed in a Gothic wedding dress and a tiara, her eyes are pupiless <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> is given a green hue.|$|E

5000|$|... "When {{she enters}} a room you feel here comes {{everything}} that is fresh, healthy <b>and</b> beautiful. <b>Her</b> <b>skin</b> glows warmly <b>and</b> <b>her</b> huge brown eyes are bright. An outdoor woman, she is full of indoor charm. Rides every day of her life." ...|$|R
60|$|Sophy drew up <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> brown <b>skin</b> glowed. Albinia {{feared that}} she had said the wrong thing, <b>and</b> affronted <b>her,</b> {{but it was all}} working in the dark.|$|R
500|$|Jennifer Cady of E! News {{found the}} video [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "pretty {{stripped}} down", further writing: [...] "There are no catchy choreographed dances or freakum dresses, just Queen Bey looking gorgeous in lingerie and belting out her love and devotion to her man." [...] Cady {{added that the}} video was entertaining because of Beyoncé [...] "seriously magical hair" [...] <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin,</b> which was sparkling like Edward Cullen. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly concluded that although the video {{was different from the}} previous [...] "heavily produced spectacles" [...] Beyoncé has made, [...] "it's hard to take your eyes off it". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic criticized the sex appeal which was used in the videos for Lady Gaga's [...] "You and I" [...] (2011) and Katy Perry's [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2011) but felt that [...] "Beyonce's game is unique in its reliance on pure visual magnetism". He wrote that even when Beyoncé is [...] "inhabiting apocalyptic warzones or Mad Men-era domestic scenes", she is always classical. Kornhaber concluded that the video for [...] "1+1" [...] is [...] "catchy, fun dance, pretty face, pretty body", which according to him, is what [...] "Beyonce [...] always been about". Melinda Newman from the website HitFix found [...] "some lovely kaleidoscopic shots and billowing sheets". She added that [...] "we never see her '+1' other than an arm and back shot, but that works to the video's advantage".|$|E
6000|$|... "My tidings are, Olaf, {{that the}} waters have suited the Augusta very well. She has lost several pounds in weight <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> is now {{like that of}} a young child." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{body was}} so thin {{that one could}} almost see her skeleton. Her chest was as flat as a boy's. Her mouth, with its narrow pale lips, was ugly, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> was faintly green.|$|E
60|$|I interpreted, <b>and</b> under <b>her</b> dark <b>skin</b> she {{actually}} seemed to blush.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This blue-eyed, pink-skinned, whitish filly {{is in fact}} a cremello, <b>and</b> is healthy. <b>Her</b> <b>skin</b> is a rosier shade <b>and</b> <b>her</b> coat cream-colored, {{as opposed}} to stark white.|$|R
60|$|Her {{ambition}} {{was to be}} short-lived, she divined {{from the}} lay of the land ahead, but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that would always blanch <b>her</b> cheeks <b>and</b> prick <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> in remembrance.|$|R
6000|$|She was right. She {{had no need}} of such gems. Was not {{her hair}} golden <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> alabaster? Were not her lips coral and her teeth pearls? And were not {{diamonds}} of the purest water dropping at that moment from her down-cast eyes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis lovely--I {{have seen}} that. I can take my oath to that. Her ladyship can sit upon it; and her figure is very fine; <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> is {{as white as}} snow; and her heart is the kindest that ever was; and I know, that is I feel sure, it is very tender about you, Mr. Warrington." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Mara {{knew that}} this letter was nothing in particular, but she was taken by surprise, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> was {{delicate}} as peach-blossom, and so she could not help a sudden blush, which rose even to her golden hair, vexed as she was to feel it coming. She put the letter quietly in her pocket, {{and for a moment}} seemed too discomposed to answer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, then, look about, Luka, {{and see if}} you {{can find}} a {{sheltered}} nook. I will pile stones into the well of the canoe so as to anchor her safely. If she were to be rolled over <b>and</b> over <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> would soon be cut to pieces." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{came to her}} willingly, and Dorothy {{passed her}} hands over their faces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age {{and the other a}} boy {{somewhat}} smaller. The girl's hair was soft and fluffy <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose and ears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed.|$|E
60|$|A fair sight was she in a robe of flame-coloured silk, with {{a collar}} of ruddy gold about her neck, bright with {{emeralds}} and rubies. More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands than the blossoms {{of the wood}} anemone. Four white trefoils sprang up where she trod, and therefore was she called Olwen.|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{did not say}} anything--did {{not know}} what to say. He was peculiarly {{conscious}} of the woman sitting next to him, her arm near his. She smoked heavily, in silence, as if abstracted, a sort of cloud on her level, dark brows. Her hair was dark, but a softish brown, not black, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> was fair. Her bosom would be white.--Why Aaron should have had this thought, he could not for the life of him say.|$|E
60|$|Engaging a tartana, {{he went to}} see Don Erminio. The captain's {{small house}} smelt of salt fish, garlic, and burned olive oil, and Señora Martinez {{received}} Kit in the court. She was fat <b>and</b> <b>her</b> brown <b>skin</b> was thickly powdered.|$|R
60|$|Kit {{imagined}} {{there was}} a joke, but since the joke was not obvious he studied Betty. She now wore a thin black dress, made in the Spanish fashion with black lace at the short sleeves <b>and</b> neck. <b>Her</b> <b>skin</b> was very white and smooth and Kit thought {{she looked as if}} she had always worn a dinner dress.|$|R
50|$|She-Hulk's body is superhumanly {{durable and}} nearly {{impervious}} to force, pain, <b>and</b> disease: <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> can withstand extremes of temperature, {{as well as}} tremendous stresses and impacts without puncture wounds or lacerations. Her enhanced physiology renders her immune to all terrestrial diseases. She-Hulk also possesses a healing factor, which enabled her to completely recover, within minutes, from a skewering by the Wendigo.|$|R
60|$|She {{went up to}} {{her room}} to smooth her hair before dinner. Yes, it was very nice light-brown hair, with a golden shine; {{and her eyes were}} very clear and blue, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> very white, with a rosy flush; and her nose was straight, and the shape was a pretty {{delicate}} one. Amy really did think Mr. Wingfield was right, and had better taste than the people who thought her a poor washy, peaky thing, as she had more than once heard herself called.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed the trapper, {{tossing a}} {{hand into the}} air as his whole countenance lighted with the {{recollections}} the name revived. [...] "They called her Alice! Elsie or Alice; 'tis all the same. A laughing, playful child she was, when happy; and tender and weeping in her misery! Her hair was shining and yellow, as the coat of the young fawn, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> clearer than the purest water that drips from the rock. Well do I remember her! I remember her right well!" ...|$|E
60|$|They went to {{the dining-room}} and at the door Jimmy stopped. Margaret and Jardine crossed the belt of {{polished}} wood between the pillars, but now Margaret was not dressed like a bush girl. The deerskin jacket was gone, her clothes were fashionable <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> shone against the fine dark-colored material. Yet she was marked by the grace and balance one gets in the woods, and Jimmy thought her step like a mountain deer's. Then he saw his uncle studied him and he crossed the floor.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Channard, {{seduced by}} Julia, has surreptitiously brought more mentally ill {{patients}} {{to his home}} for her to feed on. When Kirsty and the others arrive at Channard's home, MacRae heads to the attic, and discovers the grisly remains of their bodies. Julia, <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> almost completely regenerated, appears and kills him, consuming his essence <b>and</b> completing <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> regeneration. Kirsty hears the commotion and rushes up to the attic, and walks in on the scene. Enraged, she attacks Julia, but is knocked unconscious.|$|R
50|$|Following DC's 2011 {{relaunch}} of its titles, Harley Quinn's {{costume and}} appearance was fully revamped. The New 52 shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, <b>and</b> boots. <b>Her</b> hair color {{has also been}} altered to half-red <b>and</b> half-black <b>and</b> <b>her</b> bleached <b>skin</b> {{is the result of}} being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.|$|R
50|$|Since 2005, Manville has {{starred in}} several National Theatre productions, {{including}} His Dark Materials (2005), The Alchemist (2006) <b>and</b> <b>Her</b> Naked <b>Skin</b> (2008).

60|$|I {{left him}} {{to finish his}} short story and walked out across the circle of smooth lawn towards the golf links. And there I met Mrs. Cooke and her niece coming in together. The warm red of her costume became Miss Thorn wonderfully, and set off the glossy black of her hair. <b>And</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> was glowing from the exercise. An {{involuntary}} feeling of admiration for this tall, athletic young woman swept over me, and I halted in my steps for no other reason, I believe, than that I might look upon her the longer.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman stood}} looking at him with great, dark eyes in which joy, {{surprise}} and fear struggled for mastery. Her hair though still unruly was coiled around her head, her shift and kirtle were neatly fastened, but her legs and feet were bare and above the shift her neck and shoulders appeared colourless and attenuated. Eyes and hair were dark, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> had the olive tint of the south, but her lips at this moment looked bloodless, {{and there was the}} look of starvation in her wan face.|$|E
6000|$|I was in {{the room}} in a moment, and the others crowded through the door-way behind me. It was a good-sized bedroom, {{probably}} the [...] "spare-room" [...] of the first floor. In one corner was a tall and wide high-posted bedstead, and in the very middle of it sat an elderly woman drawn up into the smallest compass into which she could possibly compress herself. Her eyes were closed, her jaws were dropped, her spectacles hung in front of her mouth, her gray hair straggled over her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> was of a soapy whiteness.|$|E
2500|$|... : The second demon to be defeated, and {{the female}} lover of Gemma. She is a seductive woman who has snake tattoos all over her body that can come to life; she also can summon a larger {{quantity}} of snakes to envelope <b>her</b> victims <b>and</b> shed <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> She is killed by Yurimaru after she fails to kill Jubei, {{but also because of}} Yurimaru's jealousy towards her for being Gemma's lover.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} Cleopatra, Queen of Ancient Egypt, took baths in donkey milk to {{preserve}} the beauty <b>and</b> youth of <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> Legend has it that no less than 700 donkeys were needed to provide the quantity of milk necessary for her daily bath.|$|R
60|$|Beth Drexel emerged, first protesting {{that under}} no {{circumstances}} would she be guilty of riding the creatures, <b>and,</b> next, <b>her</b> brunette <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> dark eyes still flushed warm with sleep, greeting the two rescuers.|$|R
