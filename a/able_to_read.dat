5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and barely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained {{an interest in}} learning. In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell stated at the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. PaleyFest panel that the writers are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the screenplays for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films {{to know where}} the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a plan for the show through the end of a third season. On May 8, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season of 22 episodes.|$|E

5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} of the knowledge of Maya writing {{has been a long}} and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, {{universities}} were opened to women, allowing Rand {{to be in}} the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University. At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history. At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively. She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche. <b>Able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him {{with a list of}} 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which {{he argued that the}} language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E

5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Khmer.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 2008, NBC {{announced}} 30 Rock 360, {{an online}} {{extension of the}} 30Rock series. The extension featured Jack Donaghy's Online Business Courses (or Jack U).

Users were able to submit sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan and act out skits from TGS. The feature reopened Ask Tina, an interactive question and answer platform in which users could ask Fey questions. Fey answered the questions in video form. Ask Tina was a fixture on NBC.com's 30 Rock section throughout the first season.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they had to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} a {{foreigner}} who {{arrives in the}} Dyrwood. Their caravan is hit by a mysterious storm that kills everyone but them. Taking refuge in a cave, the player character witnesses some cultists perform a ritual on a machine that can strip souls from their bodies. Exposed to these energies, the player character becomes a Watcher, a person <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> souls. The player character also becomes Awakened, able to access memories of their past lives. This curses the Watcher with waking visions and an inability to sleep. In time, the Watcher will go insane from this, so they must track down the cultists and reverse the curse.|$|E

50|$|A newer {{model for}} reading development, {{specifically}} with regard <b>to</b> early <b>reading</b> development, is emergent literacy, {{sometimes referred to}} as early literacy, model. This model purports that children begin reading from birth, and that learning <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is an interactive process based on children’s exposure to literate activities. It is under this new model that children with developmental disabilities and special needs have been considered <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Note that there is limited research regarding reading in special needs, but this article attempts to represent the most current evidence on this topic.|$|R
5|$|While {{the name}} Thuthmose {{had also been}} {{identified}} (but not read) by Young who realized that the first syllable was spelled with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the phonetic spelling of {{the second part of}} the word, and check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone. This finally confirmed to Champollion that the ancient texts as well as the recent ones used the same writing system, and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles.|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding {{at a safe}} house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
