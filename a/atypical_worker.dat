40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} quality of {{atypical}} employment to reveal whether support for the generation of temporary and part-time jobs is an effective policy for labour market renewal or whether it leads to labour market segmentation. This issue is investigated through analyses of {{the quality of}} atypical employment, with the following components of atypical work investigated: working-conditions, wages, poverty risk, exposure to unemployment and/or labour market drop out, as well as the extent to which atypical employment leads to the standard employment contract, termed its 'bridging function'. Strong and consistent variation in the quality of atypical work (relative to standard contract employment) combined with evidence of a weak bridging function is taken as an indicator of labour market marginalisation for these workers. Evidence of labour market marginalisation would suggest that non-standard contracts foster market segmentation. A key component of the analyses asserts that institutional context will structure <b>atypical</b> <b>worker</b> outcome with comparative analysis run on three countries to test this hypothesis. The countries chosen for the analysis varied in their combination of institutions thought to structure labour market outcome. The institutions thought to structure labour market outcome were classified into two groups, or axes, thought to structure labour markets in a different manner. The first group of institutions were thought to influence the relative openness or flexibility of markets, while the second was thought to influence the integration of labour market outsiders. Denmark is presented as a flexibly integrative labour market, the French market is presented as rigidly integrative and the United Kingdom is labelled flexibly non-integrative. The empirical analyses revealed strong and consistent variation in the quality of atypical work (relative to standard contract employment) and while the evidence suggests that temporary employment does provide a bridging function, the same was not true of part- time employment. This led us to conclude that policies which have sought to flexibilise the labour market through the generation of temporary and/or part-time employment are likely to contribute to market segmentation. Nonetheless we established important differences between countries which provided insights into the labour market conditions which were the most supportive of <b>atypical</b> <b>worker</b> inclusion. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{theoretical}} exploration and empirical outlook towards a triptych heretofore not properly investigated: atypical work (e. g., self-employed, agency workers, and workers with a fixed-term contract), participation within the firm, and innovation. How, {{it must be}} asked, can and will <b>atypical</b> <b>workers</b> contribute to innovation through participation within the firm or, from another angle, how can participation within the firm contribute to <b>atypical</b> <b>workers</b> willingness to express innovative behavior? For the answer researchers have to learn far more about two distinct groups of atypical workers: 'external knowledge workers' who are highly educated and explicitly hired for innovation, and 'ordinary atypical workers' who are neither highly educated nor hired for innovational purposes. For two reasons, the focus here is on the latter: we (1) presume and show, in contrast to what many scholars assume, that ordinary <b>atypical</b> <b>workers</b> can contribute to innovation in a direct and positive way, and (2) argue that participation within the firm is the key for these workers potential contribution to innovation...|$|R

Os agentes integram equipes de trabalhadores voltados �� atenção básica em saúde cuja função é transmitir informações sobre higiene e saúde nas comunidades onde atuam, levantar dados sobre incidência de doenças na população e encaminhar os doentes para atendimento na Unidade de Saúde da Família. Para isso devem ser moradores da comunidade, para fazer o elo entre esta e a equipe. Constituem-se num trabalhador atípico, seja pelas características dos contratos de trabalho (temporários, terceirizados, não formalizados), seja pela posse de um capital social como competência exigida, ou seja, uma característica relacional como condição para exercer a ocupação. O trabalho dos agentes reflete as novas formas de implementação de políticas sociais descentralizadas pelo Estado e as novas formas de utilização de trabalhadores, fora do quadro do funcionalismo tradicional. A pesquisa constou de questionário aplicado a 53 Agentes Comunitários de Saúde de doze equipes do Programa de Saúde da Família nos municípios de João Pessoa, Campina Grande, Casserengue e Cacimba de Dentro; entrevistas com lideranças sindicais, enfermeiras e médicos vinculados às equipes, e gestores estaduais e municipais.

40|$|This study, {{part of a}} {{broad and}} ongoing series of {{researches}} conducted by the authors on <b>atypical</b> <b>workers,</b> was aimed to observe the role of skills in influencing organizational well-being and performance of <b>atypical</b> <b>workers.</b> The role of skills, which emerged from previous studies conducted using qualitative methodologies, {{is of particular interest}} for its implied possible applications and its results on an a productivity and organizational efficiency level. In fact, skills training is a field of high interest for psychological and economical sciences. The concept of skills being related both to well-being and performance can place them in a pivotal position in the perspective of the advantage of organizations and employees. In fact, programs of skills training tend to be well accepted by employers more easily than interventions aiming solely to well-being, as they are perceived to bring advantages for the organization in terms of performance. Specifically, this study aimed to test the scales for measuring a set of skills of adult workers and a model of skills based on five factors; identify the role of skills in influencing organizational well-being and performance; observe the role of the type of contract on skills, organizational well-being, and performance. This study involved a group of 100 workers employed in a public service organization. They completed an instrument specifically tailored for this survey. A five components model for skills, namely “Action skills” (AS), “Thinking skills”(TS), “Interpersonal skills” (IS), “Interpreting skills” (IntS), and “Self-management skills” (SMS), was at the basis of this instrument. ANOVA and regression analyses were conducted on the various dimensions contained in the instruments. Analyses conducted through exploratory factor equation models were applied on the five factor model of skills, proving it to be satisfactory. ANOVA analyses, conducted to check the effects of the type of contract on perceived performance, showed that there are interactions between them. ANOVA analyses were also conducted to check the effects of the type of contract – atypical vs. traditional – on perceived skills possessed. They showed the existence of an interaction between the type of contract and the perception of skills by the participants of the research. Regression analyses were conducted to investigate the moderating effects of skills on organizational well-being variables. The stepwise procedure used for data analysis gave rise to a model identifying specific skills as predictors of variables of organizational well-being and, consequently, individual performance and organizational productivity. After some further research, a model of organizational training with the side (or main) effect of increasing well-being together with performance can be eventually perfected, particularly in regard to <b>atypical</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

The path analysis for the ‘gap in job satisfaction’ (GiJS) before and after the global financial crisis shows that there are significant differences in the GiJS among respondents, which can be attributed to several factors: most importantly, type of work, followed by educational level, and, finally, monthly income. Gender has less effect on the GiJS than other variables; however, it does affect the GiJS insofar as it influences type of work and monthly income.

Increases in non-agricultural selfemployment in industrialised countries, together with political and ideological shifts, have fuelled interest in self-employment {{as a means of}} increasing employment. The attractions of selfemployment are manifold. To firms, self-employment is part of a two-fold change in the way firms operate: the move towards more flexibility as to the size and composition of the workforce, marked by an increased use of <b>atypical</b> <b>workers</b> and the disintegration of firms by arranging production through outsourcing, subcontracting and franchising. To workers, self-employment offers the greater autonomy connected with being their own boss, a chance of higher returns, or, at least, opportunities of gainful employment in times of high unemployment.

Following the 2008 economic crisis, three business trends have emerged in the UK-First, there {{is an increase in}} outsourcing activities.

Risk-externalities are the risks which businesses pass onto others in the attempt to reduce costs and burdens. Some businesses profit in this kind of environment. However, there are instances of adversities particular in the low-skilled labour sector where workers, especially women, are vulnerable to such externalities. These individuals are in the atypical workforce which is composed of zero-hours workers, fixed-term workers and agency workers.

Globalization and innovation are highlighted as the forces that increase the volatility of firm performance, which in turn increases the demand for flexible labor forces. According to the job flow analysis, jobs of temporary and contract workers are more unstable compared with part-time jobs. The results suggest that temporary workers are not necessarily substitutes for regular fulltime jobs, but rather that temporary workers are the substitutes for part-time, casual or contract jobs. After controlling for various firm characteristics, the volatility of a firm's sales growth is a significant determinant of the ratio of atypical employees. This relationship is stronger for manufacturing firms. Among the highly volatile firms, the ratio of atypical employees has a strong positive relationship with productivity. These results suggest that the desirable policy-mix for the economy is the combination of 1) the provision of a sufficient safety-net and training opportunities for <b>atypical</b> <b>workers,</b> and 2) enabling firms to adjust labor input flexibly. ...|$|R
