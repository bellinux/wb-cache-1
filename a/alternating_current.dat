5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to {{participate}} in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{had four}} Curtiss-AEG main and two {{auxiliary}} turbo generators with each driving two dynamos, one each for <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> and direct current. Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had {{a capacity of}} 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E

25|$|The {{impedance}} is {{a measure}} of the ability of the capacitor to pass <b>alternating</b> <b>currents.</b> The lower the impedance, the more easily <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> can be passed through the capacitor.

5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with <b>alternating</b> <b>current.</b> A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400kilowatts, {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450volts on an <b>alternating</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage <b>alternating</b> <b>current,</b> the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as <b>alternating</b> <b>current,</b> can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>current,</b> {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a {{frustrating}} period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on <b>alternating</b> <b>current,</b> a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid.
