5000|$|Copper <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> is {{also used}} for {{production}} of copper chromite. It is generally utilized {{as an alternative to}} the route of barium <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> for usage in chemicals reactive with barium. This can also be washed with acetic acid and dried to remove impurities. Copper chromite is produced through the exposure of copper <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> to temperatures of 350-450 °C: ...|$|E
5000|$|Copper barium <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used substance for production of copper chromite. The resulting copper chromite mixture produced by this method can only be used in procedures that contain materials inert to barium, as barium {{is a product of the}} decomposition of copper barium <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate,</b> and is thus present in the resulting mixture. The by-product copper oxide is removed using an acetic acid extraction, consisting of washing with the acid, decantation and then heat drying of the remaining solid to yield isolated copper chromite. Copper chromite is produced by the exposure of copper barium <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> to temperatures of 350-450 °C, generally by a muffle furnace: ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{active copper}} {{chromite}} catalyst which includes barium in its structure {{can be prepared}} from a solution containing barium nitrate, copper(II) nitrate, and <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate.</b> When these compounds are mixed a resulting precipitate is formed. This solid product is then calcined at 350-400 °C to yield the catalyst: ...|$|E
50|$|Zinc {{is rarely}} anodized, but a process was {{developed}} by the International Lead Zinc Research Organization and covered by MIL-A-81801. A solution of <b>ammonium</b> phosphate, <b>chromate</b> and fluoride with voltages of up to 200 V can produce olive green coatings up to 80 μm thick. The coatings are hard and corrosion resistant.|$|R
40|$|LPPS method (Liquid {{precursor}} plasma spraying) {{was performed}} using aqueous solutions of <b>ammonium</b> vanadate and <b>chromate</b> {{in order to}} přepade nano-crystalline ceramic coatings on steel and ceramic substrates. Their structure was studied and verified by injecting at different conditions the liquid precursors into the stream of water stabilized plasma. The surface coverage of nano-coatings is inversely proportional to the concentration of precursor and largely depends on the geometric arrangement of the depositing device {{in which there is}} a complex process multistage precursor processing within milliseconds...|$|R
40|$|In this {{criteria}} document, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{reviews the}} critical health effects studies of hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) compounds {{in order to}} update its assessment of the potential health effects of occupational exposure to Cr(VI) compounds and its recommendations to prevent and control these workplace exposures. NIOSH reviews the following aspects of workplace exposure to Cr(VI) compounds: the potential for exposures (Chapter 2), analytical methods and considerations (Chapter 3), human health effects (Chapter 4), experimental studies (Chapter 5), and quantitative risk assessments (Chapter 6). Based on evaluation of this information, NIOSH provides recommendations for a revised recommended exposure limit (REL) for Cr(VI) compounds (Chapter 7) and other recommendations for risk management (Chapter 8). This criteria document supersedes previous NIOSH Cr(VI) policy statements, including the 1975 NIOSH Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Exposure to Chromium(VI) and NIOSH Testimony to OSHA on the Proposed Rule on Occupational Exposure to Hexavalent Chromium [NIOSH 1975 a, 2005 a]. Key information in this document, including the NIOSH site visits and the NIOSH quantitative risk assessment, were previously submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and were publicly available during the OSHA Cr(VI) rule-making process. OSHA published its final standard for Cr(VI) compounds in 2006 [71 Fed. Reg. 10099 (2006) ]. Cr(VI) compounds include {{a large group of}} chemicals with varying chemical properties, uses, and workplace exposures. Their properties include corrosion-resistance, durability, and hardness. Workers may be exposed to airborne Cr(VI) when these compounds are manufactured from other forms of Cr (e. g., the production of chromates from chromite ore); when products containing Cr(VI) are used to manufacture other products (e. g., chromate-containing paints, electroplating); or when products containing other forms of Cr are used in processes that result in the formation of Cr(VI) as a by-product (e. g., welding). In the marketplace, the most prevalent materials that contain chromium are chromite ore, chromium chemicals, ferroalloys, and metal. Sodium dichromate is the most common chromium chemical from which other Cr(VI) compounds may be produced. Cr(VI) compounds commonly manufactured include sodium dichromate, sodium chromate, potassium dichromate, potassium <b>chromate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> dichromate, and Cr(VI) oxide. Other manufactured materials containing Cr(VI) include various paint and primer pigments, graphic arts supplies, fungicides, and corrosion inhibitors. An estimated 558, 000 U. S. workers are exposed to airborne Cr(VI) compounds in the workplace. Some of the industries in which the largest numbers of workers are exposed to high concentrations of airborne Cr(VI) compounds include electroplating, welding, and painting. An estimated 1, 045, 500 U. S. workers have dermal exposure to Cr(VI) in cement, primarily in the construction industry. CurrentPrevention and ControlEnvironmental Healt...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> is a salt {{with the}} formula (NH4)2CrO4. It forms yellow, monoclinic crystals; made from {{ammonium}} hydroxide and ammonium dichromate; used in photography as a sensitizer for gelatin coatings. It's {{often used in}} photography, textile printing, and fixing chromate dyes on wool. It is also used as an analytical reagent, catalyst, and corrosion inhibitor. It is soluble in water, and, when applied, can cause irritation in the mucous membrane, eyes, respiratory tract, skin, etc. It may cause skin sensitization after prolonged contact. It is also known to be carcinogenic (cancer-causing), and it can cause tissue ulceration and injury to the liver and kidneys.|$|E
5000|$|Early in the 1910s, several {{printers}} {{experimenting with}} photo-reactive chemicals used the well-known actinic light-activated cross linking or hardening traits of potassium, sodium or <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate</b> and dichromate chemicals with glues and gelatin compounds. Roy Beck, Charles Peter and Edward Owens studied and experimented with chromic acid salt sensitized emulsions for photo-reactive stencils. This trio of developers {{would prove to}} revolutionize the commercial screen printing industry by introducing photo-imaged stencils to the industry, though the acceptance of this method would take many years. Commercial screen printing now uses sensitizers far safer and less toxic than bichromates. Currently there are large selections of pre-sensitized and [...] "user mixed" [...] sensitized emulsion chemicals for creating photo-reactive stencils.|$|E

40|$|Chromium-saponite {{catalysts}} {{have been}} prepared by two synthesis procedures. The first method consisted in the intercalation of the saponite with solutions containing aluminium and chromium oligomers with various molar ratios, while the second one consisted in the incipient wetness impregnation of alumina-pillared saponite with several chromium salts, <b>ammonium</b> <b>chromate,</b> Cr(II) acetate and Cr(III) nitrate. Several techniques, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption at - 196 °C, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, infrared and DR-UV-vis spectroscopies, temperature-programmed reduction and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at - 196 °C, {{have been used to}} characterize and to compare the properties of the materials synthesized. The results show that the solids obtained combine the layered structure of the clay and the thermal stability given by the alumina pillars. The catalysts have been tested in the oxidation of propene, showing a catalytic behaviour according to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the performance not depending on the method in which chromium was incorporated to the clay. © 2007 Elsevier B.
