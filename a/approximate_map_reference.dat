40|$|Precise {{corrections}} of Landsat {{data are}} useful for generating land-use maps, detecting various crops and determining their acreage, and detecting changes. The paper discusses computer processing and visualization techniques for Landsat data so that users can get more information from the imagery. The elementary unit of data in each band of each scene is the integrated value of intensity of reflected light detected {{in the field of}} view by each sensor. To develop the basic mathematical approach for precision correction of the data, differences between positions of ground control points on the <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> and the observed control points in the scene are used to evaluate the coefficients of cubic time functions of roll, pitch, and yaw, and a linear time function of altitude deviation from normal height above local earth's surface. The resultant equation, termed a mapping function, corrects the warped data image into one that <b>approximates</b> the <b>reference</b> <b>map.</b> Applications are discussed relative to shade prints, extraction of road features, and atlas of cities...|$|R

In this paper, we describe and compare {{the performance of a}} computationally complex exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder [6], [7], its ecient approximation [6], [7], an alternative <b>approximate</b> <b>MAP</b> decoder [1], and an im-proved version of this decoder suggested here.
