50|$|This {{terminology}} {{has been}} the source of much confusion, <b>as</b> it <b>has</b> proven inadequate at describing real-life NAT behavior. Many NAT implementations combine these types, and it is, therefore, better to refer to specific individual NAT behaviors instead of using the Cone/Symmetric terminology. RFC 4787 attempts to alleviate this issue by introducing standardized terminology for observed behaviors. For the first bullet in each row of the above table, the RFC would characterize Full-Cone, Restricted-Cone, and Port-Restricted Cone NATs <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> Endpoint-Independent Mapping, whereas it would characterize <b>a</b> Symmetric NAT <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> Address- and Port-Dependent Mapping. For the second bullet in each row of the above table, RFC 4787 would also label Full-Cone NAT <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> Endpoint-Independent Filtering, Restricted-Cone NAT <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> Address-Dependent Filtering, Port-Restricted Cone NAT <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> Address and Port-Dependent Filtering, and Symmetric NAT <b>as</b> <b>having</b> either <b>an</b> Address-Dependent Filtering or Address and Port-Dependent Filtering. There are other classifications of NAT behavior mentioned, such as whether they preserve ports, when and how mappings are refreshed, whether external mappings can be used by internal hosts (i.e., its Hairpinning behavior), and the level of determinism NATs exhibit when applying all these rules.|$|R
5000|$|Impervious {{surfaces}} are mainly artificial structures—such as pavements (roads, sidewalks, driveways and parking lots , {{as well as}} industrial areas such as airports, ports and logistics and distribution centres, all of which use considerable paved areas) that are covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, stone—and rooftops. Soils compacted by urban development are also highly impervious.

5|$|Although at {{an unusual}} latitude, the storm {{maintained}} this intensity {{for over a}} day before weakening to a tropical storm. During the afternoon of August13, the small system re-intensified into a hurricane. Reconnaissance reported that gale-force winds extended no more than 100mi (155km) from the storm's eye. Shortly thereafter, the system further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 105mph (160km/h). Weather maps at the time depicted the storm <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> minimum pressure of 987mbar (hPa). By August14, the storm began to weaken once more, gradually becoming a tropical storm on August15. After tunrning northward, the cyclone became extratropical at a high latitude of 39.8°N.|$|E
