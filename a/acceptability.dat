5|$|Funded {{in part by}} {{assessments}} {{on commercial}} properties, in 2009 Ambassadors of the Minneapolis Downtown Improvement District (DID) began working on 120 blocks of downtown to improve its cleanliness, friendliness and <b>acceptability</b> of behavior. They are employees of Block by Block, a company in Nashville, Tennessee that serves 46 U.S. cities.|$|E
5|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} one of Hitchcock's best films and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars. Often ranked among the greatest films of all time, it set {{a new level of}} <b>acceptability</b> for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films, and is widely considered to be the earliest example of the slasher film genre.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to <b>acceptability</b> of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} <b>acceptability</b> is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical <b>acceptability</b> of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social <b>acceptability.</b> There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political <b>acceptability</b> of the congestion charge.|$|E
5|$|This section covers {{compliance}} with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure <b>acceptability,</b> and that after acceptance, the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social <b>acceptability</b> of {{altering}} identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the past}} twenty years however, there has been a major shift in linguists' {{understanding}} of intermediate levels of <b>acceptability.</b> This is due to the increasing use of experimental methods to measure <b>acceptability,</b> making it possible to detect subtle differences along a scale of <b>acceptability.</b> Keller (2000) and Fanselow et al. (2004) are two proponents of this new way to construe grammaticality.|$|E
25|$|Speakers' judgements of the well-formedness of {{sentences}} form a continuous spectrum. While many grammaticality judgements are categorical, with a given sentence judged as either 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', {{there are many}} sentences that fall in a grey area of partial <b>acceptability.</b> According to Jon Sprouse (2007), the difference between grammaticality and <b>acceptability</b> is that grammatical knowledge is categorical, but <b>acceptability</b> is a gradient scale.|$|E
25|$|The <b>acceptability</b> of a {{sentence}} is often reported {{in a variety of}} terms including acceptable, marginally acceptable, unacceptable, terrible, good etc. Degrees of <b>acceptability</b> are usually represented by symbols like *, ?,??, ?* etc., usually on a scale of 0-?-*-** (acceptable to unacceptable).|$|E
25|$|Humane {{orientation}} is {{negatively associated with}} the <b>acceptability</b> of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).|$|E
25|$|Social <b>acceptability</b> {{was vital}} for the sangha, {{as it could}} not survive without {{material}} support from lay society.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acceptability</b> {{is about}} the {{performance}} of speakers, that is, the actual use of their language in concrete situations. As stressed by Chomsky, <b>acceptability</b> does not mean grammaticality: while an acceptable sentence must be grammatical, a grammatical sentence {{does not need to}} be acceptable. For a sentence to be judged acceptable, it must also appear natural and appropriate in a given context, be easily understood and, possibly, be to a certain extent conventionalised.|$|E
25|$|Social/Cultural <b>acceptability</b> — {{the extent}} to which the policy action may be opposed by current social norms or {{cultural}} values.|$|E
25|$|That the {{relative}} <b>acceptability</b> of (11c) {{is related to}} a frequency affect is confirmed {{by the fact that}} ordinarily such sentences are judged to be ungrammatical, as shown in (12).|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram {{are the best}} in terms of efficacy and <b>acceptability</b> in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar MDD. Reboxetine was significantly worse.|$|E
25|$|Attitudes in Western {{cultures}} {{are not all}} the same as explained above, and likewise attitudes in non-Western {{cultures are}} many and variant. In almost all cultures, <b>acceptability</b> of nudity depends on the situation.|$|E
25|$|The British {{settlements}} in Western India, South India, and the Eastern Province of Bengal (Calcutta) independently developed different coinages in consonance {{with the local}} <b>acceptability</b> of the coins {{for the purposes of}} trade.|$|E
25|$|Lucas, {{who grew}} up in the Soviet Union and {{experienced}} its antisemitism, was on a panel at The New School on the state of gay rights and <b>acceptability</b> in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|René {{continued}} to feature vaginas prominently in his artwork — aware it may negatively affect sales and, therefore, gallery interest — even as other artists have achieved broader <b>acceptability</b> by painting euphemistic representations.|$|E
25|$|By {{contrast}} GSCP data starts {{either with}} an OFFICIAL OR SECRET classification {{depending on the}} nature of threat and its <b>acceptability</b> to the business, and thereafter moves up or down accordingly based on consequence of compromise.|$|E
25|$|Technology. All outside {{equipment}} must {{be selected}} with careful consideration {{given to the}} local finance available for maintenance and replacement. Cultural <b>acceptability</b> and the local capacity to maintain equipment and buy spare parts are vital.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{one should}} keep in mind when {{assessing}} a computer system that other aspects of performance (errors, learning, functionality, recall, concentration, fatigue, and <b>acceptability),</b> types of users (novice, casual) and non-routine tasks have to be considered as well.|$|E
25|$|The INDICARE {{project is}} an ongoing {{dialogue}} on consumer <b>acceptability</b> of DRM solutions in Europe. It is an open and neutral platform for exchange of facts and opinions, mainly based on articles by authors from science and practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{influential}} Shafi'i {{chief judge}} of Damascus Taqi al-Din al-Subki condemned Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, on the <b>acceptability</b> of the triple divorce and {{on account of}} his view permitting the conduct of horse races without the participation of a third competitor.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the old model it replaces {{however, the}} GSCP does not {{consider}} the consequence of a compromise as the primary factor, but instead {{is based on the}} capability and motivation of potential threat actors (attackers) and the <b>acceptability</b> of that risk to the business.|$|E
25|$|In other countries, {{residential}} use of fluorescent lighting {{varies depending on}} the price of energy, financial and environmental concerns of the local population, and <b>acceptability</b> of the light output. In East and Southeast Asia it is very rare to see incandescent bulbs in buildings anywhere.|$|E
25|$|Performance {{orientation}} is {{positively associated with}} the acceptance of bullying. Future {{orientation is}} negatively associated with the <b>acceptability</b> of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals {{who live and work}} in this kind of culture tend to value interpersonal relationships to a greater degree.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} is that terms chosen by an {{identity}} group, as acceptable descriptors of themselves, {{can be used in}} negative ways by detractors. This compromises the integrity of the language and turns what was intended to be positive into negative or vice versa, thus often devaluing <b>acceptability,</b> meaning and use.|$|E
25|$|The {{method in}} which the Barnum {{personality}} profiles are presented can affect {{the extent to which}} people accept them as their own. For instance, Barnum profiles that are more personalized—perhaps containing a specific person's name—are more likely to yield higher <b>acceptability</b> ratings than those that could be applied to anyone.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} clozapine, however, is, at least, {{in the short}} term, not {{reflected}} in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The relapse rate is lower and patient <b>acceptability</b> is better. There is some evidence clozapine may reduce propensity for substance abuse in schizophrenic patients.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{difference}} suggested, {{relates to}} the <b>acceptability</b> of moderation within Jewish law. Both Modern Orthodoxy and Ultra Orthodoxy regard Halakha as divine in origin, and as such, no position is assumed without justification in the Shulchan Aruch and in the Acharonim. The movements differ, however, in their approach to strictures (chumras) and leniencies (kulas).|$|E
25|$|Newton had {{previously}} invented the calculus, of mathematics, {{and used it}} to perform the mathematical calculations. For <b>acceptability,</b> his book, the Principia, was formulated entirely in terms of the long-established geometric methods, which were soon eclipsed by his calculus. However, it was Leibniz who developed the notation of the derivative and integral preferred today.|$|E
25|$|Cost of acceptance. Coins can {{be checked}} for {{authenticity}} by weighing {{and other forms}} of examination and testing. These costs can be significant, but good quality coin design and manufacturing can help reduce these costs. Banknotes also have an acceptance cost, the costs of checking the banknote's security features and confirming <b>acceptability</b> of the issuing bank.|$|E
