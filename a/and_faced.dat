40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to collate, compare, and discuss the presently available data for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> dimensions among Korean and Japanese ethnic groups. Classification of Korean male and female head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> types is simpler than classification of Japanese subjects. Male groups have more statistically significant morphological differences than females, and Japanese subjects display larger values for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> measurement categories than Korean subjects. Japanese item values for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> dimensions show distinct differences between male and female subjects compared to Korean subjects. Japanese male subjects have distinct differences from Korean male subjects and relatively lower values for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> dimensions as age increases compared to Korean male subjects.

40|$|Abstract: Most {{biometric}} {{systems that}} are presently used in real time applications typically use a single biometric characteristic to authenticate the user. A biometric system which is based only on a single biometric identifier in making a personal identification is often not {{able to meet the}} desired performance requirements. Multimodal biometrics is an emerging field of biometric technology, where more than one biometric trait to improve the combined performance. We design a bimodal biometric system which integrates FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face.</b> Hence this paper has focused on the extraction of features from FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and the key points are derived from FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> <b>and</b> then they are clustered using K-Means Algorithm. The centroid, mean and variance of key extracted image of K-Means are stored in the database which is compared with the query FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> features to prove the recognition and authentication. The comparison is based on the XOR operation. Results are performed on the Poly-U FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> database to check the proposed FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> recognition method. It can be used to overcome some of the limitations of a single biometrics, increases the performance...|$|R

40|$|Holistic {{processing}} <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding {{are widely}} considered primary perceptual mechanisms behind good face recognition. Here, however, we present {{the case of}} S. P., a developmental prosopagnosic who demonstrated severe impairments in <b>face</b> memory <b>and</b> <b>face</b> perception, yet showed normal holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding. Across three composite experiments, S. P. showed normal-strength holistic processing for upright <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> no composite effect for inverted faces. Across five aftereffect experiments, S. P. showed normal-sized face aftereffects, which derived normally from face space rather than shape-generic mechanisms. The case of S. P. implies: (a) normal holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding can be insufficient for good face recognition even when present in combination; and (b) the focus of recent literature on holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space should be expanded to include other potential face processing mechanisms (e. g., part-based processing).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to define a {{standard}} interface for storing and retrieving novel, non-traditional partial differential equation (PDE) discretizations. Although it focuses specifically on finite elements where state is associated with edges <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> of volumetric elements rather than nodes and the elements themselves (as implemented in ALEGRA), the proposed interface should be general enough to accommodate most discretizations, including hp-adaptive finite elements and even mimetic techniques that define fields over arbitrary polyhedra. This report reviews the representation of edge <b>and</b> <b>face</b> elements as implemented by ALEGRA. It then specifies a convention for storing these elements in EXODUS files by extending the EXODUS API to include edge <b>and</b> <b>face</b> blocks in addition to element blocks. Finally, it presents several techniques for rendering edge <b>and</b> <b>face</b> elements using VTK and ParaView, {{including the use of}} VTK's generic dataset interface for interpolating values interior to edges <b>and</b> <b>faces...</b>|$|R
