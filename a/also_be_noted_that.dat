5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire.

Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that,</b> in {{personality}} and mental setup, Vimes bears some similarity to Granny Weatherwax.
