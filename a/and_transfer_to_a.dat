500|$|Incarcerated in a {{military}} hospital, he was repeatedly interrogated by his German captors, who believed that the British were using expanding bullets in contravention of the 1899 Hague Convention. Horrocks' captors refused to change his clothes or sheets, and denied him and a fellow officer basic amenities. Both had temporarily lost {{the use of their}} legs, and were forced to crawl to the toilet, which caused Horrocks' wounds to become infected. Conditions improved after his discharge <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prisoner of war camp. On his way to the camp, Horrocks befriended his German escort—he attributed their rapport to the mutual respect that front-line troops share. [...] He was promoted to lieutenant on 18 December 1914, despite being in enemy hands, and often tried to escape, once coming within [...] of the Dutch border before being recaptured. He was eventually placed in a compound for Russian officers, {{in the hope that the}} language barrier would hinder his escape attempts; Horrocks used the time to learn the Russian language. Years later, working in the House of Commons, he surprised Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin by greeting them in their native tongue. In the latter part of the war he was held in Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp. His resistance in captivity would earn him the Military Cross (MC), awarded in 1920 and backdated to 5 May 1919.|$|E

Opposed to Abraham Lincoln's election, Oates cautioned against precipitate secession; however, once Alabama decided to leave the Union, he threw himself wholeheartedly into the Southern cause, raising a company of volunteers that became Co. [...] "G" [...] of the 15th Alabama. After Cantey's promotion <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new position, Oates assumed command of the regiment as a whole.
