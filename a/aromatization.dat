25|$|The major {{effect of}} estrogenicity is {{gynecomastia}} (woman-like breasts). AAS {{that have a}} high potential for <b>aromatization</b> like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show {{a high risk of}} gynecomastia, while AAS that have a reduced potential for <b>aromatization</b> like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is a {{steroid hormone}} {{produced}} by <b>aromatization</b> of testosterone. Estradiol {{is the principal}} human estrogen and acts on estrogen receptors throughout the body. The largest amounts of estradiol are produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries, but lesser amounts are derived from testicular and adrenal testosterone.|$|E
25|$|During the {{reproductive}} years, most estradiol in women {{is produced by}} the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the <b>aromatization</b> of Δ4-androstenedione (produced in the theca folliculi cells) to estrone, followed by conversion of estrone to estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.|$|E
25|$|Catalytic {{amounts of}} aqueous CAN allow the {{efficient}} synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives. Quinoxalines {{are known for}} their applications as dyes, organic semiconductors, and DNA cleaving agents. These derivatives are also components in antibiotics such as echinomycin and actinomycin.

25|$|For {{aromatic}} substrates, {{the first}} bond is hardest to hydrogenate {{because of the}} free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system. The product {{of this is a}} cyclohexadiene, which is extremely active and cannot be isolated; in conditions reducing enough to break the <b>aromatization,</b> it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene. The cyclohexene is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane, but special modifications to the catalysts (such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium) can preserve some of the cyclohexene, if that is a desired product.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Aromatization</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which an}} aromatic system is formed. [...] It can also refer {{to the production of}} a new aromatic moiety in a molecule which is already aromatic. [...] Theoretically, this can be achieved by dehydrogenation of existing cyclic compounds (such as in converting cyclohexane into benzene) or by formation of new cyclic system (such as in the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene); practically, other moieties are typically required to carry out such conversion, and other approaches like applying condensation reactions are possible. [...] <b>Aromatization</b> includes the formation of any aromatic system (including heterocyclic systems), and is not restricted to benzene and its derivatives.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bones and}} the brain are two {{important}} tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of <b>aromatization</b> to estradiol. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the epiphyses and conclusion of growth. In the central nervous system, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol. Estradiol rather than testosterone serves {{as the most important}} feedback signal to the hypothalamus (especially affecting LH secretion). In many mammals, prenatal or perinatal [...] "masculinization" [...] of the sexually dimorphic areas of the brain by estradiol derived from testosterone programs later male sexual behavior.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the sake}} of clarification, {{it should be noted}} that the term [...] "anabolic–androgenic steroid" [...] is {{essentially}} synonymous with [...] "androgen" [...] (or with [...] "anabolic steroid"), and that natural androgens like testosterone are also AAS. These drugs all share the same core mechanism of action of acting as agonists of the AR and have similar effects, although their potency, pharmacokinetics, oral activity, ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects (due to differing capacities to be locally metabolized and potentiated by 5α-reductase), capacity for <b>aromatization</b> (i.e., conversion into an estrogen), and potential for liver damage may all differ.|$|E
2500|$|Early infancy {{androgen}} {{effects are}} the least understood. [...] In the first weeks of life for male infants, testosterone levels rise. The levels remain in a pubertal range for a few months, but usually reach the barely detectable levels of childhood by 4–6 months of age. The function of this rise in humans is unknown. It has been speculated that [...] "brain masculinization" [...] is occurring since no significant changes {{have been identified in}} other parts of the body. The male brain is masculinized by the <b>aromatization</b> of testosterone into estrogen, which crosses the blood–brain barrier and enters the male brain, whereas female fetuses have α-fetoprotein, which binds the estrogen so that female brains are not affected.|$|E
2500|$|As an AAS, {{methyltestosterone}} is an agonist of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, {{and so is}} potentiated analogously in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient <b>aromatization</b> into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. The drug possesses negligible progestogenic activity.|$|E
2500|$|While the decaketide {{is still}} {{associated}} with the KS/CLF heterodimer the 9-carbonyl group is reduced by Dps E, the 9-ketoreductase, using NADPH as the reducing agent/hydride donor. [...] Dps F, the “1st ring cyclase” /aromatase, is very specific {{and is in the}} family of C-7/C-12 cyclases that require prior C-9 keto-reduction. [...] These two reactions are felt to occur while the polyketide chain is still partially in the KS/CLF tunnel and it is not known what finally cleaves the chain from its covalent link to the KS or ACP. If the Dps F cyclase is inactivated by mutations or gene deletions, the chain will cyclize spontaneously in random fashion. Thus, Dps F is thought to “chaperone” or help fold the polyketide to ensure non-random cyclization, a reaction that is energetically favorable and leads to subsequent dehydration and resultant <b>aromatization.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, American {{gynecologist}} John Morris {{provided the}} first full description {{of what he called}} [...] "testicular feminization syndrome" [...] based on 82 cases compiled from the medical literature, including two of his own patients. [...] The term [...] "testicular feminization" [...] was coined to reflect Morris' observation that the testicles in these patients produced a hormone that had a feminizing effect on the body, a phenomenon now understood to be due to the inaction of androgens, and subsequent <b>aromatization</b> of testosterone into estrogen. [...] A few years before Morris published his landmark paper, Lawson Wilkins had shown through his own experiments that unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones was a cause of [...] "male pseudohermaphroditism".

2500|$|Many <b>aromatization</b> {{processes}} {{start with}} two or three acyclic molecules which are fused into a new aromatic ring. Alkyne trimerization is one simple case whereby the [...] cycloaddition of three alkynes yields a substituted benzene [...] cyclization of 2-butyne forming hexamethylbenzene, for example. Benzene itself can be prepared by Reppe synthesis with the ligands on the nickel catalyst dictating whether production of benzene or cyclooctatetraene predominates. [...] If an unsymmetric alkyne is used, a variety of products is formed; Rhodium-catalysed cyclotrimerization of phenylacetylene yields both the 1,2,4- and 1,3,5- isomers of triphenylbenzene along with substantial quantities of acyclic enyne products, though use of an alternative catalyst system can produce 97% selectivity for the 1,2,4-product. Antiaromatic cyclobutadiene-derivatives and non-aromatic cyclooctatetraene products are also observed side-products of cyclotrimerizations, and when a mixture of substituted acetylenes is used regioselectivity becomes especially problematic.

2500|$|Historic {{interest}} in benzene {{arose from the}} uncertainty over its structure and reactivity. [...] It was well established {{that it had a}} carbon to hydrogen ratio of 1:1 which suggested the presence of double or triple bond carbon-to-carbon bonds, yet such unsaturated compounds typically undergo addition reactions, which benzene does not. [...] Numerous potential structures were proposed, including by Claus, Dewar, Ladenburg, Armstrong, and Thiele. [...] The most influential proposal was that of Kekulé who in 1865 suggested a cyclic structure of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds [...] Kekulé based his argument on the now well-known observations of arene substitution patterns, namely that there are always only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene and three isomers of every disubstituted derivative. [...] Critics noted that Kekulé's proposal implied that there should be two distinguishable isomers for an ortho-substitution (a 1,2-disubstituion) depending on whether a single or double bond joined these two carbons. [...] Kekulé suggested in reply that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, which would also explain the lack of addition reactions (as the valency of each carbon atom is not that expected of a double bond). [...] Though this interconversion is incorrect —in fact, they are both resonance contributors to the actual structure (which is closest to Thiele's structure)— the geometry and structure proposed by Kekulé are correct. [...] Benzene is the prototypical example of an aromatic compound, a hitherto unknown class of compounds, and its synthesis was the first example of <b>aromatization,</b> the process and chemical reactions whereby an aromatic system is formed. [...] The new understanding of benzene and all aromatic compounds was so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper; its 150th anniversary was also marked.
