40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the facial symmetry of rats submitted to experimental mandibular condyle fracture and with protein undernutrition (8 % of protein) {{by means of}} cephalometric measurements. METHODS: Forty-five adult Wistar rats were distributed in three groups: fracture group, submitted to condylar fracture with no changes in diet; undernourished fracture group, submitted to hypoproteic diet and condylar fracture; undernourished group, kept {{until the end of}} experiment, without condylar fracture. Displaced fractures of the right condyle were induced under general anesthesia. The specimens were submitted to axial radiographic incidence, and cephalometric mensurations were made using a computer system. The values obtained were subjected to statistical analyses among the groups and between the sides in each group. RESULTS: There was significative decrease of the values of serum proteins and albumin in the undernourished fracture group. There was deviation of the median line <b>of</b> the <b>mandible</b> relative to the median line of the maxilla, significative to undernutrition fracture group, as well as <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> the maxilla and mandible, in special in the final period of experiment.

We studied predation of sinistral and dextral forms of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis (Linnaeus, 1758) by two snail-feeding beetle species, Phosphuga atrata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Carabus granulatus Linnaeus, 1758. We investigated a possible preference for or more efficient predation of prey items with a certain coiling direction. We found that C. granulatus displayed a preference for dextral snails, as opposed to P. atrata, which did not show any preference.

40|$|Craniometaphyseal {{dysplasia}} (CMD) is an osteochondrodysplasia {{of unknown}} etiology characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the craniofacial bones associated with abnormal modeling of the metaphyses. Sclerosis {{of the skull}} may lead to <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandible,</b> {{as well as to}} cranial nerve compression, that finally may result in hearing loss and facial palsy. We have analyzed a large German kindred with autosomal dominant (AD) CMD and found tight linkage between the disorder and microsatellite markers on chromosome 5 p (maximum two-point LOD score 4. 82; theta = 0). Our results clearly establish the existence of a locus for AD CMD on central chromosome 5 p (5 p 15. 2 -p 14. 1). This region overlaps with the mapping interval of the growth hormone-receptor (GHR) gene (5 p 14 -p 12), which is known {{to be involved in the}} mitogenic activation of osteoblasts.

Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of 28 adults with UCLP were analyzed in this study. Segmented three-dimensional temporomandibular fossa and mandible images were reconstructed, and angular, linear, and volumetric parameters were measured. Results: For all 28 individuals, the chin was found to deviate to the cleft side by 1. 59 mm. Moreover, among these 28 individuals, only 7 showed distinct (more than 4 mm) chin deviation, which was toward the cleft side. Compared to the non-cleft side, the mandibular body length, frontal ramal incli nation, and vertical position of the condyle were lower and inclination of the temporomandibular fossa was steeper on the cleft side. Furthermore, the dif ferences in inclination of the temporomandibular fossa, mandibular body length, ramus length, and condylar volume ratio (non-deviated/deviated) were po sitively correlated with chin deviation. Conclusions: UCLP individuals show mild chin deviation to the cleft side. Statistical differences were noted in the parameters that represented positional and morphological <b>asymmetries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandible</b> and temporomandibular fossa; however, these differences were too small to indicate clinical significance.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the condylar and ramal <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandible</b> in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) using orthopantomographies (OPTs). METHODS: A total of 30 JIA patients with confirmed diagnosis of JIA and a routine OPT, seeking for orthodontic therapy, free of specific symptoms of temporomandibular joint involvement, and 30 normal matched subjects with OPT were comprised in the study. The method of Habets et al. was used to compare the condyles and rami in OPT. The significance of between-group differences were assessed using Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The results showed a high significant difference in the range <b>of</b> <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> the condyle, being the patient group highly asymmetrical (P < 0. 0001). No differences were found in the range <b>of</b> <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> the ramus between groups (P = 0. 47). The intra-group comparison between males and females showed a difference in the patient group (P = 0. 04), being the females more asymmetric. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing that the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is highly susceptible to inflammatory alterations during growth, even in absence of symptomatology, and being the OPT a cost-benefit favorable imaging tool widespread in the dental field, the latter could be used as a first screening examination in JIA patients to calculate the condylar asymmetry index. The use of this screening tool will help the physicians in addressing the patients that should undergo a more detailed TMJ imaging to early detect TMJ abnormalities and to early set up a targeted therapy of the related cranial growth alteration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Neurosensory {{disturbance}} is {{a common}} complication of bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). This study focuses on the evaluation of factors affecting neurosensory disturbance after BSSO. Furthermore, the study focuses on the measurement of neurosensory disturbance with easily available bedside tests, not only on evaluating the state of sensory disturbance at each follow-up, but also on predicting the potential for recovery. Moreover, panoramic radiography, computerized tomography (CT) and conventional spiral tomography are assessed on locating the mandibular canal. The study was carried out involving a total of 50 patients undergoing BSSO for the correction of mandibular deficiency. In addition, 20 voluntary healthy students participated in this study. Questionnaires, a battery of neurosensory tests and preoperative imaging of the mandibular canal were used. A high incidence of neurosensory disturbance of the lower lip and chin was found after BSSO. However, recovery of sensation occurred with increasing frequency during the follow-up, and after one year sensation of the lower lip and chin returned to the presurgical situation in most patients. A prolonged neurosensory disturbance was more frequent in older patients, in large surgical movements <b>of</b> the <b>mandible</b> and {{in cases where the}} inferior alveolar nerve was manipulated during surgery. The bedside tests used in this study correlated well with the patients' subjective evaluation of neurosensory disturbance, and the repeatability of these tests was good. Furthermore, the sensibility testing of the mandibular teeth correlated well with the other tests and patient's subjective evaluation. Four days after surgery, sensibility testing of the mandibular teeth was an efficient test alone to predict the recovery from neurosensory disturbance. On radiographic imaging, the risk for neurosensory disturbance after BSSO could not be predicted from the panoramic radiograph. Before BSSO, CT was the best method to visualize the buccolingual location of the mandibular canal. After BSSO, a clinical follow-up using a battery of mechano- and nociceptive tests in the examination of sensation of the lower lip and chin, sensibility testing of the teeth, and subjective evaluation is needed. CT should be a part of treatment planning of the patients with thin rami or severe <b>asymmetries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandible...</b>|$|R

40|$|Facial {{asymmetry}} often persists {{even after}} mandibular deviation corrected by the bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) operation, since the reference facial sagittal plane for the asymmetry analysis is usually set {{up before the}} mandibular menton (Me) point correction. Our aim {{is to develop a}} predictive and quantitative method to assess the true <b>asymmetry</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandible</b> after a midline correction performed by a virtual BSSRO, and to verify its availability by evaluation of the post-surgical improvement. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University (China) of patients with pure hemi-mandibular elongation (HE) from September 2010 through May 2014. Mandibular models were reconstructed from CBCT images of patients with pre-surgical orthodontic treatment. After mandibular de-rotation and midline alignment with virtual BSSRO, the elongation hemi-mandible was virtually mirrored along the facial sagittal plane. The residual asymmetry, defined as the superimposition and boolean operation of the mirrored elongation side on the normal side, was calculated, including the volumetric differences and the length of transversal and vertical asymmetry discrepancy. For more specific evaluation, both sides of the hemi-mandible were divided into the symphysis and parasymphysis (SP), mandibular body (MB), and mandibular angle (MA) regions. Other clinical variables include deviation of Me point, dental midline and molar relationship. The measurement of volumetric discrepancy between the two sides of post-surgical hemi-mandible were also calculated to verify the availability of virtual surgery. Paired t-tests were computed and the P value was set at. 05. This study included 45 patients. The volume differences were 407. 8 ± 64. 8 mm 3, 2139. 1 ± 72. 5 mm 3, and 422. 5 ± 36. 9 mm 3; residual average transversal discrepancy, 1. 9 mm, 1. 0 mm, and 2. 2 mm; average vertical discrepancy, 1. 1 mm, 2. 2 mm, and 2. 2 mm (before virtual surgery). The post-surgical volumetric measurement showed no statistical differences between bilateral mandibular regions. Mandibular asymmetry persists after Me point correction. A 3 D quantification <b>of</b> mandibular residual <b>asymmetry</b> after Me point correction and mandible de-rotation with virtual BSSRO sets up a true reference mirror plane for comprehensive <b>asymmetry</b> assessment <b>of</b> bilateral mandibular structure, thereby providing an accurate guidance for orthognathic surgical planning...|$|R
