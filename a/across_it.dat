5|$|An {{alternate}} pathway of endocytic processing {{had also}} been demonstrated wherein certain proteins like fibrinogen and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC-II molecules after they are denatured and their disulfide bonds are reduced (breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms <b>across</b> <b>it).</b> The proteases then degrade the exposed regions of the protein-MHC II-complex.|$|E

5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Cherry Candles', bred by Bill Molyneux {{from the}} 'Birthday Candles' cultivar, is a compact plant growing to 45cm tall {{and up to}} 100cm across with cherry red-styled gold flowers, darker than its parent, 15cm high by 6cm <b>across.</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} commercially in spring 2004, and granted PBR status in February 2005, after an application by Molyneux.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Golden Cascade' is {{yet another}} plant from the same {{locality}} as 'Birthday Candles'; this is more spreading again, to perhaps 30cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with red-styled gold flowers 15cm high by 6cm <b>across.</b> <b>It</b> is also seen as B.spinulosa 'prostrate'. Propagated by Gondwana Nursery, this {{is a relatively new}} release.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Honey Pots' is a {{form with}} all gold flowers to 20cm high (taller than forms listed above), however {{it is a little}} larger with reports of it growing to 1m high, with odd reports of it getting taller than this, by 1.2m <b>across.</b> <b>It</b> comes from south coast in Victoria, {{propagated}} by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Bus {{services}} are provided to numerous stations. Most bus services provide feeding to the metro system where possible, {{and then do}} not continue into town.

5|$|Mud Creek {{is named}} for its muddiness. An area near it was settled as early as 1772 and several bridges were built <b>across</b> <b>it</b> and its tributaries in the 20th century. The creek is {{designated}} as a warm-water fishery.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses <b>across,</b> <b>it</b> {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E

5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm <b>across.</b> <b>It</b> is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat <b>across</b> <b>it.</b> One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell <b>across</b> <b>it.</b> Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E

The transitional belt running along {{the entire length of}} the state is called the terai and bhabhar area. It has rich forests, cutting <b>across</b> <b>it</b> are innumerable streams which swell into raging torrents during the monsoon.|$|E

For the 2009–10 season, the club's kits are produced by Italian sportswear company, Erreà, and the main shirt sponsor is Cheminées Poujoulat.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Allies (for {{the most}} part Peloponnesian) {{prepared}} to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall <b>across</b> <b>it.</b> As at Thermopylae, to make this an effective strategy required the Allied navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring {{the passage of the}} Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Allies to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis in September, the Allied fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.|$|E
50|$|Achaeopsis spinulosa is {{commonly}} known as the hotlips spider crab because of the vivid red marking around its mouth. It is a small spider crab with relatively long but quite sturdy legs.

5|$|Remains {{assignable}} to Paraceratherium {{have been}} found in early to late Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) formations across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Balkans. Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment <b>across</b> <b>it,</b> but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses, artiodactyls, rodents, beardogs, weasels, hyaenodonts, nimravids and cats.|$|E
5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois. Weston {{attended}} Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating high school in 1974, Weston moved to Rimini, Montana, rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written <b>across</b> <b>it.</b> Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television satellite dish to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story (double) wood porch stretching <b>across</b> <b>it,</b> faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E
