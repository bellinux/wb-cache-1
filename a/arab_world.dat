5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria.

5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, {{and because he}} was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the <b>Arab</b> <b>world.</b> He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders.
