25|$|<b>Autochrome,</b> {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} color process, {{was introduced by}} the Lumière brothers in 1907. <b>Autochrome</b> plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an <b>Autochrome</b> plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing {{the color of the}} subject by the additive method. <b>Autochrome</b> plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|A rare <b>autochrome</b> {{photograph}} of Satie exists that dates from 1911. It was reproduced {{on the cover}} of Robert Orledge's second book on the composer, Satie Remembered (1995), but where this <b>autochrome</b> was found has not been made known.|$|E

25|$|Josef Jindřich Šechtl had a {{wide variety}} of {{interests}} in photography, including portrait photography, photojournalism, documenting changes in the town of Tábor, photography of architecture, film, color photography using the <b>Autochrome</b> process, street photography using an early Leica camera, and fine art photography influenced by photographic pictorialism (including use of the bromoil process).|$|E
25|$|While in Europe, Stieglitz saw {{the first}} {{commercial}} demonstration of the <b>Autochrome</b> Lumière color photography process, and soon he was experimenting with it in Paris with Steichen, Frank Eugene and Alvin Langdon Coburn. He took three of Steichen's Autochromes with him to Munich {{in order to have}} four-color reproductions made for insertion into a future issue of Camera Work.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} year White and Stieglitz {{undertook}} an artistic experiment {{in which they}} jointly created a series of photographs of two models, Mabel Cramer and another known only as Miss Thompson. Stieglitz offered suggestions about posing the models, White focused the camera, and {{one or the other}} of them would snap the shutter. White also developed the negatives and printed the photographs. One of the intentions of the experiment was to try a variety of printing techniques and papers, including platinum, gelatin silver and gum bichromate prints. On a few signed of the prints they signed with a monogram that combined both of their initials. During this collaboration, White learned the <b>Autochrome</b> color process from Stieglitz, who had just returned from Europe with this technical knowledge. White and Stieglitz jointly created at least one <b>Autochrome</b> during this time, which they exhibited later in the year.|$|E
50|$|Clatworthy {{began to}} produce <b>Autochromes,</b> the format {{for which he}} would become internationally known, in 1914. In {{exchange}} for image use rights to Clatworthy's <b>Autochromes,</b> railways and transportation companies began to send him on all-expenses-paid photo assignments to various locations. By {{the end of his}} career, Clatworthy counted the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad,the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the Northern Pacific Railway, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, and the Union Pacific Railroad among his clients. While Clatworthy mostly worked in national parks throughout the American West, he also traveled outside of the continental United States to shoot <b>Autochromes.</b> For instance, the Matson Lines sent Clatworthy to Hawaii in 1926; the Union Steamship Company and Matson Lines sent Clatworthy on a tour of Polynesia that included stops in New Zealand, Tahiti, the Cook Islands and Hawaii in 1928; and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company sent Clatworthy to Mexico in 1929 and 1930.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{difficult}} to manufacture and relatively expensive, <b>Autochromes</b> were {{relatively easy to}} use and were immensely popular among enthusiastic amateur photographers—at least, among those who could bear the cost and were willing to sacrifice the convenience of hand-held [...] "snapshooting" [...] in black-and-white. <b>Autochromes</b> failed to sustain the initial interest of more serious [...] "artistic" [...] practitioners, largely due to their inflexibility. Not only did the need for diascopes and projectors make them extremely {{difficult to}} publicly exhibit, they allowed {{little in the way of}} the manipulation much loved by aficionados of the then-popular Pictorialist approach.|$|R
50|$|Edis was {{appointed}} an official war artist and photographed British Women's Services and the battlefields of France and Flanders between 1918 and 1919 for the Imperial War Museum. In 1920 she was commissioned to create advertising photographs for the Canadian Pacific Railway and her <b>autochromes</b> {{of this trip}} to Canada {{are believed to be}} some of the earliest colour photographs of that country.|$|R
25|$|One other {{distraction}} {{could have}} been a reason why Stieglitz did not immediately publish The Steerage. While he was still in Paris on the same trip he saw {{for the first time and}} experimented with the new <b>Autochrome</b> Lumière process, the first commercially viable means of capturing images in color. For the next two years he was captivated by color photography, and he did not return to The Steerage and other black-and-white photos until he learned to photograph using this new process.|$|E
2500|$|Prokudin-Gorsky {{was also}} {{acquainted with the}} use of <b>Autochrome</b> color plates, which did not require a special camera or projector. He was one of the favored few the Lumière Brothers {{introduced}} to their new product in 1906, the year before it went into commercial production. <b>Autochrome</b> plates were expensive and not sensitive enough for casual [...] "snapshots" [...] with a hand-held camera, but their use was simple and in expert hands they were capable of producing excellent results. They made color photography truly practical for advanced amateurs and led some pioneering users of color separation cameras to abandon their methods as outmoded, but Prokudin-Gorsky was not won over. No Autochromes by Prokudin-Gorsky are known to survive.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Steichen began {{experimenting with}} color photography. He {{was one of}} the first people in the United States to use the <b>Autochrome</b> Lumière process. In 1905, Stieglitz and Steichen created the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, which {{eventually}} became known as 291 after its address. [...] It presented among the first American exhibitions of Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, and Constantin Brâncuși.|$|E
5000|$|In 1917, Clatworthy {{presented}} <b>Autochromes</b> of Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) before {{members of}} the United States Congress. Held at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., Clatworthy’s exhibition {{was part of an}} effort headed by Colorado senator John F. Shafroth to increase the area of RMNP. The senate passed Shafroth’s bill, which had been stalled for the past year, the day after Clatworthy’s presentation. It was also around this time that Clatworthy became acquainted with the National Geographic Society. Approximately 100 of Clatworthy's <b>Autochromes</b> accompanied photo essays in National Geographic Magazine between 1923 and 1934, and he became one illustration editor Franklin Fisher's go-to Autochromists. The National Geographic articles included: [...] "Western Views in the Land of the Best" [...] (April 1923); [...] "Photographing the Marvels of the West in Colors" [...] (June 1928); [...] "Scenic Glories of Western United States: Autochromes" [...] (August 1929); [...] "Adventures in Color in Mexico's West Coast" [...] (July 1930); [...] "Colorado: Among the Peaks and Parks of the Rockies" [...] (July 1932); [...] "Sunshine Land of Fruits, Flowers and Sport" [...] (November 1934). Finally, this 1917 trip also marked the beginning of Clatworthy’s career as a slide lecturer. For the next 21 years, Clatworthy would spend his off-seasons presenting <b>Autochromes</b> to packed venues throughout the country. Clatwothy’s most notable lecture venues included the Field Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Between Clatworthy’s lectures and published images, his work was seen by over ten million people in over 160 countries.|$|R
50|$|A {{year later}} {{he became a}} {{lecturer}} on pictorial photography at Munich’s Lehr-und Versuchs-anstalt fur Photo graphie und Reproduktions-technik (Teaching and Research Institute for Photography and the Reproductive Processes). At this point, photography rather than painting became his primary interest. He experimented with the new color process of <b>Autochromes,</b> and three of his color prints are exhibited at Alfred Stieglitz’s Photo-Secession Galleries in New York.|$|R
5000|$|Jules Gervais-Courtellemont (1863-1931) was a French {{photographer}} who {{was famous for}} taking color <b>autochromes</b> during World War I. He {{was born in the}} province of Seine-et-Marne, near Paris, but grew up in Algeria, where he developed a passion for the pre-colonial Orient and devoted most of his professional career in search of the exotic. In 1894 converted to Islam prior to making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Images collected in Turkey, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Spain, India, Morocco and China formed the basis for his popular illustrated lectures, which he illustrated with lantern slides. With the outbreak of World War I, Courtellemont returned to his home province to record the war. After the war, Courtellemont began working for an American publication. He eventually became a photographer for National Geographic. In 1911, Courtellemont opened the [...] "Palais de l'autochromie" [...] in Paris, which comprised an exhibition hall, studio, laboratory, and lecture hall with a seating capacity of 250. It was in this hall that Courtellemont would project his <b>autochromes</b> both of the Orient and, after 1914, of the war, particularly the Marne battlefields. These lectures proved to be so popular that Courtellemont issued a twelve-part series later bound in book form called The Battle of Marne and later a four-part series entitled The Battle of Verdun. These are the first books ever published in color on war. Between 1923 and 1925 he wrote a three-volume work entitled La Civilisation - Histoire sociale de l'humanité, illustrated with his photographs. He was a lifelong friend of the novelist, Orientalist and photographer Pierre Loti. While over 5,500 Gervais-Courtellemont <b>autochromes</b> survive in various institutional collections, his work in private hands is quite rare and sought after. Courtellemon died in 1931. His German counterpart is Hans Hildenbrand.|$|R
2500|$|The {{additive}} RGB {{model and}} variants such as orange–green–violet {{were also used}} in the <b>Autochrome</b> Lumière color plates and other screen-plate technologies such as the Joly color screen and the Paget process {{in the early twentieth}} century. Color photography by taking three separate plates was used by other pioneers, such as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in the period 1909 through 1915. [...] Such methods lasted until about 1960 using the expensive and extremely complex tri-color carbro Autotype process.|$|E
2500|$|O'Gorman {{also had}} artistic {{interests}} and {{was known as}} a pioneer of colour photography using the <b>autochrome</b> process, and his photographs feature in exhibitions of early colour photography. [...] From 1930 {{he was a member of}} the Art Workers Guild, and made , linocuts and lacquer work; he also published a book of poetry, Verses Gloomy and Gay in 1933. Sir Geoffrey de Havilland describes him as a [...] "man of great charm and humour, always interesting in discussion".|$|E
2500|$|Steichen {{took the}} {{photograph}} in Mamaroneck, New York near {{the home of}} his friend, art critic Charles Caffin. [...] The photo features a wooded area and pond, with moonlight appearing between the trees and reflecting on the pond. [...] While the print appears to be a color photograph, the first true color photographic process, the <b>autochrome</b> process, was not available until 1907. Steichen created the impression of color by manually applying layers of light-sensitive gums to the paper. Only three known versions of the Pond—Moonlight are still in existence and, {{as a result of the}} hand-layering of the gums, each is unique. In addition to the auctioned print, the other two versions are held in museum collections. The extraordinary sale price of the print is, in part, attributable to its one-of-a-kind character and to its rarity.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the SFP set itself the task of safeguarding historic works. Today it acts as a research centre on the history and development of photography. Since 1997, it has published the twice-yearly journal Études photographiques with articles on prominent photographers and on the history of photography. The association has a valuable historic collection consisting of some 10,000 images and 50,000 negatives (including 5,000 <b>autochromes.</b> There is also a specialist library with 8,000 books and over 650 journals.|$|R
40|$|In May 1921, {{the first}} Salon du Gout Français (SDGF) {{was held in}} Paris at the Palais de Glace. Inaugurated by {{publisher}} Maurice Devriès as an initiative to boost a French economy still suffering {{from the effects of}} WW 1, this exhibition of French luxury commodities, from cars to couture, traded on the country’s historic reputation as the ne plus ultra of taste and style. Trade shows, fairs and expositions were nothing new, but Devriès’ innovation was to display the exhibits virtually, as images produced by <b>autochromes,</b> a colour photographic process invented by the Lumière brothers and launched by them in 1907. The large glass positive plates, when mounted in back-lit vitrines, glowed with translucent colours (one visitor compared them to stained glass windows), producing a magical effect that enraptured visitors to the Paris Salon and those in North America when they were exhibited at the Egyptian Hall at Wanamakers’ Department Store in Philadelphia, among other venues, between October 1921 and March 1922. Later in 1922 this spectacular enterprise took off on an even more audacious sales ‘croisade’ around the world on two decommissioned battle cruisers. After sailing through the Suez Canal, the ships crossed the Indian Ocean to Australia and New Zealand, then sailed on to Japan, China and India calling in at major ports along the way where they docked sometimes for up to fourteen days. Contemporary newspaper reports attest to the excitement their arrival caused. Visitors were able to order the goods represented in the selection of <b>autochromes</b> on board, via a catalogue, directly from the manufacturers in France. Among the 2, 045 <b>autochromes</b> that made up the SDGF collection, donated by Devriès in 1929 to the Conservatoire des arts et métiers in Paris, there are 441 plates of women’s fashions, 32 of men’s and 38 of children’s, plus around 360 of accessories, including hats, perfumes, lace, lingerie, fancy dress costumes and hairstyles. The womenswear includes models for town and for sport, evening dress and furs by many Parisian couturiers including Chanel, Patou, Drecoll, Worth, Jenny, Lanvin, Premet, Redfern, Beer, Doucet, Groult, Carette, Henry à la Pensée, Paquin, Prévet, Révillon and Weil. Jewellery by Van Cleef & Arpels, Boucheron, Chaumet and Desausoy was also exhibited. Significantly the SDGF preceded l’Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs by two years. Even more significantly the representation of the colour of the commodities exhibited in the SDGF was captured by the most accurate medium available at the time, and as such, the <b>autochromes</b> provide a unique snapshot of French couture between 1921 - 23. To my knowledge the collection has not yet been digitized, therefore only a dozen or so images from the SDGF are available. These are included in the paper, as well as some from an original catalogue for the exhibition {{and a variety of other}} contextual images...|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of a}} [...] "light box" [...] {{or similar}} highly {{diffused}} artificial light source for viewing <b>Autochromes,</b> although now nearly universal, is unfortunate, as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation. The slight pinkish tinge caused by colloidal scattering (the effect seen through {{a glass of water}} into which a couple of drops of milk have been mixed) is exacerbated, and the use of artificial light—especially fluorescent light—upsets the color rendition of a system which the Lumière Brothers carefully balanced for use with natural daylight.|$|R

50|$|<b>Autochrome,</b> {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} color process, {{was introduced by}} the Lumière brothers in 1907. <b>Autochrome</b> plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments.

5000|$|In practice, an hours-long {{exposure}} to direct sunlight {{was required to}} completely bleach the dyes, making Utocolor paper useless in a camera. It was suitable only for reproducing transparent colored originals, such as stained or [...] "art" [...] glass, paintings on glass, and early photographic color images on glass such as <b>Autochromes.</b> Although rinsing out the catalyst stabilized the prints and made them much less sensitive to light, it did not actually [...] "fix" [...] them by removing all sensitivity, so they were unfit for prolonged open display and were best kept in the protective darkness of a closed album when not being examined.|$|R
5000|$|A new era {{in color}} {{photography}} began {{with the introduction of}} Kodachrome film, available for 16 mm home movies in 1935 and 35 mm slides in 1936. It captured the red, green, and blue color components in three layers of emulsion. A complex processing operation produced complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images in those layers, resulting in a subtractive color image. Maxwell's method of taking three separate filtered black-and-white photographs continued to serve special purposes into the 1950s and beyond, and Polachrome, an [...] "instant" [...] slide film that used the <b>Autochrome's</b> additive principle, was available until 2003, but the few color print and slide films still being made in 2015 all use the multilayer emulsion approach pioneered by Kodachrome.|$|R
50|$|Born in Courbevoie, France to {{a wealthy}} family, Jacques Henri Lartigue started taking {{photographs}} {{when he was}} seven. He photographed {{his friends and family}} at play - running and jumping; racing home-built race cars; making kites, gliders as well as aeroplanes; and climbing the Eiffel Tower. He also photographed sport events, such as the Coupe Gordon Bennett and the French Grand Prix, early flights of aviation pioneers such as Gabriel Voisin, Louis Blériot, Louis Paulhan and Roland Garros. He also captured in his camera, tennis players such as Suzanne Lenglen at the French Open tennis championships. Many of his initial, famous photographs were originally captured through stereo, but he also produced a vast number of images in all formats and media including glass plates in various sizes, <b>autochromes,</b> and film.|$|R

40|$|Surrounded by a {{beautiful}} garden, the Albert Kahn museum in Paris houses {{the most important}} collection of <b>autochromes</b> in the world. This corpus, known as The Archives of the Planet, was created by Albert Kahn, a wealthy French banker who, during and after World War I, ran the project to collect visual documents (photographs and films) about small economic and cultural units about to disappear, {{in order to promote}} peace through a better understanding between people of different cultures. The collection of these documents was made by professional cameramen who, before going to the field, were taught basic principles of human geography as conceptualized by the French scholar Jean Brunhes. This ambitious endeavor, which came to an end in 1932 because of Albert Kahn's bankruptcy, left us with a valuable testimony about the way European elites were relating to science, visual technologies and to other dominated societies {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century. In brief, the Albert Kahn Museum and the Archives of the Planet are worth a visit for both aesthetical and intellectual reasons...|$|R
40|$|Early 1900 s Polar expeditions {{experimented with}} {{photography}} to supplement established modes of documentation, {{from the work}} of exploration to scientific study (zoology, geography, meteorology). In recognition of the economic and educational potential of visual records, R. F. Scott employed ‘camera artist’ Herbert G. Ponting for his 1910 - 13 South Pole expedition: the photographs, lantern slide lectures, film and watercolours interlinked to science formed the basis of public exhibitions. Ponting’s work predominantly consisted of black-and-white images from experiments with telephoto lenses, flashlight photography and cinematography, however, studies of colour exist. <b>Autochromes,</b> dyes and notes on the hues of refracted sunlight and artificial light link photography and colour to the temporality of the Antarctic and the vulnerability of perception. Photography and colour are entwined with mapping of the Antarctic and its cultural interpretation as a ‘landscape’ for public exhibition. 'Mapping the Antarctic' indicates the experiments with colour and photography on late 1800 s and early 1900 s expeditions as embedded in their public presentation and integral to the expression of stasis and movement, of temporality and a permanent record of a fleeting moment as a central paradox of modernity. It includes an analysis of selection of Edward A. Wilson's Antarctic sketches and watercolours...|$|R
50|$|These {{plate and}} film {{products}} differed substantially {{only in the}} means used to manufacture the colour mosaic layer and its resulting pattern and fineness. <b>Autochrome's</b> mosaic was a random array of dyed potato starch grains, {{too small to be}} individually visible without a microscope. Most competing products employed a coarser geometric pattern created by one of the many methods devised and patented during that era. Dufaycolor's filter layer was of the geometric type, but its proprietary manufacturing process produced an unusually fine-patterned mosaic. A very thin coating of collodion {{on one side of the}} film base was dyed blue, printed with closely spaced fine lines using a water-repelling greasy ink, and bleached. The clear spaces created were then dyed green. The ink was removed and new ink lines were printed at a 90 degree angle to the blue and green lines. The new gaps were bleached and dyed red, resulting in a colour filter mosaic, known as a réseau, consisting of alternating green and blue squares between red lines, and having roughly one million colour filter elements per square inch.In very early years, different arrangements of the same colours were used, the lines being green or blue instead of red and sometimes intersecting the other colours diagonally. After a final ink removal and the application of an isolating varnish, the same side of the film base was coated with a panchromatic black-and-white photographic emulsion. When exposed to light through the base and its réseau, the bit of emulsion behind each colour element recorded only the amount of light of that primary colour striking the film at that point.|$|R
