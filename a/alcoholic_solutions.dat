5000|$|The {{musk deer}} {{belongs to the}} family Moschidae and lives in Nepal, India, Pakistan, China, Korea, Siberia and Mongolia. To obtain their musk, the deer is killed and its gland, also called [...] "musk pod", is removed. It is dried either in the sun, on a hot stone, or by {{immersion}} in hot oil.

No other natural substance has such a complex aroma associated with so many contradictory descriptions; however, it is usually described abstractly as animalic, earthy and woody or something akin to the odor of baby's skin.|$|E
40|$|Deposition of {{contacts}} {{is a major}} issue for the preparation of CdZnTe-based detectors. In particular, due to CdZnTe thermal instability above 150 degree Celsius, thermal annealing {{of contacts}} after deposition is not possible. Also for this reason, mechanical stability of contacts is usually poor. In this frame, we have studied mechanical and electrical properties of gold electroless deposited contacts prepared from waterbased and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions.</b> While electrical I-V characteristics are similar in the two cases, showing the typical ???S??? behavior of two diodes in ???back to back??? configuration, contacts prepared from <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions</b> show a much better mechanical stability and can overcome a typical adhesive tape test. The contact structure obtained by water-based and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions</b> has been studied by different techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy, Auger spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy.

40|$|Pre-operative hand-washing is {{essential}} for the reduction of surgical site infection (SSI) rate. This article aims to review the current literature regarding the issues on: (i) the duration of washing; (ii) the use of the brush; and (iii) the reagents used. Based on current evidence, preoperative hand-washing for 10 min is not recommended and 2 - 5 min is adequate. There is no evidence supporting the use of the brush, and washing without the brush may confer further advantages of reducing skin irritation and delayed colonization. The newly developed aqueous <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions</b> (AAS) are equally effective as conventional reagents such as chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone-iodine in preventing SSI. Aqueous <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions</b> have the advantage of better user compliance and causing fewer occupational hazards.

For this reason, a study of the electrodeposition of Ni from various <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions</b> was performed. Apart from a detailed cyclic voltammetry study of these solutions, the surface morphology, crystal structure and texture as well magnetic properties of the deposits have also been investigated. The best results were obtained with methanol as solvent, so results on Ni deposits prepared from this solution will be presented in more detail whereas the case of the other <b>alcoholic</b> <b>solutions</b> investigated will be summarized only briefly. Structural and magnetic properties of the deposits obtained have been compared to literature data on Ni samples obtained from various non-aqueous solvents. © The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.
