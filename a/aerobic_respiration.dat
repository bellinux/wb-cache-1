Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} plants is vital because they {{underpin}} almost all animal life on Earth by generating {{a large proportion}} of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.|$|E

25|$|Cells {{performing}} <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> synthesize {{much more}} ATP, {{but not as}} part of glycolysis. These further aerobic reactions use pyruvate and NADH + H+ from glycolysis. Eukaryotic <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> produces approximately 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule, however {{most of these are}} produced by a vastly different mechanism to the substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis.|$|E
25|$|The lower-energy production, per glucose, of {{anaerobic}} respiration relative to <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration,</b> results in greater flux through the pathway under hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions, unless {{alternative sources of}} anaerobically oxidizable substrates, such as fatty acids, are found.|$|E
25|$|A {{core set}} of energy-producing catabolic {{pathways}} occur within all living organisms in some form. These pathways transfer the energy released by breakdown of nutrients into ATP and other small molecules used for energy (e.g. GTP, NADPH, FADH). All cells can perform anaerobic respiration by glycolysis. Additionally, most organisms can perform more efficient <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally plants, algae and cyanobacteria are able to use sunlight to anabolically synthesize compounds from non-living matter by photosynthesis.|$|E

25|$|This fat-soluble substance, which {{resembles a}} vitamin, {{is present in}} all respiring {{eukaryotic}} cells, primarily in the mitochondria.

50|$|Oxygen is a {{component}} of many organic and inorganic molecules within the plant, and is acquired in many forms. These include: O2 and CO2 (mainly from the air via leaves) and H2O, NO, H2PO and SO (mainly from the soil water via roots).

25|$|The {{tricarboxylic acid}} (TCA) cycle – or citric acid cycle – is an {{important}} step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be oxidized. This oxidation produces the CO2 and H2O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs at its most basic level. Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration.</b>|$|E

Dendropsophus microcephalus, a small tree frog, will produce 100 notes per minute for several hours, requiring up to 25 times more oxygen. Some frogs produce less energetic calls and remain in chorus {{for longer periods of time}} with the ability to remain active longer being better for mating success than a higher energy vocal display.|$|E
25|$|Many {{cyanides}} {{are highly}} toxic. The cyanide anion is an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (also known as aa3) {{in the fourth}} complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that depend highly on <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration,</b> such as {{the central nervous system}} and the heart, are particularly affected. This is an example of histotoxic hypoxia.|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] use of smart tracers to study hydrologic systems is becoming more widespread. Smart tracers are compounds that irreversibly react {{in the presence of a}} process or condition under investigation. Resazurin (Raz) is a smart tracer that undergoes an irreversible reduction to resorufin (Rru) in the presence of cellular metabolic activity. We quantified the relationship between the transformation of Raz and <b>aerobic</b> bacterial <b>respiration</b> in pure culture experiments using two obligate aerobes and two facultative anaerobes, and in colonized surface and shallow (< 10 cm) hyporheic sediments using reach-scale experiments. We found that the transformation of Raz to Rru was nearly perfectly (min r² = 0. 986), positively correlated with <b>aerobic</b> microbial <b>respiration</b> in all experiments. These results suggest that Raz can be used as a surrogate to measure respiration in situ and in vivo at different spatial scales, thus providing an alternative to investigate mechanistic controls of solute transport and stream metabolism on nutrient processing. Lastly, a comparison of respiration and mass-transfer rates in streams suggests that field-scale respiration is controlled by the slower of respiration and mass transfer, highlighting the need to understand both biogeochemistry and physics in stream ecosystems...|$|R
25|$|An {{electron}} {{transport chain}} (ETC) {{is a series}} of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox (both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously) reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H+ ions) across a membrane. This creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that stores energy chemically in the form of highly strained bonds. The molecules of the chain include peptides, enzymes (which are proteins or protein complexes), and others. The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain during <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> is molecular oxygen although a variety of acceptors other than oxygen such as sulfate exist in anaerobic respiration.|$|E

O. oeni is a heterofermenter that create multiple end products {{from the use of}} glucose with D-lactic acid and carbon dioxide being produced in roughly equal amounts to either ethanol or acetate. In reductive conditions (such as near the end of alcoholic fermentation), the third end product is usually ethanol while in slightly oxidative (such as early in alcohol fermentation or in an untopped barrel), the bacteria are more likely to produce acetate.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} carbohydrate is glucose, a simple sugar (monosaccharide) that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms. Glucose and other carbohydrates {{are part of}} a wide variety of metabolic pathways across species: plants synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis storing the absorbed energy internally, often in the form of starch or lipids. Plant components are consumed by animals and fungi, and used as fuel for cellular respiration. Oxidation of one gram of carbohydrate yields approximately 4 kcal of energy, while the oxidation of one gram of lipids yields about 9 kcal. Energy obtained from metabolism (e.g., oxidation of glucose) is usually stored temporarily within cells in the form of ATP. Organisms capable of <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> metabolize glucose and oxygen to release energy with carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.|$|E

Abstention from alcohol reverses the changes in muscle which slowly return to normal. Selective injury to type 2 B fibres indicates that search should be made for an alcohol-induced biochemical lesion affecting the anaerobic glycolytic pathways of the muscle fibre...|$|R
25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to <b>aerobic</b> <b>respiration</b> which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E

50|$|Yeasts are chemoorganotrophs, as {{they use}} organic {{compounds}} {{as a source}} of energy and do not require sunlight to grow.

40|$|Lactococcus lactis is {{a widely}} used food {{bacterium}} mainly characterized for its fermentation metabolism. However, this species undergoes a metabolic shift to respiration when heme is added to an <b>aerobic</b> medium. <b>Respiration</b> results in markedly improved biomass and survival compared to fermentation. Whole-genome microarrays {{were used to assess}} changes in L. lactis expression under aerobic and respiratory conditions compared to static growth, i. e., nonaerated. We observed the following. (i) Stress response genes were affected mainly by aerobic fermentation. This result underscores the differences between <b>aerobic</b> fermentation and <b>respiration</b> environments and confirms that respiration growth alleviates oxidative stress. (ii) Functions essential for respiratory metabolism, e. g., genes encoding cytochrome bd oxidase, menaquinone biosynthesis, and heme uptake, are similarly expressed under the three conditions.

(iii) Expression of only 11 genes distinguishes <b>respiration</b> from both <b>aerobic</b> and static fermentation cultures. Among them, the genes comprising the putative ygfCBA operon are strongly induced by heme regardless of respiration, thus identifying the first heme-responsive operon in lactococci.

40|$|Several {{laboratory}} {{strains of}} gram-negative bacteria {{are known to}} be able to respire nitrate in the presence of oxygen, although the physiological advantage gained from this process is not entirely clear. The contribution that <b>aerobic</b> nitrate <b>respiration</b> makes to the environmental nitrogen cycle has not been studied. As a first step in addressing this question, a strategy which allows for the isolation of organisms capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite following aerobic growth has been developed. Twenty-nine such strains have been isolated from three soils and a freshwater sediment and shown to comprise members of three genera (Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Moraxella). All of these strains expressed a nitrate reductase with an active site located in the periplasmic compartment. Twenty-two of the strains showed significant rates of nitrate respiration in the presence of oxygen when assayed with physiological electron donors. Also isolated was one member of the gram-positive genus Arthrobacter, which was likewise able to respire nitrate in the presence of oxygen but appeared to express a different type of nitrate reductase. In the four environments studied, culturable bacteria capable of <b>aerobic</b> nitrate <b>respiration</b> were isolated in significant numbers (10 (4) to 10 (7) per g of soil or sediment) and in three cases were as abundant as, or more abundant than, culturable bacteria capable of denitrification.

500|$|A {{dominant}} {{role for the}} mitochondria is the production of ATP, as reflected by {{the large number of}} proteins in the inner membrane for this task.
