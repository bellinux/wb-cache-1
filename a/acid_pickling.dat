5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: The EPS {{process as}} a {{replacement}} for <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Smooth clean surface (SCS) and eco {{pickled surface}} (EPS) are more recent alternatives. In the SCS process, surface {{oxidation}} is removed using an engineered abrasive {{and the process}} leaves the surface resistant to subsequent oxidation {{without the need for}} oil film or other protective coating. EPS is a more direct replacement for <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b> <b>Acid</b> <b>pickling</b> relies on chemical reactions while EPS uses mechanical means. The EPS process is considered [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] compared with <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and it imparts to carbon steel a high degree of rust resistance, eliminating the need to apply the oil coating that serves as a barrier to oxidation for acid-pickled carbon steel.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, the EPS {{process is}} {{considered}} less {{damaging to the}} environment than <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> for these reasons: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the free Cl, compounds known as [...] "chloride salts" [...] remain {{on the surface of}} <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> steel in trace amounts, even after rinsing. Chloride salts react rapidly with moisture and accelerate oxidation of iron on the steel's surface. To prevent oxidation of the iron in the <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> strip, a thin film of oil is applied to the surface to serve as a barrier between the free Cl, chloride salts and oxygen. No such protective barrier is needed for EPS-processed steel, as no free Cl or chloride salts are present.|$|R
5000|$|Eco Pickled Surface {{technology}} has been tested and approved {{for use as a}} replacement for <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> steel by automotive manufacturers General Motors and Chrysler. [...] The Eco Pickled Surface process was a finalist in the 2013 American Metal Market (AMM) Awards for Steel Excellence.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to prepare highly acceptable and long shelf-life low <b>acid</b> goat meat <b>pickle</b> and its quality evaluation and storage stability at 32 ± 0. 5 °C. Low <b>acid</b> goat meat <b>pickle</b> was prepared using deboned meat from spent Barbari goat breed. The product was evaluated after an elapse of seven days as maturation, for changes in physico-chemical (pH, titrable acidity), microbiological (Aerobic mesophilic, halophiles, yeast and mould counts) and organoleptic properties at an interval of 15 days up to 60 days of storage at 32 ± 0. 5 °C. Results showed that pH and titrable acidity of the low <b>acid</b> <b>pickles</b> was 4. 87 and 0. 69 whereas in control goat meat pickle, these values were 4. 70 and 0. 76, respectively after 60 days storage period. Microbiological counts and sensory quality traits did not show appreciable change and remained satisfactory throughout the storage period. Low <b>acid</b> <b>pickles</b> had significantly lower sourness and higher overall acceptability compared to the control. Therefore, the present study suggests that a highly acceptable low <b>acid</b> goat meat <b>pickle</b> can be prepared using spent goat meat and can safely be stored on shelf for 60 days even during summer season...|$|R
5000|$|Steel which {{utilizes}} the EPS {{process to}} remove surface scale shows few differences from steel which utilizes <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> to remove surface scale. [...] "Downstream" [...] industrial {{processes such as}} galvanizing, cold reducing and painting of EPS-processed steel strip show it to be interchangeable with acid-pickled steel strip. This also holds true for common sheet metal fabrication processes, such as laser cutting, plasma cutting, stamping, welding, bending, and roll forming - no meaningful difference between steel strip using the EPS process and steel strip using <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In jewelry making, {{pickling}} is used {{to remove}} the copper oxide layer that results from heating copper and sterling silver during soldering and annealing. A diluted sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> bath is traditionally used, but may be replaced with citric acid.|$|E
50|$|The {{scrubbing}} {{pressure of}} ice particles can {{be up to}} 300 bar. In many applications in oil and grease removal, ice blasting can produce essentially oil-free surfaces. In some metal finishing operations, ice blast {{has been shown to}} be superior to conventional <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b>|$|E
50|$|The milk-souring {{bacterium}} Lactobacillus bulgaricus {{is used to}} make yoghurt and cheese. Bacteria are used, too, to form organic <b>acids</b> in <b>pickles</b> and vinegar.|$|R
40|$|A Ni-B coating was electroless-deposited {{directly}} on acetic <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> AZ 91 D. The plating rate {{was found to}} be influenced by pH, temperature, and bath composition. The electroless Ni-B plating exhibits a uniform surface and an amorphous structure. Polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in 3. 5 wt. % sodium chloride aqueous solution suggest that the plating can protect the magnesium alloy substrate from corrosion attack. It is proposed that different deposition reactions dominate in different stages of the plating process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The {{closure of}} the coke ovens in March 1972 allowed work to {{commence}} on removing the 19th century [...] "drill ground" [...] tip, which contained 500,000 tons of waste material. Once the waste removal was complete, British Steel showed plans for the redevelopment of Ebbw Vale. The former waste site was back-filled, and allowed the cold rolling mill to be extended. This was now able to supply sufficient capacity of rolled steel to a new tinplate complex, the development of which started in 1974 with the commissioning of a newly built hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>pickle</b> line.|$|R
50|$|The EPS process {{produces}} scale-free {{steel strip}} which is interchangeable with acid-pickled steel strip, yet the EPS process entails lower capital and operating (variable) cost than an acid-pickling line of equivalent output. For this reason the EPS process {{is considered to}} be a direct replacement of <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fluoroboric acid is the {{principal}} precursor to fluoroborate salts, which are typically prepared by treating the metal oxides with fluoroboric acid. The inorganic salts are intermediates {{in the manufacture of}} flame-retardant materials and glazing frits, and in electrolytic generation of boron. HBF4 is also used in aluminum etching and <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed steel strip {{is superior to}} that of acid pickled steel strip primarily because <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not. This penalty {{is a result of}} chemical reactions that occur after <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and serve as a catalyst for oxidation. The primary pickling agent is hydrochloric acid (HCl). Although the steel strip is thoroughly rinsed with clean water after immersion in the HCl bath, some residual amount of chlorine (Cl) remains {{on the surface of the}} strip. Chlorine reacts very readily with oxygen to form chlorides, so the free Cl acts as something of a [...] "magnet" [...] for oxygen. This mechanism makes acid-pickled steel more prone to picking up oxygen, whereas there is no comparable mechanism at work with EPS mechanical pickling.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium {{benzoate}} is a preservative. As a food additive, {{sodium benzoate}} has the E number E211. It is bacteriostatic and fungistatic under acidic conditions. It is {{most widely used}} in acidic foods such as salad dressings (vinegar), carbonated drinks (carbonic acid), jams and fruit juices (citric <b>acid),</b> <b>pickles</b> (vinegar), and condiments. It is also used as a preservative in medicines and cosmetics. [...] Concentration as a food preservative {{is limited by the}} FDA in the U.S. to 0.1% by weight. [...] Sodium benzoate is also allowed as an animal food additive at up to 0.1%, according to AFCO's official publication.|$|R
50|$|When both salt {{concentration}} and temperature are low, Leuconostoc mesenteroides dominates, producing {{a mix of}} acids, alcohol, and aroma compounds. At higher temperatures Lactobacillus plantarum dominates, which produces primarily lactic <b>acid.</b> Many <b>pickles</b> start with Leuconostoc, and change to Lactobacillus with higher acidity.|$|R
25|$|Benzoic {{acid and}} its salts {{are used as}} a food preservatives, {{represented}} by the E-numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Acidic food and beverage like fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric <b>acid),</b> <b>pickles</b> (vinegar) or other acidified food are preserved with benzoic acid and benzoates.|$|R
50|$|Sheet steel that {{undergoes}} <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> will oxidize (rust) {{when exposed}} to atmospheric conditions of moderately high humidity. For this reason, a thin film of oil or similar waterproof coating is applied to create a barrier to moisture in the air. This oil film must later be removed for many fabrication, plating or painting processes.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} can {{be prevented}} through several methods, {{all of which are}} centered on minimizing contact between the metal and hydrogen, particularly during fabrication. Embrittling procedures such as <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> should be avoided, as should increased contact with elements such as sulfur and phosphate. The use of proper electroplating solution and procedures can also help to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Furthermore, metal substrates (generally ferrous sulfide or other sulfides) can be applied to metal in order to prevent hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
50|$|Eco {{pickled surface}} (EPS) {{is a process}} applied to hot rolled sheet steel to remove all surface oxides (mill scale) and clean the steel surface. Steel which has {{undergone}} the EPS process acquires {{a high degree of}} resistance to subsequent development of surface oxide (rust), so long as it does not come into direct contact with moisture. EPS was developed by The Material Works, Ltd., which has filed several patent applications covering the process. It is primarily intended to be a replacement of the familiar <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> process wherein steel strip is immersed in solutions of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids to chemically remove oxides.|$|E
40|$|The Boeing {{wedge test}} {{was applied to}} joints of {{aluminium}} alloy made with three adhesives differing widely in toughness. Bonding pretreatments chromic [...] . sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>pickle,</b> chromic <b>acid</b> anodise and wet alumina grit blast were compared for two of he adhesives, and clear differences in crack length appeared after exposure to 50 C and 96 % r. h. Rates of crack growth were determined in both ambient and warm humid environments, and suitable times are suggested for measurement of crack length. Wedge driving speed can affect results and should be standardised. Results are more informative if shown as fracture energies rather than crack lengths, and the approximations involved are discussed. Practical aspects of the test are described and possible errors quantified. Fracture energies typically showed coefficients of variation of 5 - 20 %...|$|R
50|$|Acidic {{foods and}} {{beverages}} such as fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbonic acid), soft drinks (phosphoric <b>acid),</b> and <b>pickles</b> (vinegar) may be preserved with potassium benzoate. It is approved {{for use in}} most countries including Canada, the U.S., and the EU, where it is designated by the E number E212.|$|R

5000|$|The Detroit {{plant is}} a {{finishing}} facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units are two 50 in., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold anneal and pickle line, a temper mill, two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills, are essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and combined, {{they both have}} an annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line was installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consists of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace where the strip is heated above [...] and three <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper is interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{tubes are}} made from the large billets of copper that are {{gradually}} worked and drawn down to the required size. As the tubes are drawn they are heat treated to produce the correct mechanical properties. The organic oils and greases used to lubricate the tubes during the drawing processes are broken down during the heat treatment and gradually coat the tube with a film of carbon. If the carbon is left in the bore of the tube then it disrupts {{the formation of the}} protective scale and allows the initiation of pits in the wall. The presence of deleterious films, such as carbon, has been prohibited by the British Standards in copper tubes since 1969. All copper tubes for water service are treated, usually by grit blasting or <b>acid</b> <b>pickling,</b> to remove any films produced during manufacture with the result that Type 1 pitting initiated by carbon films is now very rare.|$|E
5000|$|Pickling sludge is {{the waste}} product from pickling, and {{includes}} acidic rinse waters, iron chlorides, and metallic salts and waste acid. Spent pickle liquor {{is considered a}} hazardous waste by the EPA. Pickle sludge from steel processes is usually neutralized with lime and disposed of in a landfill since the EPA no longer deems it a hazardous waste after neutralization. The lime neutralization process raises the pH of the spent acid. The waste material is subject to a waste determination to ensure no characteristic or listed waste is present. [...] Since the 1960s, hydrochloric pickling sludge is often treated in a hydrochloric acid regeneration system, which recovers some of the hydrochloric acid and ferric oxide. The rest must still be neutralized and disposed of in land fills or managed as a hazardous waste based on the waste profile analysis. [...] The by-products of nitric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> are marketable to other industries, such as fertilizer processors.|$|E
25|$|These two {{chemicals}} {{were very}} important because they enabled {{the introduction of a}} host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. Early uses for sulphuric <b>acid</b> included <b>pickling</b> (removing rust) iron and steel, and for bleaching cloth.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{fermented}} {{products are}} reported to contain lactic <b>acid</b> bacteria, including <b>pickled</b> vegetables, [...] tempeh, miso, kefir, buttermilk or karnemelk, kimchi, pao cai, sauerkraut, and soy sauce.|$|R
5000|$|As with pickled cucumbers, {{there are}} {{multiple}} ways of pickling peppers. The most common is as above, pickling in an acidic brine and canned; next is quick-pickled or refrigerator pickling, which skips the canning step and requires the peppers to be stored in the refrigerator as mentioned above. For lacto-fermented pickled peppers, vinegar is omitted from the salty brine; instead, Lactobacilli convert the sugars of the peppers into lactic <b>acid.</b> Such fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers are often used to make hot sauce. At less than 3% <b>acid,</b> fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers are highly perishable if not canned. Sweet pickling with sugar and acid yields [...] "candied" [...] peppers, as for the jalapeños known as [...] "cowboy candy". Pickled peppers are often made into relishes.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{smoothness}} {{is one of}} {{the properties}} determining the performance of stents. Therefore, surface polishing shows its importance in the exploitation and production of stents. The present study explores electrochemical polishing of 316 L stainless steel slotted tube coronary stents produced by laser cutting. <b>Acid</b> <b>pickling</b> was also studied as a pre-treatment of electrochemical polishing of the stents to remove the slag (oxides) formed in the production of the stents. Meanwhile, removal of the material was measured as well, caused by both <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and electrochemical polishing processes. It is found that the slag formed on the surface of stents due to the laser cutting production process could be removed by means of <b>acid</b> <b>pickling.</b> Electrochemical polishing results in a smooth stent surface. Meanwhile, both <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and electrochemical polishing applied in the present study have a proper removal of the stent material.

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrochloric}} <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> {{process which}} is widely applied in carbon steel pickling ensures high speeds with little pollution. In this research, hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> process was introduced into stainless steel pickling {{to improve the}} surface integrity. Research indicated that the impedance spectrum obtained from 430 SS in HCl solution consisted of a capacitive loop at high frequencies and an inductive loop at low frequencies. As the concentration of hydrochloric acid rose, the radiuses of the capacitive loop decreased. And the corrosion potential of 430 SS in hydrochloric acid solution moved to positive direction with band to a narrow 0. 1 V. And high HCl concentration more markedly influenced the charge-transfer resistance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{surface quality}} of {{coronary}} stents {{has a significant}} influence on its biocompatibility. Therefore, surface polishing {{is of paramount importance}} in the production and application of stents. In the present study, electropolishing is performed on 316 LVM steel slotted tube coronary stents. Additionally, <b>acid</b> <b>pickling,</b> as a pretreatment of electropolishing, is also conducted. Gravimetric analysis of the stents (weight loss and strut width change) in the process of <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> and electropolishing are done. Qualitative roughness measurements are made to evaluate the stent surface. Electropolished stents are passivated causing chromium enrichment {{on the surface of the}} material, thereby enhancing its corrosion resistance. Passivated and electropolished samples are examined using energy dispersive spectrometry. Balloon expanded and crimped profiles of the passivated stents are qualitatively analyzed...|$|E
