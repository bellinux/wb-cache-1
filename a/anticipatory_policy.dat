5000|$|The policy {{sciences}} {{provide an}} integrated and comprehensive approach for addressing issues and problems {{at all levels}} in ways that help clarify and secure the common interest. Policy sciences are concerned with helping people make better decisions toward fostering human dignity for all. Since {{we are living in}} a [...] "turbulent field" [...] environment, policy science is necessary to address issues before it will get bigger. The approach of Policy Sciences, as cited by Flor in his article, is forward-looking or <b>anticipatory.</b> <b>Policy</b> sciences tell us {{what we need to do}} and prepare before certain issues or problems occur. Using an allegorical definition, Dror (1971), as cited by Ongkiko and Flor (2006), explains that “one should not leave the problem of crossing a river until the river is reached; rather, one should survey the territory in advance, identify rivers flowing through it, decide whether it is at all necessary to cross the river - and if so, where and how to cross it - then prepare in advance the materials for crossing the river and design a logistic network so that the material is ready when the river is reached.” Furthermore, given its interdisciplinary and holistic nature, policy sciences does consider several variables (education, communication, money, culture) in coming up with a decision. These variables are important factors in coming up with a sound and relevant policy.|$|E

This paper discusses the notion of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policy</b> by using three cases from ocean policy, deepwater ports, ocean thermal energy conversion, and deep seabed mining. Such policies tend to be extremely vulnerable to changes in the economic and political environments within which they operate. In order to understand how such policies succeed or fail requires that studies of policy implementation decades, not just several years. Although there has been a move in this direction in assessing social welfare policies, this approach has been far less evident in the natural resources area.

40|$|Drought is a normal, {{recurrent}} {{feature of}} climate that affects virtually all countries to some degree. The number of drought-induced natural disasters has grown significantly since the 1960 s, {{largely as a}} result of increasing vulnerability to extended periods of precipitation deficiency rather than be-cause of an increase in the frequency of meteorological droughts. This increase in drought-induced natural disasters has resulted in a considerable growth of interest in drought mitigation and prepar-edness worldwide. The purpose of a national preparedness plan is to reduce societal vulnerability to drought through the adoption of preventive, <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies</b> and programs. This paper de-scribes a ten-step planning process that nations can follow to develop a drought preparedness plan.

40|$|Drought {{policies}} {{have generally been}} attempts to manage, adapt to, and ameliorate the impacts of climate variability {{with the assumption that}} this is variability around long-term averages in rainfall, temperatures, and crop and water yields. As noted in Chapter 1, this results in either or both reac­tive policies to address the effects of particular droughts and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies</b> to encourage resources managers to prepare for dry periods. With the emergence of concerns about climate change, discussions of drought policy will increasingly have to consider both variability and the possibility of underlying long-term changes in the key climatic variables-that is, non­ stationarity. This chapter will first review the points where the sciences relat­ing to climate change and climate variability are intersecting. Second, the policy implications of adjusting to increased variability and, in some cases, increasing drought frequency are considered. Third, there is a discussion {{of the ways in which}} popular narratives about drought and climate change interact, with a particular focus on the ways that resource users interpret the two phenomena and in some cases use one (drought) to refute the other (climate change). ...|$|R
40|$|Defense and {{military}} priorities {{have changed in}} the post-Cold-War era in many nations. Decreases in military and defense spending have resulted in layoffs in defense-related industries, creating dislocated defense-dependent workers and affecting economic and social conditions in their communities. How countries cope with the labor repercussions of restructuring in defense differs across nations. Their policy choices {{are rooted in the}} historical and institutional paths of their political economies. In this paper the author compares defense restructuring and its effects on workers through an analysis of policies in Sweden and the United States. Both the United States and Sweden have maintained strong military and defense sectors, for different reasons, but demonstrate most-different systems design with regard to labor policies affecting a dislocated workforce. It is argued that the dominant 'warfare' state policies of the United States forced the country to develop a set of reactive policies to defense restructuring, more focused on technology and existing defense firms than on the retraining and reemployment needs of its former defense workforce. Sweden's welfare state model, by contrast, enabled defense-sector dislocations to be treated {{in the same way as}} other industrial restructuring in the past, by a set of well-developed labor and social policies that encouraged retraining and reemployment of workers. Case studies from both nations highlight these differences. The <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies</b> in Sweden were better able to cope with structural changes fromdefense restructuring than were the largely reactive policies of the United States. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{effects of}} changes in mineral {{commodity}} prices on monetary policy. Using macroeconomic data from five developed countries (Australia, Canada and New Zealand as mineral-producing countries, and the US and the UK as non-mineral-resource countries), I estimate the impulse response functions of the policy interest rates and the core consumer price index (CPI) inflation rates to mineral-commodity price shocks. I find that, {{in response to an}} unexpected 10 percent increase in mineral commodity prices, the central banks in the mineral-producing countries are estimated to increase their policy interest rates by approximately one percentage point, and they seem to take <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policy</b> reactions to control core CPI variations triggered by these shocks. Thus, mineral commodity prices appear to be important determinants of the monetary policies in the mineral-producing countries. However, the effects of the increase in their policy interest rates on core CPI inflation are different across the examined mineral-producing countries. I also find that the central banks in the non-mineral- resource countries insignificantly respond to mineral-commodity price shocks because such price shocks have little impact on those countries'core CPI inflation...|$|E
40|$|To be {{a player}} in the {{international}} standards-setting arena of network industries, such as those dealing with information technology, reaching an early domestic consensus for a critical interoperable technology design is often essential. While in most cases efficient outcomes emerge through the market-driven, U.

40|$|This study {{spotlights}} {{the inadequacy}} of the sectoral modeling used hitherto to analyse structural change in Australia. Although the multiplier and key-sector results demonstrate that contemporary Australia is predominantly an industrial economy, {{in the next decade}} the growth of the information intensiveness of economic activity or informatization will accelerate. A sectoral model clearly identifying the information sector is proposed to study the implications of the growing information intensiveness of the Australian economy. A methodology to identify the primary information economy or information commodities traded in the market is explained. The macroeconomic scenarios-income and price implications-of programming for various targets of information sector activities are analysed. Three plausible informatization targets are hypothesised: Luddite or zero growth; laissez-faire or continuing the status quo and sunrise or accelerated performance. The significance of Leontief accounting prices based on competitive equilibria and the shadow prices connoting opportunity costs of the linear programming dual are examined. Fiscal policies to subsidise positive externalities generated by informatization, in the fase of intractability of the Pigouvian ideal taxes are briefly reviewed. Finally, the need for <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policy</b> decisions in Australia to harness the full benefits of informatization is emphasised...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} which factors drive the formation of policy preferences when there are remaining uncertainties about the causes and effects of the problem at stake. To answer this question we examine policy preferences reducing aquatic micropollutants, a specific case of water protection policy and different actor groups (e. g. state, science, target groups). Here, we contrast two types of policy preferences: a) preventive or source-directed policies, which mitigate pollution {{in order to avoid}} contact with water; and b) reactive or end-of-pipe policies, which filter water already contaminated by pollutants. In a second step, we analyze the drivers for actors’ policy preferences by focusing on three sets of explanations, i. e. participation, affectedness and international collaborations. The analysis of our survey data, qualitative interviews and regression analysis of the Swiss political elite show that participation in the policy-making process leads to knowledge exchange and reduces uncertainties about the policy problem, which promotes preferences for preventive policies. Likewise, actors who are affected by the consequences of micropollutants, such as consumer or environmental associations, opt for <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies.</b> Interestingly, we find that uncertainties about the effectiveness of preventive policies can promote preferences for end-of-pipe policies. While preventive measures often rely on (uncertain) behavioral changes of target groups, reactive policies are more reliable when it comes to fulfilling defined policy goals. Finally, we find that in a transboundary water management context, actors with international collaborations prefer policies that produce immediate and reliable outcomes...|$|R
40|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{feature of}} international environmental discourse since the late- 1980 s {{has been the}} shift toward <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies.</b> Precaution is the leading policy approach that has emerged to guide environmental decision-makers confronted with inadequate information. The 2 ̆ 2 precautionary principle 2 ̆ 2 has found expression in Australia in the 1992 Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, various Commonwealth environmental management strategies {{and a number of}} pieces of Commonwealth and State legislation. It also has been accepted tentatively by the courts as a factor which should be taken into account in appropriate circumstances. However, existing Australian environmental management approaches fail to advance precaution in a substantive manner. Most hope for the advancement of precaution has rested on its potential to be a mandatory consideration by ministerial authorities when exercising planning powers. However, courts have cast doubt on the legal status of the principle because of the typically weak formulations of it in legislation and policy documents. In this article, a method is suggested by which the principle could be integrated systematically in environmental planning so that it could be given effect in environmental management practice. The writer proposes that environmental impact assessment (EIA) Australia 2 ̆ 7 s foremost environmental protection regime should be modified to give effect to the precautionary principle.

Yet in New Zealand, the legislation enabling such intervention, the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA), makes no reference to the term urban or any of the elements of the urban environment. This thesis proposes that there is a remit, and indeed a requirement, under the RMA to sustainably manage the built form, and that this should be sought through <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies</b> in district plans. The extent to which elements of urban planning are currently being provided for in operative district plans was examined using content analysis as a research method - i. e. a word count of specific words/phrases relating to urban elements from which inferences could be drawn. The results indicated that elements of urban planning are being provided for in district plan provisions to a greater or lesser extent, although in most instances were not within its 'power house', i. e. the objectives and policies. Further interpretive analysis of actual district plan text suggests that references to urban elements lacked specificity. The results also showed that few associations existed between the various urban elements examined, and that there were no clear causal factors for high urban element word counts. This paper concludes that planners can confidently provide for elements of urban planning in district plans. In doing so their legacy will be district plans that are more strategic, and therefore in alignment with the purpose of the RMA - the sustainable management of natural and physical resources - as opposed to the prevailing view that they should take a more retrospective perspective, seeking only to avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of activities on the environment...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to estimating a population‟s capacity to travel by walking and cycling (also {{referred to as}} active modes) is presented. Estimating capacity to walk and cycle is distinct from predicting future walking and cycling behaviour based upon current behaviour. Capacity is useful in developing <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policy</b> responses to transport scenarios which are not based on current trends or are attempting to encourage transformational policies. We identify several possible application areas for this method (an indicator of resilience to permanent reduction in fuel supply; assessing walking and cycling as a strategy to adapt to short term fuel disruptions; improvement of walking cycling targets; better estimation of the service area of public transport stops; integration into accessibility measures and better understanding transport based social exclusion). Current estimations of capacity to walk and cycle applied by practitioners are poor: Frequently a simple distance buffer is applied, or the whole population‟s capacity to travel is estimated based on the current behaviour of {{a small sample of}} existing cyclists. Factors such as the variation in physical capability between individuals and topography are ignored. The improved model we describe incorporates an estimate of the maximum distance that could physically be travelled by an individual given a time budget, given their physical health, age characteristics, topography, headwinds, constraints on travel such as bike availability and the need to incorporate escort trips on the way to activities. The focus of this paper is on explaining the method of estimating capacity of individuals to travel by active modes. However, we explain that the model can be implemented for the whole population of many small zones by using spatial microsimulation (also known as population synthesis) to generate the individual attributes required as inputs to the model. A simple example demonstrates that this modelling process can produce a considerable improvement in estimation of capacity to travel by active modes over simple buffer methods...|$|E

We nd that the simple global policy that captures the proxy load information along the request path can provide reasonably good load sharing, and that, to e ectively share the load, it is necessary to provide the edge proxies a mechanism to push up some transcoding load. On the caching policy, we examine policies that allow di erent versions of an object to be cached.

40|$|Background: The 2009 - 10 {{influenza}} A(H 1 N 1) pandemic was {{the first}} pandemic influenza {{of the twenty-first century}} and presented the first major opportunity for the use of influenza vaccines en-masse during a pandemic scenario. National <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies</b> of pandemic influenza vaccine preparedness were implemented, and vaccine guarantee agreements were activated. Large quantities of vaccines were purchased and made available to identified citizens {{over the course of the}} pandemic. The use of pandemic influenza vaccines has been examined in this research. Methods: A comparative health policy approach in five study countries (Sweden, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and Canada) was conducted. Qualitative interviews (n= 36) were undertaken in each country with key pandemic influenza response personnel (n = 39). Participants included public health officials, policy makers and clinicians engaged at national country response level. Interviews facilitated discussions surrounding the 2009 - 10 influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic response and use of vaccines. Documentary examination of available records supplemented the analysis of the interview data. Results: Several interview themes were identified following data analysis of the use of pandemic vaccines in the study countries. Themes of the vaccine use included: single or multiple vaccine supplier routes; hemisphere variation; historical pandemic legacy; targeted populations; setting vaccination priorities; side effect concerns; perceived effectiveness of vaccines during the pandemic influenza response. The themes which were most prominent comprised the sourcing and distribution of the vaccines during the response and the associated communication challenges. The necessary prioritisation of vaccines caused extensive discussions and uneasiness by the pandemic influenza response personnel as the initial vaccines arrived in small quantities and required allocation, especially in circumstances where country’s intended for all/most citizens to eventually have access to the vaccine. The variation in timing of the vaccination campaigns and disease activity would suggest that subsequent influenza wave morbidities and mortalities could have been reduced if vaccines had been available more promptly. The southern hemisphere country, New Zealand, exemplified the circumvention of vaccine safety concerns through the use of a trivalent vaccine inclusive of H 1 N 1. Conclusions: Pandemic vaccines were the cornerstone of two countries responses and were associated with high uptake rates. Vaccine discussions, such as prioritisation and essential workers estimates, can be established during interpandemic phases by pandemic influenza response personnel. The use of annual seasonal influenza vaccines that are inclusive of the novel pandemic influenza strain should play a greater role in future pandemic influenzas, should the vaccination campaign timing be appropriate, as this may reduce public anxiety concerning the perceived safety of novel vaccines. The use of the 2009 - 10 influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic vaccines had varied in success and the lessons learnt from this event have important implications for future policy. Pandemic influenza response personnel are recommended to prepare as fully as possible during this interpandemic period...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{areas are}} prime targets for {{international}} terrorists given {{the array of}} valuable physical and social infrastructure they contain. Whereas traditionally governmental, financial, critical infrastructure or military targets have been attacked, increasingly terrorism is targeted at everyday crowded urban spaces which are {{by their very nature}} difficult to defend. Subsequently this has led to a wave of pre-emptive and <b>anticipatory</b> counter-terrorism <b>policy</b> in the West in an attempt to secure the defence of the future city. In such policy-making urban terror attacks are viewed as inevitable and unavoidable, but the nature of such attacks is seen as fluid. Notably, recent commando-style attacks against non-western cities — in Mumbai and Lahore in late 2008 and early 2009 respectively — and against soft, unprotected targets has led to a reassessment of western urban security strategies and an assumption that such terrorist modus operandi will migrate to western cities. Such an uncritical reading, as exemplified by the western bias in media reporting in the aftermath of these events, highlights the need for scholars and policy-makers to engage with alternative readings of these events and illuminate the contextual factors underlying terrorism and its tactics, and target selection in particular locations. In developing a more rounded and reflexive understanding of terrorism as a method, planners and policy-makers might be {{in a better position to}} progress more nuanced security strategies that aim to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism rather than simply reacting through militarizing an increasing array of urban spaces. ...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{research}} into the ethics of emerging technologies, often involving foresight studies, technology assessment or application of the precautionary principle, raises significant epistemological challenges by failing to explain the relative epistemic status of contentious normative claims about future states. This weakness means that it is unclear why the conclusions reached by these approaches should be considered valid, for example in anticipatory ethical assessment or governance of emerging technologies. This paper explains and responds to this problem by proposing an account of how the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims can be established in ethical and political discourses based on Jürgen Habermas’ discourse ethics. To better {{understand the nature of}} the problem, the relationship between norms, facts and the future is explored in light of potential meta-ethical fallacies faced in the field of empirical ethics. Weaknesses of current approaches to anticipatory ethical assessment and governance are then explored, including the Precautionary Principle and Technology Assessment. We argue that the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims can be understood within Habermas’ approach to political discourse, which requires ‘translation’ of uncertain claims to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse. Translation thus provides a way to allow for uncertain normative claims to be considered alongside other types of validity claims in discourse. The paper contributes a conceptual account of the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims in discourse and begins to develop a ‘methodology of translation’ which can be further developed for approaches to research and ethical assessment supporting <b>anticipatory</b> evidence-based <b>policy,</b> governance and system design...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} of Swiss agricultural markets {{will not only}} decrease crop price levels but {{is also expected to}} increase the volatility of prices. Even though these potential increases in price volatilities for Swiss producers are acknowledged as an important fact, no empirical estimates are available yet. To fill this gap, we estimate absolute and relative crop price volatilities of wheat, barley, maize, triticale, potato, rapeseed, and sugar beet applying autoregressive models using annual price data for the period 1991 – 2009. The results for Switzerland are compared with estimates for the USA, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Relative price volatilities, expressed by the coefficient of variation, are found to be lower in Switzerland by a factor of 2 – 3 compared to the other considered countries. For some crops such as potatoes the differences are even higher. An increase in price volatilities of this magnitude due to market liberalization may become a threat to Swiss farmers. Thus, <b>anticipatory</b> actions of <b>policy</b> makers and producers with regard to the development of price risk management strategies might worth to be considered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{originated}} {{in a short}} exploratory piece of work for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), {{in the nature of}} a "strategic reconnaissance" of a complex knot of environmental-social problems. However, early forays indicated strong underlying parallels with issues being explored in other case studies in the Institutional Settings and Environmental Policies (INS) project at IIASA. For this reason, and despite its limited external resources, the Himalaya work written up here took its place as one part of a troika INS project, that also involved research on hazardous waste management and on energy policy modeling. Though the main effort has been on hazardous waste management, the intellectual connections between these apparently diverse research fields have proved most instructive. These connections {{have to do with the}} ways in which uncertainties (both technical and social) are defined by institutions, especially regulatory and policy analytic bodies. The thrust of research on all these fronts has been to better characterise different kinds of uncertainty and to explore the origins and policy implications of conflicting problem definitions. The practical aim in this effort has been to encourage better policy design. An understanding of the institutional roots of uncertainty and of multiple problem definitions opens the way for an <b>anticipatory</b> style of <b>policy</b> formulation that is capable of evaluating the implementability, and thus viability, of different policy options and institutional arrangements.

40|$|High-frequency {{transit systems}} are {{essential}} for the socioeconomic and environmental well-being of large and dense cities. The planning and control of their operations are important determinants of service quality. Transit operators are increasingly adopting data collection devices that enable real-time monitoring of vehicle locations and demand, but existing models and current practice limit the utility of this information. This research develops new concepts, frameworks, and models for real-time optimization of operations, utilizing both historical and real-time information originating from connected data collection devices, including automated vehicle location, automated fare collection, and automatic passenger counting systems. Previous control strategies either do not forecast system states or rely on forecasts based on running times and demand assumed to be static. This research develops an optimization model for holding-based control that incorporates dynamics, producing a holding policy that accounts {{not only for the}} current state of the system, but also for expected changes in running times and demand, due to both exogenous and endogenous dynamics. This information advantage can lead to improved performance when a transit service faces typical changes in running times and demand over time, as well as potentially disruptive events such as signal failures, disabled rolling stock, and demand surges. <b>Anticipatory</b> control <b>policies</b> allow the transit service to react before disruptions develop. It is shown that information about dynamics is particularly valuable when it leads to better predictions of capacity being reached. Although headway and optimization-based control strategies generally outperform schedule-adherence strategies, high-frequency operations are mostly planned with schedules, in part because operators must observe resource constraints (neglected by most control strategies) while planning and delivering service. This research develops a schedule-free paradigm for high-frequency transit operations, in which trip sequences and departure times are optimized in real-time, employing stop-skipping strategies and utilizing real-time information to maximize service quality while satisfying operator resource constraints. Following a discussion of possible methodological approaches, a simple methodology is applied to operate a simulated transit service without schedules. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the new paradigm and suggest possible methodology improvements. by Gabriel Eduardo Sánchez-Martínez. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|A key {{question}} {{that so far}} has received relatively little attention in the germane literature {{is that of the}} changes at various airports {{as a result of the}} EU liberalization policies. That is, presently, most major European airports still benefit from the so-called home-carrier phenomenon where the country's publicly or semi-publicly owned carrier uses the country's main airport as its gateway hub and, consequently, the home-carrier is also the principal user of this airport (in terms of proportion of total aircraft movements, number of passengers transported, connections, slots ownership, etc.). The country's main airport has substantially benefited from these monopoly conditions of airline captivity, strongly determined by the bilateral system of international air transport regulation. Therefore, European major airports were used to operate in essentially different markets, compared to the increasingly competitive markets of their home based carriers. This partly explains relative stability of transport volumes and financial results of European major airports compared to the relatively volatile financial results of most European national airlines. However, the liberalization of European aviation is likely to change this situation. Market access is open now to all community carriers, i. e. carriers with majority ownership and effective control in the hands of EU citizens. Ticket prices are free, governments can only intervene in case of dumping or excessive pricing. A community airline can choose its seat in any of the 15 member states. Licensing procedures are harmonized between member states. In the last few months community carriers have had unrestricted route access within the EU. Most probably this development will be extended to countries inside and outside Europe. Last year the European Commission got the mandate to start negotiations with 10 other European countries. In the meantime the EC has also started negotiations with the USA on so-called soft rights. In the meantime, open skies agreements have been concluded between the USA and most of the EU member states to facilitate strategic alliances between airlines of the states involved. As a result of this on-going liberalization the model of the single 'national' carrier using the national home base as its single hub for the designated third, fourth and sixth freedom operations will stepwise disappear. Within the EU the concept of the national carrier has already been replaced by that of the community carrier. State ownership in more and more European carriers is reduced. On the longer run mergers or even bankruptcy will further undermine the "single national carrier - single national hub" model in Europe. In the meantime, strategic alliances between national carriers in Europe will already reduce the airlines' loyalty to a single airport. Profit maximization and accountability to share holders will supersede the loyalty of these newly emerging alliances, probably looking for the opportunities of a multiple hub network to adequately cover the whole European market. As a consequence, some European airports might see a substantial decline in arriving, departing and transfer traffic, thus in revenues and financial solvency, as well as in their connection to other inter-continental and intra-European destinations. At the same time, other airports might realize a significant increase in traffic as they will be sought after by the profit maximizing airlines as their major gateway hubs. Which will be the losing airports and which will be the winning ones? Can airports anticipate the actions of airlines in deregulated markets and utilize policies which will improve their relative position? If so, what should be these <b>anticipatory</b> <b>policies?</b> These questions become the more urgent, since an increasing number of major European airports will be privatized in the near future. Although increasing airport congestion in Europe will also be reflected in a growing demand pressure for airport slots, this is not a guarantee for a stable transport volume growth of individual airports. The more volatile the market is, the more vulnerable privatized airports become. Therefore, the main issue of this study is the analysis of the opportunities of major European airports to become a central hub as a result of the network choices made by the new European airlines in a completely liberalized market. In a previous study (Berechman and de Wit, 1996), we already explored the potential of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol of becoming the major West-European hub, once European aviation markets are deregulated. A major hindrance of that study was the use of a single hub-and-spoke network. For example that model could not analyze the viability of different combinations of European hubs within a multiple hub network of alternative airline alliances. In this study, we have formulated the model of a multi-hub network where two West-European airports are used for inter-continental and intra-European travel to enable a more realistic analysis of hub choice. Like the previous one also this multi-hub model is primarily used to assess the potential ability of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for becoming a major West-European hub. Thus, in particular, the policy tests focus on this airport in a double hub network...|$|R

Scarce water resources must be conserved for future needs, {{and there is a}} current trend in water management favouring the use of pricing mechanisms to reduce existing demand for water. Pricing and property rights mechanisms are believed to be a means of controlling water use, but there is uncertainty over how effective they are for changing behaviour. This uncertainty is compounded by a lack of information on the beliefs and attitudes which influence water use. An ethnographic research approach was taken to identify factors which influence beliefs and attitudes to water use, and the case study of mid-Canterbury highlights the ambivalence to water conservation policies. Data obtained from interviews and newspaper articles shows that social and cultural beliefs and attitudes about water use and management may limit the effectiveness of pricing mechanisms to change people's water use. Dominant beliefs about an adequate water supply and an implicit right to use water, combined with attitudes about the individual benefits of water use, outweigh or override normative beliefs about conserving water. Moreover, cultural beliefs that water charges imply resource ownership creates resistance to the use of pricing and property rights mechanisms to achieve water conservation. The lack of strong support for water conservation further reflects the interests of powerful water user groups who have more influence in the policymaking process. Policymakers may need to consider a broader range of policy tools to elicit community support for controls on water use. Addressing beliefs and attitudes is a necessary step to effectively achieving water conservation objectives...|$|R

The results highlight that communication plays a much larger role in shaping demographic processes…” In her discussion {{of the relationship between}} communicators and their audiences, Natalie T. J. Tindall, {{an associate professor in the}} department of communication at Georgia State University, US, shares “Demographic categories can still tell us a lot about our social structure, and continue to be useful for macro-level understandings of people and societies.” It is with this understanding that policies can be designed more tailor-fit to those it is designed for.Furthermore, the criterion by which a demography is performed are relevant factors that may act as a roadmap that can guide development communication policy making. This includes but is not limited to age, level of education, gender distribution profile, individual and household income, etc. With the <b>anticipatory</b> objective of <b>policy</b> sciences in relation to crisis or problem solving, the better policy makers get a grasp of how a population is demographically - not just socially - the more sensitive and pro-active policy making as a process can be. When perspectives of an accurate cross-sectional sampling of a population, group, or culture are taken into consideration, the ensuing policies are better geared towards the pre-set objectives. Scalone, Dribe, and Klusener have further found that “Communication can significantly increase the impact of population-relevant policies and other processes of social change…” which reinforces the idea that as a science in itself, development communication policy design, becomes more accurate and purposeful when the correct information and variables are holistically integrated.|$|R
40|$|Adjusting to Europe {{provides}} lively {{coverage of}} the impact of Europe on national policies. With contributions from some of the leading writers on European politics and public policy [...] including Philippe Schmitter, Stanford University; Jeremy Richardson, University of Essex; Helen Wallace, University of Sussex; and Giandomenico Majone, European University Institute, Florence [...] the volume delivers an exciting analysis of the policy-making process. The notion of the European Union is paradoxical: its regulatory powers are immense but its redistributive functions are negligible; its decisions penetrate all aspects of economic and social life, yet Brussels has no local administration or tribunals and no controllers capable of guaranteeing the correct and faithful implementation of the regulations. Exploring the means through which this paradox is confronted, Adjusting to Europe examines the nature of policy-making at Community level and discusses the implications of the specific nature of European institutions for bargaining group mobilization and policy style. It then studies how the three major nation states have adjusted their policy processes and institutions to the European challenges. Finally, it considers the impact of community decisions in three areas: industrial, competition and social policy. Library of Congress subject headings for this publication: Political planning.
