5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions.

Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after <b>aborting</b> the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aborts</b> {{during the}} {{critical}} ascent flight phase require {{the design and}} operation of Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) systems {{to escape from the}} Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) and return the crew safely to the Earth.

40|$|For human spaceflight missions, {{a launch}} vehicle failure poses the {{challenge}} of returning the crew safely to earth through environments that are often much more stressful than the nominal mission. Manned spaceflight vehicles require continuous <b>abort</b> capability throughout the ascent trajectory to protect the crew {{in the event of}} a failure of the launch vehicle. To provide continuous <b>abort</b> coverage during the ascent trajectory, different types of Orion <b>abort</b> modes have been developed. If a launch vehicle failure occurs, the crew must be able to quickly and accurately determine the appropriate <b>abort</b> mode to execute. Early in the ascent, while the Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS) is attached, <b>abort</b> mode selection is trivial, and any failures will result in a LAS <b>abort.</b> For failures after LAS jettison, the Service Module (SM) effectors are employed to perform <b>abort</b> maneuvers. Several different SM <b>abort</b> mode options are available depending on the current vehicle location and energy state. During this region of flight the selection of the <b>abort</b> mode that maximizes the survivability of the crew becomes non-trivial. To provide the most accurate and timely information to the crew and the onboard <b>abort</b> decision logic, on-board algorithms have been developed to propagate the <b>abort</b> trajectories based on the current launch vehicle performance and to predict the current <b>abort</b> capability of the Orion vehicle. This paper will provide an overview of the algorithm architecture for determining <b>abort</b> achievability as well as the scalar integration scheme that makes the onboard computation possible. Extension of the algorithm to assessing <b>abort</b> coverage impacts from Orion design modifications and launch vehicle trajectory modifications is also presented...|$|R

40|$|NASA {{goals are}} set on {{resumption}} {{of human activity}} on the Moon and extending manned missions to Mars. <b>Abort</b> options are key elements of any system designed to safeguard human lives and stated requirements stipulate the provision of an <b>abort</b> capability throughout the mission. The present investigation {{will focus on the}} formulation and analysis of possible <b>abort</b> modes during the Earth departure phase of manned Mars interplanetary transfers. Though of short duration, the departure phase encompasses a mission timeline where failures have frequently become manifest in historical manned spacecraft necessitating the inclusion of a departure phase <b>abort</b> capability. Investigated <b>abort</b> modes included <b>aborts</b> to atmospheric entry, and to Earth or Moon orbit. Considered interplanetary trajectory types included conjunction, opposition, and free-return trajectory classes. All <b>abort</b> modes were analyzed for <b>aborts</b> initiated at multiple points along each of these possible departure trajectories across all launch opportunities of the fifteen-year Earth-Mars inertial period. The consistently low departure velocities of the conjunction trajectories facilitated the greatest <b>abort</b> capability. An analysis of Mars transportation architectures was performed to determine the amount of available delta V inherent in each candidate architecture for executing departure <b>aborts.</b> Results indicate that a delta V of at least 4 km/s is required to achieve a continuous departure phase entry <b>abort</b> capability with <b>abort</b> flights less than three weeks duration for all transfer opportunity years. Less demanding transfer years have a corresponding increase in capability. The Earth orbit <b>abort</b> mode does not become widely achievable until more than 6 km/s delta V is provided; a capacity not manifest in any considered architecture. Optimization of the Moon <b>abort</b> mode resulted in slight departure date shifts to achieve improved lunar alignments. The Moon <b>abort</b> mode is only widely achievable for conjunction transfers during the optimum transfer years and delta V values greater than 4 km/s. A lesser delta V potential of 3 km/s is sufficient to enable entry <b>aborts</b> during the least demanding transfer opportunity years. Extensive <b>abort</b> capability is achievable for high delta V capable Mars architectures. Less propulsively capable architectures achieve moderate <b>abort</b> capability during favorable opportunity years...|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} for the dry suit or BCD inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. If this happens it can cause a runaway ascent {{if it is not}} dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure inflator hose should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a dry suit and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the dry suit inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in <b>aborting</b> the dive.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the <b>Abort</b> Motor thrust profile has been tailored and how optimizing the Concept of Operations on the Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS) of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) aides in getting the crew safely away from a failed Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). Unlike the passive nature of the Apollo system, the Orion Launch <b>Abort</b> Vehicle will be actively controlled, giving the program a more robust <b>abort</b> system with a higher probability of crew survival for an <b>abort</b> at all points throughout the CLV trajectory. By optimizing the concept of operations and thrust profile the Orion program {{will be able to}} take full advantage of the active Orion LAS. Discussion will involve an overview of the development of the <b>abort</b> motor thrust profile and the current <b>abort</b> concept of operations as well as their effects on the performance of LAS <b>aborts.</b> Pad <b>Abort</b> (for performance) and Maximum Drag (for separation from the Launch Vehicle) are the two points that dictate the required thrust and shape of the thrust profile.

The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early.

25|$|The {{unstable}} {{situation in}} Haiti, where elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide had been ousted from office {{by the military}} in September 1991, presented another regional problem. The United States pressured the military government to restore Aristide. In July 1993, the Haitian military regime agreed to reinstate Aristide by October 30, 1993, but then refused to step down. In October, in an effort Clinton approved even though Aspin opposed it, the United States sent the USS Harlan County carrying 200 troops to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Met by a hostile mob of armed Haitians, the ship turned away without attempting to undertake its mission, which the Pentagon described {{as an effort to}} professionalize the Haitian military and undertake civil assistance projects. Some observers attacked Aspin for not taking a harder stand in the administration against an action he opposed and then <b>aborting</b> the effort in the face of local opposition.|$|E
25|$|Along with Jiangxi, Henan {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{unbalanced}} gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, <b>aborting</b> fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.|$|E
