5|$|The final witness {{called for}} the defence was Coventry. He {{was one of the}} non-playing members of the party who had {{witnessed}} no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, knew nothing of Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed that <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was aware, the witnesses had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their claims to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the telegraph {{and the development of}} the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was able. McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not get along with the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles. Bypassing them, he looked for strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin. The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Division {{moved to}} France in March 1916. Berryman became a {{temporary}} captain on 1 April 1916, a rank which became substantive on 10 June 1916. In January 1917, he was posted to the 7th Infantry Brigade as a trainee staff captain. During the Second Battle of Bullecourt he served with 2nd Division headquarters. He {{was appointed to}} command the 18th Field Artillery Battery, and became a temporary major on 1 September 1917, which became substantive on 10 September 1917. This was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go, for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This policy was aimed at giving them {{a broad range of}} experience, which would benefit the Army, while not allowing them to outnumber the available post-war positions.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position {{in order to keep}} contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E

5|$|Kamara {{secured a}} {{play-off}} spot {{with a final}} day victory over Hull City, before City defeated Blackpool in the play-off semi-finals. The final against Notts County was City's first game at Wembley. Goals from Des Hamilton and Mark Stallard gave them a 2–0 win, which secured promotion to Division One. Kamara used 42players in 1996–97 when City avoided relegation with a 3–0 victory in the final game against Queens Park Rangers. Kamara was sacked in January 1998 after an FA Cup defeat to Manchester City, when Richmond claimed the manager had taken the club <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. Richmond again elevated from within and Paul Jewell, who {{had been at the}} club since 1988, was installed as manager, originally on a caretaker basis. He was appointed full-time in May 1998 and Richmond backed his new appointment with a multi-million transfer budget. Jewell signed strikers Lee Mills, from Port Vale and Isaiah Rankin, from Arsenal, for £1million and £1.3million respectively, and signed former captain Stuart McCall from Rangers on a free transfer to lead the side. Despite a poor start, the club secured promotion to the top division {{for the first time in}} 77years with a 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final game of the 1998–99 season.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2016/2017 season late, at the Shanghai Masters. In the first round, he {{defeated}} Liang Wenbo 5–4 after recovering from 1–4 down. It {{was his first}} professional tournament match in five months. However, this was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> progressed, as {{in the second round}} he lost by 2–5 to Michael Holt. Competing in the inaugural European Masters, O'Sullivan defeated David Gilbert 4–1 in the first round, Mark Allen 4–2 in the second round, Mark Davis 4–1 in the quarterfinals and then whitewashed Neil Robertson 6–0 in the semi-final. Facing Judd Trump in the final, O'Sullivan took a 5–3 lead after the first session. In the second session, O'Sullivan further led 8–6 before eventually losing 8–9. In the first of the Home Nations series of tournaments, at the inaugural English Open, O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy Robertson 4–0 in the first round, Zhao Xintong 4–3 in the second, but then lost to Chris Wakelin in the third by 3–4. At the International Championship, O'Sullivan beat Xiao Guodong 6–4 in the first round and Kurt Maflin 6–4 in the second to reach the last 16. However, he was then defeated by Michael Holt 4–6, making this the third consecutive loss to Holt in 2016.|$|E

25|$|In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' {{called a}} maighin digona {{surrounded}} each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied {{according to the}} owner's rank.

25|$|Mrs. Garby was not {{interested}} in further collaboration, so Smith began work on Skylark Three alone. It was published as another three-part serial, in the August to October 1930 issues of Amazing, introduced as the cover story for August. (In 1930, the Smiths were living in Michigan, at 33 Rippon Avenue in Hillsdale.) This was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had planned to take the Skylark series; it was praised in Amazings letter column, and he was paid ¢ per word, surpassing Amazings previous record of half a cent.|$|E
25|$|During the 2003 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of tax reduction and decreased government involvement in the private sector. The party won 28 seats, while the NDP won 30 seats. The party was accused of having undisclosed plans to privatize the province's crown corporations. Hermanson stated he would not sell the four major crown corporations, but would consider offers. The NDP used the ambiguity in the Saskatchewan Party's position to turn the election into a referendum on crown corporation ownership for many voters, and won the one seat it needed to regain a majority government. Hermanson resigned as leader shortly afterward. He stated he had taken the party <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, and {{it was time for the}} party to elect a new leader who could take it further.|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E

50|$|As Masters had hoped, {{the lure}} of her {{daughter}} brought Lili out of hiding. She speaks to her daughter during a performance of Ed Purdy's Wild West Show without identifying herself, and Masters spots her. The two have an intense confrontation in a bar, ending with Masters slamming a full bottle of brandy {{down in front of}} Lili and telling her that she needs to decide whether the booze or her child is more important to her; but that if she doesn't pull herself together, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> concerned she is dead to him. Lili quits drinking and goes into training to seek a position in the new Matt Masters Circus, then in winter quarters near Madrid.|$|R
25|$|Their Champions League ambitions {{were also}} ended {{following}} a defeat and a draw against Arsenal which saw them finish bottom of their group. Once again, {{it had been}} English opposition that had thwarted Roma in Europe. Roma lost the Coppa Italia final to Milan, with Capello particularly angered by supporters who waved banners calling on him to go. Capello's final year at Roma began well with the team playing much better football. They went on a seven-game winning streak before Christmas, including comfortable victories over Juventus and Internazionale. This led to speculation linking him with Juventus, despite his past differences with Luciano Moggi. Capello believed he had taken Roma <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, and began to seriously considered a move. In the run-in, the club's form dipped and they ended up finishing 11 points behind champions Milan.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin.

He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying that <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was concerned he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E

Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress (Elizabeth Berkley) is actually a minor.|$|E
