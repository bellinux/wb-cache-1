Additionally, the flexibility allows {{the user to}} fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority of flexible keyboards in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water and dust proof, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> feature especially in hospitals where keyboards are subjected to frequent washing. For connection with the computer the keyboards use a USB cable, and operating system support reaches {{as far back as}} Windows 2000.|$|E

It has a large arroyo, which {{at the point where}} we crossed it carried a good stream of fresh and good water, which, after running a little way, formed in pools in some large patches of tules." [...] On the return journey to San Diego, the party used the campsite again, on January 20.|$|E
500|$|Andy confronts Dwight and {{challenges}} {{him to a}} [...] "duel" [...] in the parking lot, with Angela as a prize to the winner. Dwight accepts and Angela, anxious to avoid making a choice {{between the two men}} herself, says she will honor the results of the duel. Jim, acting as office manager in Michael's absence, tries to talk them out of the duel and confiscates Dwight's hidden weapons around the office, but concedes he does not have the power to prevent a fight outside the office. Meanwhile in New York, Michael is nervous about why David Wallace wants to meet with him. But as the meeting begins, David tells him Scranton is the most successful Dunder Mifflin branch amid a difficult economic climate, and he wants to learn why Michael's management has been so successful. Michael is delighted with the compliment and attention, but can only manage vague, off-topic and largely nonsensical answers. David claims it is difficult for someone to make a self-evaluation, and Michael leaves the meeting in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> mood.|$|E

500|$|Workman {{was born}} January 8, 1859, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to a wealthy and elite family {{descended from the}} Pilgrims; she was the {{youngest}} of three children. Her mother was Elvira Hazard, and her father was Alexander H. Bullock, businessman and Republican Massachusetts governor. Fanny was educated by governesses before attending Miss Graham's Finishing School in New York City, after which she spent time in Paris, and then Dresden. Thomas Pauly writes in his short biography of Workman that [...] "early on Fanny chafed at the constraints of her privilege". [...] A small number of her stories from this time survive, describing her interest in adventure. In one, [...] "A Vacation Episode", she describes a beautiful and aristocratic English girl who is contemptuous of society. She runs away to Grindelwald, becoming an excellent alpinist and marrying an American. The story encapsulates much of Fanny's own life: wanderlust, a love of the mountains, and a commitment to women's rights. [...] In 1886, she published a short story, set during the First Indian War, in New York Magazine about [...] "the capture and rescue of a white girl"; a reviewer of the story stated that it was [...] "told in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> and infatuating style".|$|E
500|$|Anurag Basu's Barfi!, with Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz, was {{her final}} {{appearance}} of 2012. Set in the 1970s, the film {{tells the story}} of three people, two of whom are physically disabled. Chopra played Jhilmil Chatterjee, an autistic woman who {{falls in love with a}} deaf, mute man (Kapoor). Rituparno Ghosh, an acclaimed director, considered it a [...] "very, very brave" [...] role to accept given how demanding it is for an actor to convincingly portray a woman with autism. To prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people. The film received rave reviews from film critics and was a major commercial success, earning [...] worldwide. Chopra received unanimous praise for her portrayal, which several reviewers regarded as her best performance at that time. The Indo-Asian News Service review said, [...] "Priyanka Chopra as the autistic Jhilmil steals the show from Ranbir, if that's possible. Her inherent glamorous personality simply disappears into her character. We don't see the actress on screen at all! We see only Jhilmil who reminds us in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> way of Sridevi in Sadma. This is one of the most flawless interpretations of a physical-psychological disability seen on celluloid." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph noted Ranbir and Priyanka turn in two of the finest performances seen on the Indian screen. Chopra received Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, IIFA and Producers Guild Film Awards. The film was chosen as India's entry for the 85th Academy Awards. Don 2, Agneepath and Barfi! ranked among the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time up until then.|$|E
500|$|From 1864 onwards, the Hurva Synagogue was {{considered}} the most beautiful and most important synagogue in the Land of Israel. It was described as [...] "the glory of the Old City" [...] and the [...] "most striking edifice in all of Palestine". It also housed part of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, the largest yeshiva in Jerusalem. It was a focal point of Jewish spiritual life {{in the city and}} was the site of the installation of the Ashkenazic chief rabbis of both Palestine and Jerusalem. On his visit to Jerusalem in 1866, Moses Montefiore went to the synagogue, placing a silver breastplate on one of the Torah scrolls. When he visited again in 1875, a crowd of 3,000 Jews turned out to greet him. On February 3, 1901 a memorial service for Queen Victoria took place inside the synagogue in gratitude for the protection afforded to the Jews of Jerusalem by Britain. The service was presided over by the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Shmuel Salant. According to a report in The Jewish Chronicle, the large building was [...] "filled to its utmost capacity and policemen had to keep off the crowds, who vainly sought admission, by force". In around 1919, Benjamin Lee Gordon wrote that the [...] "synagogue presented <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> and dignified appearance. It was well illuminated with artistic lamps presented by a certain Mr. Lichtenstein, of Philadelphia". In 1921 Abraham Isaac Kook was appointed first Chief Rabbi of Palestine at the synagogue. The synagogue also hosted Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel, who was honoured with reciting a portion of the Torah. In 1923 Yosef Shalom Eliashiv's bar mitzvah was held at the synagogue. [...] In the 1930s and possibly earlier, the synagogue housed the Chayei Olam Cheider, where indigent students form the Old City received their Torah education.|$|E
