5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of <b>a</b> <b>mature</b> female, <b>a</b> <b>mature</b> male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
5|$|The {{emperor penguin}} {{is a social}} animal in its nesting and its {{foraging}} behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing. Individuals may be active day or night. <b>A</b> <b>mature</b> adult travels {{throughout most of the}} year between the nesting area and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March.|$|E

5|$|Albatrosses live {{much longer}} than other birds; they delay {{breeding}} for longer and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as <b>a</b> <b>mature</b> adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old.

5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters.

Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus is {{a patron}} saint of Hungary, {{especially}} along the borders. In particular, soldiers and the Székely people venerate him. A late medieval legend says that Ladislaus appeared {{at the head of}} a Székely army fighting against and routing a plundering band of Tatars in 1345. He is also called upon during times of pestilence. He is often depicted as <b>a</b> <b>mature,</b> bearded man wearing a royal crown and holding a long sword or banner. He is also shown on his knees before a deer, or in the company of two angels.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the long period of neglect of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain <b>a</b> <b>mature,</b> individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and tonal design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which <b>a</b> <b>mature</b> egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|South Park is an American adult {{animated}} sitcom {{created by}} Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network. The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures {{in and around}} the titular Colorado town. Much like The Simpsons, South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards <b>a</b> <b>mature</b> audience.|$|E

For non maturity assets (such as overdrafts, credit card balances, drawn and undrawn lines of credit or any other off-balance sheet commitments), their movements as well as volume can be predict by making assumptions derived from examining historic data on client's behaviour.|$|R

The original manga's creator Masamune Shirow was the main designer of the characters and mecha for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} caste of <b>a</b> <b>mature</b> colony {{includes a}} fertile female and male, {{known as the}} queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king mates with her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates {{at a certain time}} of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators.|$|E
