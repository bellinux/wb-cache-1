5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. <b>A</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|The Whitefield society {{arranged}} for funds to be pooled to buy books for communal use, enabling the 16-year-old Horsefield to read James Lee's 1760 work, An Introduction to Botany. It provided information on Linnaean taxonomy as it applied to plants, and from it Horsefield copied details onto <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> he pinned to his loom to commit them to memory {{while he was}} working. He earned the respect of other botanists for his abilities {{in the sphere of}} collection and identification of species and was the first to find the Entosthodon templetoni moss in England.|$|E

A {{number of these}} folded pages would then be stacked and bound together by applying glue to the creased edges, the front page, and the back page, then mounting the glued surfaces with a cover made from <b>a</b> continuous <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> This binding method was used primarily for hand-copied manuscripts.|$|R

5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent on <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl holds up <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June he {{made his}} first {{official}} observer qualifying sortie which he passed. At this time the German Luftstreitkräfte (Air Service) introduced the Fokker Eindecker fighter equipped with Synchronization gear. Firing through the propeller, the Germans had a machine that soon became a serious threat to McCudden's unit. The enemy succeeded establishing a period of air superiority at this time. McCudden still flew regularly as an observer with the new commanding Officer, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, who had taken over command on 20 November 1915. He recorded a flight of 2 hours 40 minutes on the 27 November which included an abortive chase after a Albatros C.I reconnaissance aircraft. On 16 December 1915 he acted as aerial gunner, when he drove off an attack on his flight by the German ace Max Immelmann. While firing at the Fokker, McCudden witnessed <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or fabric fall off the German machine. Although the ground was diligently searched, no trace of it was found. On 19 January 1916, McCudden exchanged fire with another German observer without result.|$|E

5|$|The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell {{that she}} needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she should try to convert her {{grandmother}} Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is supposed to be at King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that they have already lost and blames the Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of a transit of Venus {{was made by}} Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston in England, on 4 December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar then in use in England). His friend, William Crabtree, also observed this transit from Broughton, near Manchester. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler's calculation for the orbit of Venus, realized that transits of Venus would occur in pairs 8 years apart, and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks focused {{the image of the}} Sun through a simple telescope onto <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> where the image could be safely observed. After observing for most of the day, he was lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, just half an hour before sunset. Horrocks's observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus, as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun— the astronomical unit. He estimated that distance to be 59.4millionmiles (95.6Gm, 0.639AU)– about two thirds of the actual distance of 93millionmiles (149.6 million km), but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time. The observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks's death.|$|E
