5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|There are {{proposals}} to construct monorails in Penang, Johor Bahru, and Malacca but opposition has been vociferously expressed by Penang and Malacca residents concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{being out of}} place in the historic downtown areas. Malacca has since focused on the less intrusive Aerorail. The federal administrative centre of Putrajaya was also supposed to have a monorail network and the main station and several metres of track have been built. However, the project has been postponed because of costs and the Malaysian government felt {{that it was not a}} priority project for the time being even though good public transportation would attract many Malaysians to re-locate to this new underpopulated city.|$|E
25|$|We {{can view}} Ω {{as a measure}} of our lack of {{knowledge}} about a system. As an illustration of this idea, consider a set of 100 coins, each of which is either heads up or tails up. The macrostates are specified {{by the total number of}} heads and tails, whereas the microstates are specified by the facings of each individual coin. For the macrostates of 100 heads or 100 tails, there is exactly one possible configuration, so our knowledge of the system is complete. At the opposite extreme, the macrostate which gives us the least knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> consists of 50 heads and 50 tails in any order, for which there are 100,891,344,545,564,193,334,812,497,256 (100 choose 50) ≈ 1029 possible microstates.|$|E

25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
25|$|Though the Hulse–Taylor {{observations}} were very important, they give only indirect evidence for gravitational waves. A more conclusive observation {{would be a}} direct measurement {{of the effect of}} a passing gravitational wave, which could also provide more information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> that generated it. Any such direct detection is complicated by the extraordinarily small effect the waves would produce on a detector. The amplitude of a spherical wave will fall off as the inverse of the distance from the source (the 1/R term in the formulas for h above). Thus, even waves from extreme systems like merging binary black holes die out to very small amplitudes by the time they reach the Earth. Astrophysicists expect that some gravitational waves passing the Earth may be as large as h ≈ 10−20, but generally no bigger.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} state {{variables are}} the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent {{the entire state}} of the system at any given time. The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, , is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation. If the system is represented in transfer function form, the minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction. It is important to understand that converting a state-space realization to a transfer function form may lose some internal information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> and may provide a description of a system which is stable, when the state-space realization is unstable at certain points. In electric circuits, the number of state variables is often, though not always, the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit such as capacitors and inductors. The state variables defined must be linearly independent, i.e., no state variable can be written as a linear combination of the other state variables or the system {{will not be able to}} be solved.|$|E
