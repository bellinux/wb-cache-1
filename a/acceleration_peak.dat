40|$|Purpose: Aim of {{the paper}} is to propose a new {{approach}} {{for the assessment of}} passive safety of gymnastic equipment that allows technicians to optimize the choice of protection devices. Design/methodology/approach: According to different standard procedures, EN 913 and EN 1177 with an additional control on the acceleration parameter, experimental tests on polymer foam materials were performed using cylindrical and hemispherical missiles connected to a flexible impact testing apparatus realized at Chemnitz University of Technology. Findings: Impact tests carried out using cylindrical and hemispherical missiles have shown, for the same impact energy, different <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak</b> values, always greater for hemispherical missile than cylindrical one. So considering EN 913 procedure, the severity of head impacts, in term of <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak</b> can be underestimated when a cylindrical missile is used. For this reason to correctly assess the head injuries is necessary to take into account in addition to the <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak</b> value, also HIC parameter. Research limitations/implications: The research described in the paper was carried out taking into account only the human head impacts (the most severe injuries) and not other parts of the human body. Practical implications: The new approach proposed in the paper can be useful for the choice of the protective devices to improve the passive safety of gymnastic equipment. It represents a starting point to define new standards. Originality/value: On the base of experimental tests, the authors show that the safety threshold of peak acceleration defined in the EN 913 standard is poor. For this reason it is necessary to modify the current standards, in order to guarantee an adequate passive safety and to allow the technicians to optimize the choice of protection devices on the base of impact absorption properties, that are evaluated using all together the parameters: <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak,</b> drop height and Head Injury Criterion (HIC) ...|$|E

The results in Table  6 show that the PLF, <b>peak</b> <b>acceleration</b> and <b>peak</b> velocity for the third lifts reduced as the subjects gained some experience and learned through three repeated manipulation. However, the reductions in PLF, <b>peak</b> <b>acceleration</b> and <b>peak</b> velocity were small, which indicate that the effects of weight illusion were not mitigated even after the human had gained experience when manipulating objects with the PARS.

DESIGN: A prospective case control study of patients with medial compartment OA of the knee. SETTING: Gait analysis laboratory in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six medial compartment knees with OA of 23 patients with bilateral disease and 38 knees of 19 age-matched healthy subjects as controls. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the peak external adduction moment at the knee during the stance phase of gait and the first <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak</b> after heel strike at the lateral side of the femoral condyles. Kellgren and Lawrence grading system was used for radiographic assessment of OA severity. RESULTS: The mean value of peak external adduction moment of the knee was higher in OA knees than the control. Application of lateral wedged insoles significantly reduced the peak external adduction moment in Kellgren-Lawrence grades I and II knee OA patients. The first <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak</b> value after heel strike in these patients was relatively high compared with the control. Application of lateral wedged insoles significantly reduced the first <b>acceleration</b> <b>peak</b> in Kellgren-Lawrence grades I and II knee OA patients. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetic and kinematic effects of wearing of lateral wedged insoles were significant in Kellgren-Lawrence grades I and II knee OA.

Humans make smooth pursuit eye movements {{to bring the}} image of a moving object onto the fovea. Although pursuit accuracy is critical to prevent motion blur, the eye often falls behind the target. Previous studies suggest that pursuit accuracy differs between motion directions. Here, we systematically assess asymmetries in smooth pursuit. METHODS.

We analyzed pursuit latency, <b>acceleration,</b> <b>peak</b> velocity, gain, and catch-up saccade latency, number, and amplitude.

40|$|In many applications, {{kinematic}} {{structures are}} used to enable and disable degrees of freedom. The relative movement between a wheel and {{the body of a}} car or a landing gear and an aircraft fuselage are examples for a defined movement. In most cases, a spring-damper system determines the kinetic properties of the movement. However, unexpected high load peaks may lead to maximum displacements and maybe to locking. Thus, a hard clash between two rigid components may occur, causing <b>acceleration</b> <b>peaks.</b> This may have harmful effects for the whole system. For example a hard landing of an aircraft can result in locking the landing gear and thus damage the entire aircraft. In this paper, the potential of adaptive auxiliary kinematic guidance elements in a spring-damper system to prevent locking is investigated numerically. The aim is to provide additional forces in the auxiliary kinematic guidance elements in case of overloading the spring-damper system and thus to absorb some of the impact energy. To estimate the potential of the load redistribution in the spring-damper system, a numerical model of a two-mass oscillator is used, similar to a quarter-car-model. In numerical calculations, the reduction of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>peaks</b> of the masses with the adaptive approach is compared to the <b>Acceleration</b> <b>peaks</b> without the approach, or, respectively, when locking is not prevented. In addition, the required force of the adaptive auxiliary kinematic guidance elements is calculated {{as a function of the}} masses of the system and the drop height, or, respectively, the impact energy...|$|R
40|$|This part {{presents}} a dynamic model for predicting the impact compressive responses of warp-knitted spacer fabrics under various loading conditions using quasi-static compressive stress–strain data. The model was established {{based on a}} nonlinear mass-spring-damper system by considering spacer yarns as nonlinear springs with damping effect and representation of their stiffness by the constitutive model developed in Part I. Based on the dynamic model, the impact compressive responses of a typical warp-knitted spacer fabric was parametrically studied in terms of damping ratio, initial velocity, striker mass and contact area. The study indicates that damping can reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>acceleration</b> and <b>peak</b> displacement regardless of loading conditions, and the increase of the initial velocity can enhance the damping effect. Increasing initial velocity or striker mass while keeping the counterpart constant can increase the <b>peak</b> <b>acceleration</b> and <b>peak</b> displacement. However, at a constant kinetic energy, either increasing striker mass or decreasing initial velocity can reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>acceleration,</b> but the <b>peak</b> displacement keeps constant. The study also shows that an optimal size of the spacer fabric exists for achieving minimal <b>peak</b> <b>acceleration</b> under impact at a certain kinetic energy. Experimental validation by drop-weight impact tests demonstrates that the predictions of the dynamic model are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. Using the quasi-static compressive data from a simple test, this dynamic model can numerically simulate the full time-response of warp-knitted spacer fabrics under various impact conditions.

The mechanisms underlying this diabetic cardiomyopathy are largely unknown, but may involve altered myocardial energy metabolism. We assessed myocardial systolic and diastolic function and HEP metabolism in 12 asymptomatic normotensive male patients with recently diagnosed, well-controlled type 2 diabetes and 12 controls, using MR imaging and phosphorus- 31 -nuclear MR spectroscopy (31 P-MRS) on a 1. 5 T clinical scanner; 31 P-MR spectra were quantified, and myocardial HEP metabolism was expressed as phosphocreatine to adenosine-triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratio.
