5|$|When it was {{announced}} that the wing would be restructured and Otis <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> Base would remain open, discussions began {{about the future of the}} 102d. Staff of the 102d and those at Massachusetts <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> headquarters considered a plan centered on the idea that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission to support the growing War on Terror. The idea hit a roadblock when it {{was announced}} that the funds which the wing could use to convert into its new mission had been depleted.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard's</b> main {{tool for}} {{fighting}} forest fires is the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS), which has undergone several updates since its first use in September 1971 by the California <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard's</b> then-146th Tactical Airlift Wing and the North Carolina <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard's</b> then-145th Tactical Airlift Group. [...] Housed in C-130s, MAFFS could disperse up to 27,000 pounds...almost 3,000 gallons...of commercial fire retardants or an equivalent amount of water. Newer aircraft like the C-130J carry the MAFFS II, which carry even more fire retardant, can disperse it more rapidly over a wider area, and {{is easier to}} recharge after a mission than its predecessor.|$|R

5|$|In May 1968, Bush was {{commissioned}} into the Texas <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard.</b> After {{two years of}} active-duty service while training, {{he was assigned to}} Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing {{as a member of the}} House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> service, which remain in its official archives.|$|E
