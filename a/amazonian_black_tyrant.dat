40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of biochar technology for soil amendment is {{largely based on}} evidence about soil fertility and crop productivity gains made in the <b>Amazonian</b> <b>Black</b> Earth (terra preta). However, the uncertainty of production gains at realistic application rates of biochars and {{lack of knowledge about}} other benefits and other concerns may have resulted in poor uptake of biochar technology in Australia so far. In this review, we identify important opportunities as well as challenges in the adoption of biochar technology for broadacre farming and other sectors in Australia. The paper highlights that for biochar technology to be cost-effective and successful, we need to look beyond carbon sequestration and explore other opportunities to value-add to biochar. Therefore, some emerging and novel applications of biochar are identified. We also suggest some priority research areas that need immediate attention in order to realise the full potential of biochar technology in agriculture and other sectors in Australia...|$|R

5000|$|Constable Ichabod Crane {{serves as}} the protagonist in the 1999 film {{adaptation}} of Sleepy Hollow, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. In this interpretation, he is a New York City policeman {{with an interest in}} Forensic science sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of grisly murders to prove the merits of his style of the investigation after he argues against the police's current methods. As in the original story, his horse is named Gunpowder. Ichabod's most notable traits in the movie include an ahead-of-his-time liking for post-mortem examinations, deduction, and scientific methods, as well as his being very quirky, skittish, and being disturbed by death and blood, despite his occupation. His backstory is also explored: when he was seven his mother, an [...] "innocent child of Nature" [...] was [...] "murdered to save her soul" [...] by his father, [...] "a Bible <b>black</b> <b>tyrant</b> behind a mask of righteousness" [...] which led to a loss of faith for him. It is Ichabod who finally banishes the Hessian Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) to Hell and sends Lady van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), the woman who has been controlling the undead rider, with him. Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is seen {{at the end of the}} movie going back to New York with Ichabod, along with a boy who helped him in the investigation. Brom Bones (Casper Van Dien), who at one point does disguise himself as the Horseman and throws a pumpkin at Ichabod, is killed by the real Horseman halfway in the film.|$|R

No,--at last you find three deep of fictitious farmers, and you find the European gentlemen, high in place and authority, the real farmers of the settlement. So that the zemindars were dispossessed, the country racked and ruined, for the benefit of an European, under the name of a farmer: for you will easily judge whether these gentlemen had fallen so deeply in love with the banians, and thought so highly of their merits and services, as to reward them with all the possessions of the great landed interest of the country. Your Lordships are too grave, wise, and discerning, to make it necessary for me to say more upon that subject.

40|$|A região amazônica apresenta grande quantidade de ambientes aquáticos influenciados pelo pulso de inundação, nos quais se observa uma elevada riqueza de organismos aquáticos, entre os quais destacam-se as desmídias, organismos favorecidos pelas características das águas pretas amazônicas que apresentam reduzidos valores de pH e de condutividade elétrica. Este trabalho teve por objetivo realizar um inventário taxonômico das desmídias da região limnética do lago Cutiuaú, um lago de inundação de águas pretas localizado no Parque Nacional do Jaú, em diferentes períodos do ciclo hidrológico, dos anos de 2002 - 2004, e verificar a influência dos períodos do ciclo hidrológico na riqueza específica de desmídias. Para tanto, foram coletadas 109 amostras com rede de plâncton com 25 &# 956;m de abertura de malha em 10 estações de amostragens. As amostras foram fixadas com solução Transeau e observadas posteriormente em microscópio óptico. No momento das coletas foram medidos os valores de profundidade, temperatura da água, condutividade elétrica e transparência da água. O ambiente estudado caracterizou-se por apresentar uma grande variação de profundidade, baixos valores de pH e condutividade elétrica e elevados valores de temperatura da água (27, 0 - 31, 7 °C). Foram identificados 105 táxons de desmídias, sendo 73 % identificados em nível específico e 27 % em nível infraespecífico. A família Desmidiaceae foi a que apresentou maior riqueza de espécies, 85, acompanhada da família Closteriaceae com 17 espécies e a família Gonatozygaceae apenas uma. O gênero Staurastrum Meyen foi o que apresentou o maior número de espécies, 19, seguido por Staurodesmus Teiling com 13, Euastrum Ehrenberg e Micrasterias Agardh com 10 espécies cada. Temporalmente o período de enchente apresentou o maior número de táxons, 98, seguido pelo período de vazante com 51 táxons. O período de águas altas presentou 39 táxons e o período de águas baixas 23. Das 105 espécies registradas para este estudo 26 são primeira citação de ocorrência para o estado do Amazonas. The Amazon has a {{great amount}} of aquatic environments, {{influenced}} by the floodpulse, in which high richness of aquatic organisms is observed, in special the Desmids, organisms that are present in phytoplankton, favored by the characteristics of the <b>Amazonian</b> <b>black</b> water, which is lightly acid with reduced pH values and electric conductivity. This work presents a taxonomic survey of planktonic desmids of the Cutiuaú lake in National Park of Jaú in some periods of the floodpulse of Jaú River between the years of 2002 - 2004, and also verified the influence of these periods in the species richness of desmids. 109 samples were collected in ten stations of the Cutiuaú lake with a 25 &# 956;m mesh plankton net and fixed with Transeau solution. In the moment of the sampling, limnological parameters such as depth, temperature, electric conductivity and transparency of the water were measured. The environment was characterized by depth values among 2. 4 to 11. 5 meters. The temperature of the water in the stations ranged between 27 - 31. 7 °C. The pH oscillated from 3. 3 to 5. 2. The electric conductivity ranged from 10. 8 to 68. 7 &# 956;S. cm- 1. The values of saturation of dissolved oxygen oscillated among 6. 8 and 68. 7 %. The transparency of the water, measured with a Secchi disk, oscillated between 0. 6 - 1. 3 meters. 105 taxa of desmids were identified and described, being 73 % idenfified in specific level and 27 % in infraspecifc level. The Desmidiaceae family showed a great richness with 85 taxa registerd, followed by Closteriaceae family with 17 taxa and Gonatozygaceae Family with one taxa. The genus Staurastrum Meyen belonging to the family Desmidiaceae, presented the largest number of species with 19 species, followed by Staurodesmus Teiling with 13, Euastrum Ehrenberg and Micrasterias Agardh with ten taxa each. The water level fluctuations may influence the richness of desmids species. In the increasing water level, the largest number of taxa was registered (98 species). In the decreasing water level 51 taxa were identified, in the high water level, 39 species and 23 registered taxa in the low water level. Of the 105 species registered for this study, 26 are considered as first citations of ocurrence of the species for the state of Amazonas...|$|R
