5000|$|These systems {{depend on}} the proper {{operation}} of thermostatic <b>air-venting</b> valves located on radiators throughout the heated area. When {{the system is not}} in use, these valves are open to the atmosphere, and radiators and pipes contain air. When a heating cycle begins, the boiler produces steam, which expands and displaces the air in the system. The air exits the system through the <b>air-venting</b> valves on the radiators and on the steam pipes themselves. The thermostatic valves close when they become hot; in the most common kind, the vapor pressure of a small amount of alcohol in the valve exerts the force to actuate the valve and prevent steam from leaving the radiator. When the valve cools, air enters the system to replace the condensing steam.|$|E

40|$|The AMRA {{lysimeter}} station (near Piana di Monte Verna, Caserta, Italy) {{consists of}} eight weighable monolithic groundwater lysimeters fully equipped with sensors to provide continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, water tension and weight, {{as well as}} ports for soil, liquid and gas sampling. An air-injection system allows to perform venting or sparging actions into contaminated soils and groundwater. A meteo station provides the indispensable data to evaluate the interactions between lysimeters and the meteorological phenomena on site. A preliminary experiment was performed last year to investigate the reactive transport of a NAPL-type contaminant under passive transport conditions and during an <b>air-venting</b> remediation action. 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane (isooctane) was chosen as a representative contaminant from gasoline fuels. Four lysimeters containing undisturbed soil extracted from a former industrial site were used. Surface vegetation was cut to avoid leaves interference during contamination phase. Two lysimeters were contaminated by distributing a fixed amount of isooctane onto the soil surface, while two more lysimeters were left uncontaminated for reference. Only {{for one of the}} two contaminated lysimeters air was vented through a port at 150 cm depth. Air injection started 30 min after the contamination, lasted all the experiment time, and was applied also to one of the reference lysimeters. Gas samples were drawn periodically at different depths of the two contaminated lysimeters and analysed for isooctane content. Evolution of isooctane concentration profiles was different in the two contaminated lysimeters. In case of <b>air-venting</b> the contaminant maximum concentration was lower and the maximum depth reached by the contaminant was reduced. The time needed for a complete remediation action was compared with theoretical estimates computed according to normative procedures...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a theory {{for the removal}} of volatile organic chemicals from an unsaturated soil stratum consisting of highly porous coarse sand layers sandwiching a thin and semipervious lens. Each soil layer is modelled as a periodic array of spherical aggregates formed by solid grains and immobile water trapped by surface tension. Volatile chemicals are vaporized in the mobile air in pores between aggregates, dissolved in the intra-aggregate water, and adsorbed on the surface of soil grains. Using the effective transport equations derived for the aggregated soils, we consider shallow layers with sharp contrast in physical properties. An asymptotic analysis is developed for an axisymmetric geometry, yielding quasi-one-dimensional governing equations for individual layers. At the leading order the flow and the vapour transport are horizontal in the coarse layers but vertical in the semipervious lens. Numerical results are presented for a simple example to demonstrate the significance of the lens permeability, diffusivity and retardation factor, and the aggregate diffusivity in the coarse layers, on the vapour transport during the stages of contamination and <b>air-venting.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in flattening-filter-free (FFF) linear accelerators. Removal of the filter results in available dose rates up to 24 Gy min(- 1) (for nominal energy 10 MV in depth of maximum dose, a source-surface distance of 100 cm and a field size of 10 × 10 cm 2). To guarantee accurate relative and reference dosimetry for the FFF beams, we investigated the charge collection efficiency of multiple <b>air-vented</b> and one liquid ionization chamber for dose rates up to 31. 9 Gy min(- 1). For flattened beams, the ion-collection efficiency of all <b>air-vented</b> ionization chambers (except for the PinPoint chamber) was above 0. 995. By removing the flattening filter, we found a reduction in collection efficiency of approximately 0. 5 - 0. 9 % for a 10 MV beam. For FFF beams, the Markus chamber showed the largest collection efficiency of 0. 994. The observed collection efficiencies were dependent on dose per pulse, but independent of the pulse repetition frequency. Using the liquid ionization chamber, the ion-collection efficiency for flattened beams was above 0. 990 for all dose rates. However, this chamber showed a low collection efficiency of 0. 940 for the FFF 10 MV beam at a dose rate of 31. 9 Gy min(- 1). All investigated <b>air-vented</b> ionization chambers can be reliably used for relative dosimetry of FFF beams. The order of correction for reference dosimetry is given in the manuscript. Due to their increased saturation in high dose rate FFF beams, liquid ionization chambers appear to be unsuitable for dosimetry within these contexts...|$|R

Receiving antenna of finite dimensions could significantly change the EM field distribution inside the enclosure and thus affect the results for SE.

40|$|International audiencePosition-specific isotope effects (PSIEs) {{have been}} {{measured}} by isotope ratio monitoring C- 13 {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectrometry during the evaporation of 10 liquids of different polarities under 4 evaporation modes (passive evaporation, <b>air-vented</b> evaporation, low pressure evaporation, distillation). The observed effects are {{used to assess the}} validity of the Craig-Gordon isotope model for organic liquids. For seven liquids the overall isotope effect (IE) includes a vapor-liquid contribution that is strongly position specific in polar compounds but less so in apolar compounds and a diffusive IE that is not position-specific, except in the alcohols, ethanol and propan- 1 -ol. The diffusive IE is diminished under forced evaporation. The position-specific isotope pattern created by liquid-vapor IEs is manifest in five liquids, which have an air-side limitation for volatilization. For the alcohols, undefined processes in the liquid phase create additional PSIEs. Three other liquids with limitations on the liquid side have a lower, highly position-specific, bulk diffusive IE. It is concluded that evaporation of organic pollutants creates unique position-specific isotope patterns that may be used to assess the progress of remediation or natural attenuation of pollution and that the Craig-Gordon isotope model is valid for the volatilization of nonpolar organic liquids with air-side limitation of the volatilization rate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} position-specific isotope effects (IE) {{measured by}} iq 13 C-NMR during the evaporation of 8 different liquids of different polarities under 4 evaporation modes (passive evaporation, <b>air-vented</b> evaporation, low pressure evaporation and distillation). The observed effects {{are used to}} assess the question whether for carbon isotopes in organic liquids the use of the Craig-Gordon isotope model is valid. It is shown for five liquids that the overall IE include vapour-liquid IE which are strongly position-specific in polar compounds and less specific in apolar compounds, and a diffusive effect for which is not position-specific. The diffusive effect is diminished under wind and low pressure. After evaporation, the position-specific isotope pattern created by liquid-vapour IE is still quite reasonably preserved in these five liquids, which have, like water, an air-side limitation for volatilisation. Three other liquids in this study with limitations rather or fully on the liquid side differed from this pattern. It is concluded that evaporation of organic pollutants creates a unique position-specific isotope pattern that may be {{used to assess the}} progress of remediation or natural attenuation, and that the Craig-Gordon isotope model is valid for the volatilization of organic liquids with air-side limitation of the volatilization rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the air cushion pressure {{control of the}} 140 m Techno Super Liner (TSL), which Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (MES) has constructed. TSL is an air-supported catamaran ship, which contains pressurized air between rigid side hulls. The ship dynamic performance is investigated through simulations, for the first, {{which is based on}} 3 DOF motion (Heave/Pitch/Roll) and air cushion dynamics. It was performed for both model and full scale in various wave headings. The scale effect is discussed through simulation results. Then, the results of towing model tests in both regular and irregular waves are described. The model is equipped with lift fans and all the tests are carried out under the on/cushion conditions. The results of model scale simulations and model tests are compared and verified. With these results from the simulations and model tests, the design of the air cushion control system is discussed in terms of the fan stability and ship vertical accelerations. The basic concept of <b>air-vent</b> louver control is presented. As for the sea trial of the ship, it was successfully completed on October 12, 2005.

However, few improvements {{have been made to}} the overall design of dryers since the 1970 s. For this reason, energy efficiency research in domestic clothes dryers is a promising topic. In order to effectively and accurately research and test efficiency and design of new prototypes of the dryer, a mathematical model of the <b>air-vented,</b> residential dryer was created in the Energy Systems Lab at Western Kentucky University, using the text-based environment of MATLAB. This model was developed and simulated using numerical solver techniques. This model characterizes the multi-physics nature of the drying process, specifically its heat and mass transfer equations.

This thesis adapts the model from the MATLAB environment into a new modeling software, Dymola, which is object-oriented and will be used {{for the future of the}} lab. The Dymola model is simulated and its results are compared to both the MATLAB model and experimental data. This model provides a foundation not only for further research on the clothes dryer and other appliances but also for modeling and simulation of a myriad of complex, multi-physics systems.

It was Antoni Amat, the technical director of Inducar (Industrias de la Carrocería) i.e. an external provider for SEAT, the man who conceived the idea of proposing the whole project to SEAT with the mediation of Günter Óistrach, after the former's visit and contacts at the Turin Motor Show, with the Terrassa-based Inducar company undertaking from SEAT {{the production of the}} chassis for its SEAT 1200 Sport car. The purchased rights Nergal design had been sublimed to modifications in a mixture of elements with another Sessano's concept car i.e. the OTAS KL112, in order to fit in with the underpinnings meant to be used by SEAT, as it was based upon the ones of a Fiat 127. However the remainings of the original NSU Nergal design were still present in the SEAT production model: the <b>air-vents</b> in the third pillar just above the rear wheel arch were likely indicating the presence of the rear-mounted engine in NSU's donor design. In fact though SEAT's engineers first examined the possibility to keep the rear-engine layout in the SEAT 1200 Sport, they made the final choice in favor of a front-engined one. Its boot featured a remote opening through a handle on to driver's door and had a capacity of 339 litres.|$|R
60|$|The sketch {{represents}} {{a section of}} the pack-saddle, at the place where one of the hooks is situated on either side, but the front of the kegs themselves, and not their section, is given. Above and between the kegs lies a bag, and a strap passing from the near side of the saddle goes over the whole burden, and is buckled to a similar short strap on the other side. It is of importance that the bung-hole should be placed even nearer to the rim than where it is drawn, for it is necessary that it should be convenient to pour out of and to pour into, and that it should be placed on the highest part of the keg, both when on the beast's back and also when it stands on the ground, lest water should leak and be lost. According to the above plan, when water is ladled into it, the rim keeps it from spilling; and in pouring out water, the run acts as a spout. In making the bung-hole, a metal plate, with a screw-hole in it, is firmly fixed {{in the face of the}} cask; into this a wooden stopper, bound with iron, is made to screw (natives would probably steal a metal one). The stopper has a small head and a deeply-cut neck, by which it is tied to the cask, and its body has a large hole bored in it, which admits of a stick being put through, to prize it round, if it should become jammed. A spigot, to screw into the bung-hole on arriving at camp, might be really useful; but if used, a gimlet-hole must be bored in the cask to act as an <b>air-vent.</b> A large tundish is very convenient, and a spare plug might be taken; but a traveller, with a little painstaking, could soon cut a plug with his own knife, sufficiently well made to allow of its being Firmly screwed in, and of retaining the water, if it had a bit of rag wrapped round it. A piece of rag rolled tightly, will suffice to plug a hole.|$|R
