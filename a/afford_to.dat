Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford, his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke {{and was replaced by}} William Adams.

He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> transport them, and also because he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E

Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E

5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices (usually involving {{animals and}} foodstuffs) to various deities, spirits, and ancestors. Deceased ancestors {{were thought to}} require food and drink in the afterlife, so living family members were routinely obligated to offer food and wine to the ancestors in a family shrine or temple. Wealthy families who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> bury their dead in large tombs often placed the food items at the entrances of such complexes.|$|E

Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
