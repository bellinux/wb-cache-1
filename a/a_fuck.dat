The second verse is delivered by Jay-Z, who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question, [...] "would you rather be underpaid or overrated?" [...] Jay-Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing.|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives <b>a</b> <b>Fuck?,</b> Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'"

[...] In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives <b>a</b> <b>Fuck?,</b> Ice-T wrote that [...] "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks.

Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives <b>a</b> <b>fuck</b> about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are so many great forms of music out there, and you grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Santa Barbara Independent, Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students. The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class. Anderson said it was not {{the use of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from <b>a</b> <b>Fuck</b> for Forest concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy. The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at William Penn High School without previewing it or sending permission slips home to parents. He told the Philadelphia Daily News that before showing the documentary, he was unaware that it contained the clip showing sexual intercourse. He was dismissed from his position by the school principal, and his termination was upheld by the regional superintendent. The teacher did not appeal the decision, instead retiring. An analysis of the incident by the Philadelphia Daily News concluded that the school district's decision to fire the teacher was appropriate, but also agreed with the teacher's position that showing a 90-minute DVD should not have obliterated his 19 years as an educator.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{nearly a}} year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California, Downey, on condition of posting $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (spawned from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release. A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal, playing the new love interest of Calista Flockhart's title character. His performance was praised and the following year he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category and won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a mini-series or television film. He also appeared {{as a writer and}} singer on Vonda Shepard's Ally McBeal: For Once in My Life album, and he sang with Sting a duet of [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] in an episode of the series. Despite the apparent success, Downey claims that his performance on the series was overrated and said, [...] "It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give <b>a</b> <b>fuck</b> whether I ever acted again." [...] In January 2001, Downey was scheduled {{to play the role of}} Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} on stage nearly every weekend, even at Elks Lodges and YMCA centers. The band soon {{became part of}} a circuit that also {{included}} the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and the band found its way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at Soma, a local all-ages venue located on Market Street which the band longed to headline. Big-name acts such as NOFX and Green Day played {{on the main floor}}, while smaller acts were relegated to the basement, an area referred to as [...] "the Dungeon". The original location closed its doors and relocated before the band would be promoted to the main stage (which required a 100+ crowd to attend). [...] "Soma was like home away from home. All the punk kids who didn’t give <b>a</b> <b>fuck</b> about football games and proms or whatever came to hang out at Soma," [...] claimed Hoppus. The band's first big show on the main floor took place on a Thursday, where the band opened for Face to Face. Hoppus' manager at the record store, Patrick Secor, fronted him the money to properly record another demo at local studio Doubletime. The result was Buddha (1994), which the members of the band viewed as the band's first legitimate release. By this time, the group had branched out to venues such as the Soul Kitchen in El Cajon, but Raynor's family relocated to Reno, Nevada, and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull. The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, but eventually Raynor moved in with Hoppus for a summer in which the band would record its first album and music video and gain even more exposure.|$|E
