40|$|The {{conservation}} {{approach of}} “Heritage Rehabilitation,” {{as a means}} to give new life to deteriorated heritage buildings, seems to receive criticism from people of Hong Kong in recent years. While the government tries to promote this conservation treatment {{to strike a balance between}} sustainable development and heritage conservation, the news media appears to report related stories leaning to one side of public opinion: the side of conservationists, carrying <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> on government’s work to rehabilitate historic buildings. 　　　Studies in recent years indicated different preference on “what to conserve” among the government, scholars and the public in relation to heritage conservation. In addition, it also showed that the news media has an effect in pushing the conservation movement forward. However, there is limited research comparing the different opinions on “how to conserve” and investigating the news media’s effect on public perception on this conservation approach. 　　　This dissertation uses the rehabilitation of Wing Lee Street as a case study to explore and compare different perspectives on the rehabilitation work has been done on the street, ranging from those of the URA, architectural conservation scholars, those of the public expressed in questionnaires, the internet and via the news media, and news media interpretation. The comparison uses both statistical and text analyses. Findings suggested in the Wing Lee Street rehabilitation that there is no conflict in renovating the rundown Tong Lau and improving the street environments. 　　　However, concerning the degree of renovation, the use and maintaining the original community, there is a clear difference between the Urban Renewal Authority’s and other groups. While the Urban Renewal Authority put “Regulation” as its major reference for intervention, the scholars and public showed more concerns for the “Sense of Place” and the “Continuity of Life” on the street. 　　　The dissertation contributes to better understanding the different rationales and priorities for heritage rehabilitation from those expressed by the Urban Renewal Authority and architectural conservation professionals. In addition, it also illustrates public’s expectation on heritage rehabilitation, which will hopefully be a useful reference for a better outcome in future heritage rehabilitation projects. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} {{approach of}} “adaptive reuse”, {{as a means}} to give new life to deteriorated heritage buildings, seems to receive criticism from people of Hong Kong in recent years. While the government tries to promote this conservation treatment to seek a balance between sustainable development and heritage conservation, the residents unsatisfied with the conservation results; and carrying <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> on government’s too much intervention. Studies in recent years indicated different preference on “what to conserve” then a series of adaptive reuse potential model was constructed. However, there is limited research comparing different opinions on “how to conserve” and investigating the adaptive reuse outcomes of current projects in a comprehensive way. Hong Kong is a dynamic, contemporary city with short history. Relics in Hong Kong were often torn down once the economic returns of redevelopment much higher. Besides this, the limitation of resources both land and labor let the heritage buildings face the risks of demolition and redevelopment. “Change or continuity” and “reuse or demolition” have form the central argument for heritage conservation in Hong Kong. This dissertation uses the adaptive reuse of Wing Lee Street and Lui Seng Chun as a study case. Wing Lee Street is a completely government initiated project, while Lui Seng Chun is a product of government and non-government cooperation. Both cases possessing Hong Kong housing identity while sharing the same target, benefit community. Wing Lee Street took the compatible reuse approach while Lui Seng Chun adopted the appropriate reuse approach. Due to different reuse approach plus different stakeholders’ involvement, the reuse outcomes are totally different. The original target of Lui Seng Chun has been successfully met while Wing Lee Street failed to meet the reuse objective. After a detailed analysis, the thesis found that, convert old buildings to new uses is a better strategy than demolish and a scheme that allow non-government to apply for will bring a win-win situation. Learn from Lui Seng Chun, in order to bring vibrant to the street, the thesis suggests that Wing Lee Street should either go back to private ownership or maintaining the original inhabitants and tenants. On the other hand, there are also some recommendations for future adaptive reuse projects in Hong Kong: towards a collaborative partnership between different groups of people; incentives to enhance the economic viability of the use uses; and the heritage building conservation plan should accompanied by a long-term building management plan. In the nutshell, adaptive reuse is not about developing mega-events without wholly grounded decision-making or pursuit economic development at the cost of residents’ interests. It is more about engaging with the lives of those {{people who live in the}} city. This dissertation contributes to identifying the major factors of the sustainability framework for the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. Hope this dissertation will be a useful reference for a better outcome in future heritage building projects in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Based on Michel Foucault’s {{idea of the}} power/knowledge {{relationship}} reflecting <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> {{the modern}} world, this paper investigates the issue of madness as a signifier in Briefing for a Descent into Hell, challenging the status quo of culture from all aspects, socio-political, medical, historical perspectives. How does one define madness or insanity? One can attempt a definition by contrasting the term with the definition which recognizes one who has lost all <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self and the society or culture that produces the so-called insane. The issue of madness in modern fiction often expresses itself in crisis and transgression of the cultural establishment. In Briefing for a Descent into Hell, Doris Lessing suggests a possible “brave new world” in a madman’s “inner space. ” By juxtaposing Charles Watkins’s “real” world and his “dream” world, the author criticizes such cultural institutions as hospitals and universities, the society in which the insane lives, the depravity, the insanity and {{the violence of the}} time which makes it almost impossible for one to reason appropriately. The multiple realities in the novel are not just designed for narrative purposes, but to ridicule the absurdity of what the society terms “reality,” In this respect, this study will be examining the representation of “madness” in Briefing for a Descent into Hell as a signifier as well as a cultural malaise. ...|$|R

Cold Fusion Video's Nathan Shumate echoed Bracken's opinion on the [...] "authenticity" [...] created from the Romanian landscaping and actors that gave [...] "the feel of verisimilitude", but criticized the stop-motion subspecies as being [...] "irrelevant to the main action", and the story as a [...] "general lack of urgency". Richard Scheib, a critic for science fiction, horror, and fantasy review website Moria, felt the original film [...] "showed promise" [...] when it attempted to go [...] "back to the folklore roots of vampirism"; he also liked the authentic feeling from shooting in Romania, but felt the limited budget restricted the film from being convincing, with David Allen's stop-motion subspecies creatures being a disappointment. When {{he had a chance to}} review Bloodstone, Scheib felt the sequel delivered [...] "vampire clichés", but again [...] "showed promise" [...] with its imaginative make-up effects—specifically the staking of Stefan, the reattachment of Radu's head by the subspecies creatures, the look of Mummy—as well as the visual effects of Radu's shadow stalking Michelle through town, which gave Scheib <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Nosferatu. Another <b>criticism</b> from Scheib was with the replacement of Laura Tate with Denice Duff; Scheib characterizes Duff as [...] "internalized and afraid", as opposed to the addition of Melanie Shatner's character, Rebecca Morgan, whom he classifies as [...] "alert and intelligent".|$|R

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: mothers and fathers had similar feelings concerning postnatal <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> security. Of the dimensions in the PPSS instrument, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> midwives'/nurses' empowering behaviour, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> one's own general well-being and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the mother's well-being as experienced by the father {{were the most important}} dimensions for parents' experienced security. <b>A</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> affinity within the family (for both parents) and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> manageable breast feeding (for mothers) were not significantly associated with their experienced security. <b>A</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> participation during pregnancy and general anxiety were significantly associated background variables for postnatal <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> security for both parents.
