40|$|Involvement of {{the cost}} {{advisers}} -in the early stage of the building design process (briefing stage) for the forecasting of probable cost of projects is often minimal. The traditional pre tender estimating techniques such as unit method, cost per unit floor area method, cube method, <b>approximate</b> <b>quantities</b> method and the like used to forecast the probable cost of projects are not satisfactory. This bars the cost adviser to make the fullest contribution in the early design stage decisions. The surveys conducted in this research revealed the fact that local design practice with respect to design stage estimating is limited to unit method, cost per unit floor area method and later stage <b>approximate</b> <b>quantities</b> method and elemental cost method. The use of computer facility to automate tasks in local practice is very low. Quantity surveyors in design offices use spreadsheet software for calculations. Use of database software or other programming languages {{in the process of}} cost advice was not evidenced. This research is, thus, aimed at establishing a computer aided cost model based on bill of <b>approximate</b> <b>quantities</b> properly linked to Standard Method of Measurement (SMM) with the flexibility in application during briefing, sketch plan and working drawing stages. Being linked to SMM, the proposed model ensures transformation of design and cost data into a BOQ prepared in accordance with SMM. The current practice of using bill of <b>approximate</b> <b>quantities</b> for cost forecasting is limited to later stages of the design process since the method requires design information to work upon. This difficulty has been overcome in the proposed model by incorporating design and cost data libraries with computer manipulation. [...] A case study was used to generate quantities, compile historical design data, and provide causal relationships to the model. These data coupled with solution neutral design information were used to develop design data library and cost data library of the model which provide sufficient information to make professional judgements at the briefing stage...|$|R

40|$|Two domain-specific {{quantity}} {{systems have}} been proposed; the “Precise Number System” for small precise numerical representations, and the “Approximate Number System” for imprecise numerical representations (Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004). The efficiency of these systems has been individually associated with numerical competence (Mazzocco, Feigenson, & Halberda, 2011; Schleifer & Landerl, 2011). Phonological awareness and VSSP functioning are domain-general cognitive skills which {{have been shown to}} contribute to distinct aspects of early numerical competence (Krajewski & Schneider, 2009; LeFevre et al., 2010). Krajewski and Schneider’s model (2009) proposes three distinct developmental levels of early number skills; phonological awareness contributes to basic verbal number skills (Level I) while VSSP functioning and quantitative skills contribute to quantity to number-word linkage (Level II) and to early arithmetic skills (Level III). This thesis examines the longitudinal and independent contributions that domain-specific and domain-general cognitive skills make to early number skills and to two standardised mathematical attainment measures. Verbal, visuo-spatial and quantitative skills were assessed in 129 children at the start of Reception Year. Precise quantity discrimination skills predicted performance and growth in children’s ability to count objects (Level II), <b>approximate</b> <b>quantity</b> discrimination skills predicted performance and growth in reciting the number-word sequence (Level I) and the two domain-general cognitive skills predicted performance and growth in performing simple arithmetic skills (Level III) over an eighteen-month period. Also, <b>approximate</b> <b>quantity</b> discrimination skills, phonological awareness and VSSP functioning predicted performance in both mathematical attainment measures over a six-month period. However VSSP functioning predicted performance and growth in a specific mathematical attainment measure over an eighteen-month period. Each cognitive skill seems to have a circumscribed role as a precursor of specific later number skills. This suggests that identifying deficits in these cognitive skills and designing targeted-intervention programmes for children in the very early stages of schooling could prevent later general mathematical deficits...|$|E

Here, we study the interface between these two systems using an estimation task. Observers were asked to estimate the approximate numerosity of dot arrays. We show that, {{in the absence of}} calibration, estimates are largely inaccurate: responses increase monotonically with numerosity, but underestimate the actual numerosity. However, insertion of a few inducer trials, in which participants are explicitly (and sometimes misleadingly) told that a given display contains 30 dots, is sufficient to calibrate their estimates on the whole range of stimuli. Based on these empirical results, we develop a model of the mapping between the numerical symbols and the representations of numerosity on the number line...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{stimulus}} variability on development {{of the ability to}} make quantity judgements related to area. Participants were 241 children (aged 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 years) and 82 university students, who were asked to compare the quantities in 2 sets of 5 chocolate bars of constant width but variable length. Participants indicated which set contained more chocolate or that the amounts of chocolate were equal. Judgement accuracy of 12 -year-olds and adults decreased monotonically as the variance of bar lengths increased. In younger children, performance was low when variance was very low or very high, but accuracy was higher for intermediate levels of variance, thus resulting in an inverted U-shaped effect. This pattern was confirmed in a second experiment in which we controlled for a possible age-related response bias against “equal” judgements. Findings suggest that judgements of quantity are based on a mixture of learned heuristics and comparisons of <b>approximate</b> <b>quantity</b> representations, both of which develop throughout childhood...|$|E
40|$|Much {{evidence}} has accumulated {{to suggest that}} many animals, including young human infants, possess an abstract sense of <b>approximate</b> <b>quantity,</b> a number sense. Most research has concentrated on apparent numerosity of spatial arrays of dots or other objects, but a truly abstract sense of number should be capable of encoding the numerosity of any set of discrete elements, however displayed and in whatever sensory modality. Here, we use the psychophysical technique of adaptation to study the sense of number for serially presented items. We show that numerosity of both auditory and visual sequences is greatly affected by prior adaptation to slow or rapid sequences of events. The adaptation to visual stimuli was spatially selective (in external, not retinal coordinates), pointing to a sensory rather than cognitive process. However, adaptation generalized across modalities, from auditory to visual and vice versa. Adaptation also generalized across formats: adaptingtosequen-tial streams of flashes affected the perceived numerosity of spatial arrays. All these results point to a perceptual system that transcends vision and audition to encode an abstract sense of number in space and in time...|$|E

The third part in devoted to the powerful framework of Dirichlet forms whose main feature is to apply easily to infinite dimensional models including the Wiener space (giving an interpretation of Malliavin calculus in terms of errors), the Poisson space and the Monte Carlo space.
