40|$|Abstract. In this thesis, <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> {{were used}} as an {{alternative}} way to analyzing Ottoman foundations. Although this kind of documents originally were prepared to register foundations’ incomes and expenditures, they had various information about the period they belonged to. Particularly <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> for the foundations which were built by Ottoman sultans, their family members or government officials have been more crucial. They were usually managed and audited by state officials, supported {{when they were in}} need, employed people around the government. In other words these kind of Ottoman foundations were not independent from economic, social or political aspects of the Empire. Moreover <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> could be benefited understanding the foundations’ structure, management, wealth and public services. In this study Kethuda Canfeda Hatun Foundations to be decided to analyze according to seventeenth century <b>accounting</b> <b>books.</b> She had been in Sultan Murad III. ’s (1574 - 1595) imperial harem as an administrative manager during late sixteenth century.

5000|$|Discounted {{cash flow}} {{calculations}} {{have been used}} in some form since money was first lent at interest in ancient times.

This method of asset valuation differentiated between the <b>accounting</b> <b>book</b> value, which is based on the amount paid for the asset. [...] Following the stock market crash of 1929, discounted cash flow analysis gained popularity as a valuation method for stocks.

5000|$|In <b>accounting,</b> <b>book</b> {{value is}} the value of an asset {{according}} to its balance sheet account balance. For assets, the value is based on the original cost of the asset less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs made against the asset. Traditionally, a company's book value is its total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities. [...] However, in practice, depending on the source of the calculation, book value may variably include goodwill, intangible assets, or both. [...] The value inherent in its workforce, part of the Intellectual capital of a company, is always ignored. When intangible assets and goodwill are explicitly excluded, the metric is often specified to be [...] "tangible book value".|$|E

5000|$|The Romans {{called the}} first day of every month the [...] "calends", {{signifying}} {{the start of a new}} lunar phase. On this day, the pontiffs would announce the number of days until the next month at the Curia Calabra; in addition, debtors had to pay off their debts on this day. These debts were inscribed in the kalendaria, effectively an <b>accounting</b> <b>book.</b> Modern calendars count the number of days after the first of each month; by contrast, the Roman calendar measured the number of days until certain upcoming dates (such as the calends, the nones or the ides). In order to calculate the day of the calends of the upcoming month, it is necessary to count the number of days remaining in the current month, then add two to that number. For example, April 22 is the 10th of the calends of May, because there are eight days left in April.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-eighteenth century [...] "Charles Town" [...] was an {{economic}} booming city, the average resident citizens being several times wealthier {{on the whole}} than those of New York or Philadelphia. Providing furniture to these wealthy Charlestonians was a lucrative business for the local wood craftsmen and cabinetmakers. The people of Charleston considered themselves as English citizens that {{just happened to be}} living in the American colony of South Carolina and did everything possible to follow the footsteps of London society, like acquiring fine furniture. The wealthy Charlestonians loved London style furnishings and would purchase most anything along these fashions that was hand made by local woodworkers. This booming economy made Elfe's woodworking shop successful and profitable. An Elfe's business account book of transactions survives and is held by the Charleston Library Society. This <b>accounting</b> <b>book</b> covering several accounts shows that between 1768 and 1775 Elfe with several employees hand-made over fifteen-hundred furniture pieces including fine detailed cabinets. These records show that he sold about seventeen pieces of furniture per month on average.|$|E

5000|$|D. M. Bare's {{influence}} can {{be found}} in practically every aspect of town life: out of his general store in 1864, he developed a department store which became known as [...] "the company store;", now Roaring Spring Department Store, in 1867, he co-sponsored the construction of the first Methodist Church; from 1868 to 1883, he served {{as one of the first}} postmasters, nominating the village's name change to Roaring Spring in 1868; he oversaw the creation of the town's first modern utilities, including the telephone system (1880), the water supply (1892), and electrical service (1892). The paper company underwrote the cost of extending a line from Altoona to Roaring Spring where the first telephone was installed in the head office of the mill. In a desire to create more jobs in 1887, Bare co-founded the Roaring Spring Blank Book Company, which became a primary customer for his paper, and later generated electric current for residential service until the 1920s. Bare eventually entrusted the operation of Blank Book to his son-in-law, Dr. A. L. Garver, who joined the company at its founding and became general manager by 1891. Garver is credited with building Blank Book into the world's third leading maker of <b>accounting</b> <b>book</b> and school stationery by the 1920s.14 In the 1880s, Bare set aside land for the town's first public parks: Memorial Park at Grove Street and the Borough Park at Spang and Spring Streets. In 1902, he founded the town's first bank, and through the 1900-1910s oversaw the brick paving of many public streets. In 1907, he co-founded the Eldon Inn with his three sons-in-law as the town's leading hotel for business travelers. Throughout his lifetime here (1863-1925), Bare is credited with playing many other informal roles to help organize and improve the community life of the town.|$|E
