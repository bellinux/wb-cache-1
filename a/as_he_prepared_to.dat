Jackson received a congratulatory call from Gore after his election in 1995. In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, and {{went out of his way}} to instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson's district to boost Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect {{took control of the}} match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E
5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny {{them the right to}} vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E

5|$|The gallery on {{the second}} floor of the library {{building}} was not formally dedicated until July 4, 1918. That date marked the beginning of the library's permanent collection, which started with additions from members of the Eagle's Nest Colony. Members donated twelve statues, twenty oil paintings, and four portraits to the permanent collection of the art gallery. One of the statues in the collection is a 4-foot (1.2-m) plaster study of The Eternal Indian by Lorado Taft. It was completed in 1908 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> create the Black Hawk Statue at the original site of the Eagle's Nest Colony. The entire permanent collection consists of 32 paintings and 32 sculptures from Eagle's Nest artists. A citizen left the library a Currier and Ives lithograph collection which contains 46 Currier and Ives lithographs and 14 lithographs by Nathaniel Currier. The two collections have been appraised at over $700,000.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee {{left for}} lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack shaping up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> have his cavalry {{division}} defend the left flank against the attack. Munford sent several couriers {{to look for}} Pickett or Fitzhugh Lee to tell them of the impending attack {{but they could not}} be found. Captain Henry Lee of Fitzhugh Lee's staff also could not find them. Munford had his division dismount, and deployed it on the left of Ransom's refused line. Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack as best he could, not always in co-operation with each other.|$|E
25|$|Frieze A {{originally}} depicted Domitian <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> depart for {{a campaign}} against the Chatti. Contemporary authors such as Suetonius later alleged that Domitian's military endeavours were largely a failure, motivated by a quest for personal glory rather than necessity. The scene depicted on Frieze A seems to counter such accusations by presenting Domitian as a reluctant general, spurred on by the Gods Mars, Minerva and Roma, who are pictured on the far left, to defend his home country. Other characters who appear in this scene are the Genii, or guardian spirits, of the Roman Senate {{and the people of}} Rome, and a number of soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), {{like the}} Russians, often {{combined}} their TBs (which possessed only hull numbers) with their torpedo boat destroyers (TBDs) (often simply referring {{to them as}} destroyers) and launched over 270 torpedoes (counting the opening engagement at Port Arthur on 8 February 1904) during the war. The IJN deployed approximately 21 TBs during the conflict, and on 27 May 1905 the Japanese torpedo boat destroyers and TBs launched 16 torpedoes at the battleship , Admiral Rozhestvensky's flagship {{at the battle of}} Tsushima. Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, the IJN commander, had ordered his torpedo boats to finish off the enemy flagship, already gunned into a wreck, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> pursue the remnants of the Russian battle fleet.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{played in}} all the {{qualifying}} matches for the 2009 European Championships, In the finals, he started the first two group-stage matches and was rested for the last match as England had already sealed their passage to the knock-out stage. In the semi-final against Sweden, he conceded three goals {{in the second half}} as the match ended 3‚Äì3 after extra time, but made up for it by saving a penalty and scoring another as England won 5‚Äì4 in the shoot-out. However, he was yellow-carded for leaving his line to talk to Mikael Lustig <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> take his penalty.

25|$|If {{the first}} {{appearance}} of this column had caused alarm and perplexity among the {{troops of the}} French left wing, the apprehensions it excited on the Prussian right, when its cavalry was observed to advance and to drive back Colonel Marwitz' Brigade, which had been sent towards it in reconnaissance (as already explained), were still greater; and its equally unexpected disappearance (with the exception of its cavalry, and a portion of its infantry), {{at a moment when}} it was felt that its vigorous co-operation must have rendered the issue of the battle no longer doubtful, was looked upon as a particularly fortunate turn of affairs; and Bl√ºcher's hopes revived <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> carry into effect his meditated attack upon the French left flank.|$|E

25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920‚Äì1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got any sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was watching in the stands, dropped her knitting <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> face his first ball, bent down to retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) {{was formed}} by Taylor's former teammates, Lester and Frank Patrick. They {{encouraged}} Taylor to come west.

Before he left, Taylor said one of the two new Toronto teams in the NHA was owned by Lichtenhein, who was plotting to send Taylor to Toronto and prevent him from playing for Ottawa. The accusation was denied by the presidents of both Toronto teams and by Lichtenhein, who all said he had no ownership stake in either team.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the next}} morning, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> advance further, Caesar {{received}} word from Atrius that, once again, his ships at anchor had been dashed {{against each other}} in a storm and suffered considerable damage. About forty, he says, were lost. The Romans were unused to Atlantic and Channel tides and storms, but nevertheless, considering the damage he had sustained the previous year, this was poor planning on Caesar's part. However, Caesar may have exaggerated the number of ships wrecked to magnify his own achievement in rescuing the situation. He returned to the coast, recalling the legions that had gone ahead, and immediately set about repairing his fleet. His men worked day and night for approximately ten days, beaching and repairing the ships, and building a fortified camp around them. Word was sent to Labienus to send more ships.|$|E
