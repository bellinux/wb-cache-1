The library is now on one floor. This format was planned to be rolled out across all of the council's libraries but what was seen as costing too much.|$|E

Since it was thought that these stories might refer to Leichhardt's party, Forrest {{was asked to}} lead a party to the site, with Mungaro as their guide and there to search for evidence of Leichhardt's fate.|$|E

500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus, but Spears rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, [...] "I wrote {{it for her}} [...] <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now." [...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as {{she felt that she}} seldom found time to just let loose and have fun.|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> decided I would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E

Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but it was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Perry has {{expressed}} ambivalence towards the lasting vilification of the Daddies' name, admitting it's [...] "probably the most heinous {{name in the}} history of rock" [...] while emphasizing a disparate delineation between the band's roots in the [...] "bubble" [...] of Eugene's punk subculture and their unexpected longevity in the wider cultural mainstream: [...] "I started this band <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> we just used [...] We didn't know that in 10 years we'd turn into some sort of happy, peppy, feel-good things". Though Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies' name earlier in their career, he has nevertheless acquiescently embraced the name as his [...] "Holden Caulfield red hunting hat", while outright dismissing critics who choose to demonize the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from. [...] "It gives outrage addicts another soapbox they can jump up on", Perry said, [...] "If people want to just look at it , then that's their problem, but I don't write it that way"..."I assure you we don't cruise high schools for dates".|$|E
500|$|John A.

He concluded for the album, [...] " [...] hits you with recognizable hit after recognizable hit, and they are all pretty much as perfect as contemporary R gets". Describing the album as a [...] "masterclass in what happens when a great band comes together", Yahoo! Music's Hattie Collins wrote, [...] "Despite the low-points, this is a Destiny's Child must have collection of classics from one of R's most significant talents". A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website musicOMH who felt the album included many [...] "skippable" [...] songs and noted that the material from The Writing's on the Wall and Survivor were the collection's best. She {{felt that the}} progress in the sound of the band was evident on #1's, but offered the opinion, [...] "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves to be pretty ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R". San Francisco Chronicle Aidin Vaziri criticized the songs from Destiny Fulfilled and [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] and concluded [...] "surveying Destiny's Child's entire career on this set... it's obvious their hearts slipped away around the same time Beyonce's solo album sold its first million".|$|E

2500|$|The Germanic {{language}} which diutisc {{most likely}} comes from is West Frankish, a language which died out <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> {{which there is}} hardly any written evidence for today. This was the Germanic dialect used in the early Middle Ages, spoken by the Franks in Western Francia, i.e. in the region which is now northern France. The word is only known from the Latin form theodiscus. Until the 8th century the Franks called their language frengisk; however, when the Franks moved their political and cultural centre to the area where France now is, the term frengisk became ambiguous, as in the West Francian territory some Franks spoke Latin, some vulgar Latin and some theodisc. For this reason a new word was needed to help differentiate between them. Thus the word theodisc evolved from the Germanic word theoda (the people) with the Latin suffix -iscus, to mean [...] "belonging to the people", i.e. the people's language.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2004, {{an unknown}} entity calling himself [...] "Steev Mike" [...] – a {{pseudonym}} Andrew W.K. had used for himself on {{several of his}} releases – launched a number of websites accusing W.K. of fraud and not being behind his own career. After W.K.'s official website was hacked, apparently by the same entity, W.K. attempted to address the confusion in a public statement in which he wrote, [...] "PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE STEEV MIKE. I USED TO CALL MYSELF STEEV MIKE <b>A</b> <b>LONG</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>AGO</b> <b>AND</b> IT'S NOTHING NOW. Someone is trying to confuse you and make me look bad." [...] In May 2009, W.K. discussed the accusations {{in an interview with}} British magazine Front, in which he stated that [...] "the nature of how we presented my initial offerings caused some confusion, even though I tried to make it as straightforward as possible," [...] and: [...] "Different people I've worked with and different parts of my back story have gotten twisted and changed. But I made the music on my albums – I had a lot of help from incredible people, but not the kind of help that some people think."
