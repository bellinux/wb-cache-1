50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded {{particle}} boards and cement fibre. Cement bonded particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have cellulose fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{some of the}} degradation phenomena exhibited by modern oil paintings and twentieth century oil paint formulations and possible correlations with the various organic additives typically introduced by manufacturers. The research takes into consideration historical and modern tube oil paints produced by different European manufacturers and selected twentieth century oil paintings which showed degradation problems such as efflorescence, softening, cracks and sensitivity towards water and polar solvents. The composition of oil paints and paintings samples was studied with XRF, SEM-EDX, ATR-FTIR and GCMS. The results showed that both artists’ oil paints and paintings samples contain a complex mixture of additives to the oil binders and pigments. The presence of <b>aluminium</b> and zinc <b>stearates,</b> added as dispersion agent gelling agents, was detected in most paint formulations of HKS, W&N, Talens and Maimeri (c. 1940 -present). Several paint films showed an unusually high content of fatty diacids, suggesting that, in drying, an oxidative reaction was favoured above polymerisation. This occurrence, together with the diversity of lipidic media, additives, pigments and driers present in the industrial formulations could {{play a crucial role}} in paint failure and instability, as showed by the analysed case studies. The obtained results may help understanding the behaviour of modern oil paints and painting surfaces and contribute to improved conservation methods...|$|R
40|$|From the 19 th Century, artists’ {{oil paints}} were {{increasingly}} produced on an industrial scale {{and include a}} number of additives, e. g. stabilisers, dispersion agents and driers [1]. These additives allowed for faster production, stability, prolonged shelf life and uniform handling properties of the paints in and from the tubes. In particular, <b>aluminium</b> and zinc <b>stearates</b> were introduced as wetting and dispersion agents for the pigments and as stabiliser for the paint. However, the incorporation of stearates into manufactured oil paints may cause water sensitivity during surface cleaning of unvarnished paintings [2, 3]. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate 20 th century manufactured oil paints by developing an analytical methodology for the detection of metal soaps and lipidic additives using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). A methodology for the detection of metal stearate and fatty acid additives was designed by analysis of selected oil paint films. In addition, commercial tube oil paints from Winsor&Newton, Old Holland, Talens, Gimborn, and Maimeri were tested. The developed analytical procedure was also used for the analysis of samples from 20 th century oil paintings by Lucio Fontana, Jasper Johns, Karel Appel, Willem de Kooning, and others. The results obtained pointed out the employ of different kinds of oil media (such as linseed oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, etc) and the presence of additives (such as stearates, hydrogenated castor oil, waxes, etc). The identification of binding media and additives in paint samples is important for the knowledge about painting techniques and to understand degradation phenomena which occurr in modern and comtemporary works of art as well. This knowledge may also {{play a role in the}} design of conservative practice.

40|$|Zinc oxide is a {{prevalent}} pigment in {{twentieth century}} oil based paints. Its reactivity with fatty acids has consequences for paint film properties and stability. Resulting zinc carboxylates are implicated {{in a variety}} of deterioration phenomena affecting late nineteenth and twentieth century paintings. Naturally aged artists’ oil paints and reference paint film draw downs are investigated using scanning electron microscopy, and conventional attenuated total reflectance and synchrotron transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This study reports results for soybean oil paints and Naples yellow hue pigment mixtures with zinc oxide in addition to previously reported findings for linseed and safflower oil based paints involving zinc oxide alone and in combination with lead and titanium whites. A solvent model examining interactions between zinc oxide and stearic acid or <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> supports observations made in paint films. The significance of <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> as a stearic acid source in paint formulations is corroborated and is more significant than oil type or pigment combination for formation of high concentrations and more pronounced separation of saturated C 16 and C 18 chain zinc carboxylates...|$|E
40|$|Several {{techniques}} for preparing samples for {{liquid scintillation counting}} have been described in the literature. Solid samples of materials (i. e. Ba' 4 CO 3, powdered biological material, absorbant of thin-layer chromatography plates, inorganic salts, etc.) that are not soluble in liquid scintillation mixtures may be counted by suspending the material as a powder in the liquid scintillant Originally the counting sample was simply shaken and then counted, allowance being made for the settling that occurred. This technique was not valuable because the efficiency and reproductibility was not satisfactory. More satisfactory results are obtained, however, when a gelifying agent is incorpor-ated in the liquid scintillant to prevent settling. The material is homogeneously suspended in the vial containing the liquid scintillator. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> has been used at a concentration of 5 % in toluene or in xylene, 1 containing the fluors (PPO, POPOP). The <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate,</b> however, has the disadvantage of making a hard gel, creating a difficult homogeneous distribution of the solid radioactive sample. Another material, named 'Thixcin ' (ricinoleic acid), {{has been used as}} a gelifying agent. 2 This material enables the preparation of a certain quantity of gelifying gel in advance, at a concentration of 25 g of 'Thixcin ' in powder for 1 litre of scintillating liquid. The samples of the liquid scintillation prepared with this product have a good optical trans-mission. Nevertheless, its use as a gelifying agent has some disadvantages, in particular because it loses its gelifying properties at room temperature, allowing the suspended product to deposit. Another product has been described in the literature and used, namely colloidal silica. 3 It has been used under the name of 'Cab. O-Sil't at a concentration of 4 % b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- High {{molecular}} weight polyethylene can be processed into fibers with tensile strengths at break of about 5 GPa and Young's moduli upto 200 GPa by either applying the 'surface growth " technique {{or a combination}} of gel-spinning and hot-drawing. The mechanism of the piplecular process in both techniques involves the oriented crystallization:-ytretching of an entanglement network. The high strength levels are only achieved either by crystallizing the stretched network or by drawing the semi-crystalline gel at relatively high temperatures in order to transform the elastically ineffective chain ends of the entanglement network into the strong back-bone structure. Evidence is presented for the presence of entanglements in the ultra—strong polyethylene fibers and for the necessity of entangle-ment in achieving high strengths by hot-drawing. High fiber production rates of the order of 270 rn/mm. can be attained by adding 1 wt. % of <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> to the paraffin oil solution. This additive avoids the adsorption of polyethylene {{on the wall of the}} die and suppresses melt-fracture during extrusion...|$|E
40|$|Stress is a {{biological}} response to aversive conditions {{that tend to}} threaten or perturb the homeostasis of the organisms. Stress {{is one of the}} basic factors in the etiology of number of diseases and stress has been postulated to be involved in pathogenesis of various diseases, such as psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, immune suppression, endocrine disorder like diabetes mellitus, impotency, cognitive dysfunction, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis and cardiovascular disorder like atherosclerosis and hypertension. So a mixture of herbal extracts like Arjuna, Ashwagandha, Brahmi and Shankhapushpi in equal ratios was microencapsulated using different types of wall polymers by non solvent addition method. Microcapsules were evaluated for their percentage yield, percentage actual drug content, percentage extract entrapment efficiency, flowability and drug release kinetics. Kollicoat SR 30 D and <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> were observed as effective in prevention of particle aggregation during phase separation. Microcapsules were shown controlled drug release pattern for 12 hours due to the presence of Eudragit RS 100 and Eudragit RL 100. Both these wall polymers are responsible for controlling the drug release from microcapsules through diffusion in phosphate buffer medium having p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} tribology during plane strain compression testing (PSCT) of aluminium strip with steel tools. lubricated by mineral base oils containing either stearic acid or <b>aluminium</b> <b>stearate</b> as additive in concentrations up to 0. 5 %. The present study is a follow-up {{to the work of}} Sutcliffe et al. [Boundary lubrication of aluminium strip during plane strain compression, Wear 254 (2003) 65 - 79]. The close conformance of the strip and tool indicate that boundary lubrication should {{play a significant role in}} the tribology. The new work supports the conclusions of the previous study, that for the first indent hydrodynamic influences are important, while additives do not affect friction. After a number of indentations a transfer layer builds up on the tool. Depending on the additive concentration and tool roughness, this may either lead to a rise or fall in friction factor. Scanning electron microscope and optical observations show how the transfer layer can either form a smooth mottled appearance which is easily removed using tissue paper for higher additive concentrations, or takes the form of strongly attached particles for lower additive concentrations or in the absence of additives. Similar behaviour is observed for the two types of additive. indicating that the stearate chain in the soap is able to react with the Fe-based tool as effectively as when it is part of the acid-and probably also with the Al strip...|$|E
