Further, there is little information on whether the changes in motor performance reflect immediate or chronic adaptations to changing gravitational environments. To {{determine the effects of}} microgravity on the neural control properties of selected motor pools, four male astronauts from the NASA STS- 78 mission performed motor tasks requiring the maintenance of either ankle dorsiflexor or plantarflexor torque. Torques of 10 or 50 % of a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were requested of the subjects during 10 degrees peak-to-peak sinusoidal movements at 0. 5 Hz. When 10 % MVC of the plantarflexors was requested, the <b>actual</b> <b>torques</b> generated in-flight were similar to pre-flight values. Post-flight torques were higher than pre- and in-flight <b>torques.</b> The <b>actual</b> <b>torques</b> when 50 % MVC was requested were higher in- and post-flight than pre-flight. Soleus (Sol) electromyographic (EMG) amplitudes during plantarflexion were higher in-flight than pre- or post-flight for both the 10 and 50 % MVC tasks. No differences in medial gastrocnemius (MG) EMG amplitudes were observed for either the 10 or 50 % MVC tasks. The EMG amplitudes of the tibialis anterior (TA), an antagonist to plantarflexion, were higher in- and post-flight than pre-flight for the 50 % MVC task. During the dorsiflexion tasks, the torques generated in both the 10 and 50 % MVC tasks did not differ pre-, in- and post-flight. TA EMG amplitudes were significantly higher in- than pre-flight for both the 10 or 50 % MVC tasks, and remained elevated post-flight for the 50 % MVC test. Both the Sol and MG EMG amplitudes were significantly higher in-flight than either pre- or post-flight for both the 10 and 50 % MVC tests. These data suggest that the most consistent response to space flight was an elevation in the level of contractions of agonists and antagonists when attempting to maintain constant torques at a given level of MVC. Also, the chronic levels of EMG activity in selected ankle flexor and extensor muscles during space flight and during routine activities on Earth were recorded. Compared with pre- and post-flight values, there was a marked increase in the total EMG activity of the TA and the Sol and no change in the MG EMG activity in-flight. These data indicate that space flight, as occurs on shuttle missions, is a model of elevated activation of both flexor and extensor muscles, probably reflecting the effects of programmed work schedules in flight rather than a direct effect of microgravity...|$|R

If the shaft system of a coupled compressor is not adequately designed, {{or if the}} motor malfunctions, this torsional excitation will have destructive effect. Recently, mathematical models for this system have been solved by direct integration on both analog and digital computers. Important aspects of the model include: representation of the electrical power feed network for the motor, an equivalent circuit description of the motor itself, and a non-linear characterization of the shafts and couplings connecting the compressors to the motor. In parallel with this analytical effort it was recognized that the instantaneous magnitude of the excitation torque and its resultant shaft stress should be measured during field installation.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the control strategy employed by gymnasts in maintaining a hand balance. It was hypothesized that a "wrist strategy" was used in which perturbations in the sagittal plane were corrected using variations in wrist flexor torque with synergistic shoulder and hip torques acting to preserve a fixed body configuration. A theoretical model of wrist strategy indicated that control could be effected using wrist torque that was a linear function of mass center displacement and velocity. Four male gymnasts executed hand balances and 2 -dimensional inverse dynamics was used to determine net joint torque time histories at the wrist, shoulder, and hip joints in the sagittal plane. Wrist torque was regressed against mass center position and velocity values at progressively earlier times. It was found that all gymnasts used the wrist strategy, with time delays ranging from 160 to 240 ms. The net joint torques at the shoulder and hip joints were regressed against the torques required to maintain a fixed configuration.

Unfortunately, it appears impossible to compensate for such discrepancies in a clinical setting, as, although in our experience, the bracket slots were invariably larger than their nominal size, some archwires were oversized and some were smaller than the measurements declared by the manufacturer, and the variable degree of bevelling will also affect the archwire/slot play.|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 153 - 176 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing turbomachinery users today is that of torsional vibration. In contrast to lateral rotordynamics problems, torsional failures are especially heinous since the first symptom of a problem is often a broken shaft, gear tooth, or coupling. The difficulty of detecting incipient failures in the field makes {{the performance of a}} thorough torsional vibration analysis an essential component of the turbomachinery design process. The primary objective of this tutorial is to provide such a procedure for the special case where the turbomachine is driven by a synchronous motor. Synchronous motors {{are one of the most}} notorious sources or torsional vibration problems because of the large pulsating torques they generate during startups. The torsional shaft stresses generated by these large pulsations are usually greater than the shaft material endurance limits, thereby, causing the lives of such machines to be limited. The determination of the number of startups that these machines can survive is, therefore, a critical portion of their design process. It is the authors? experience that there is a great deal of confusion over the proper way to do this. The full impact of this confusion was seen on a recently designed compressor train where the use of one method showed the allowable number of starts to be zero while a second procedure predicted infinite life. In an attempt to alleviate this confusion, a logical, step-by-step procedure, based on the strain-life theory of failure, was generated and is presented herein. An example illustrating how the authors used this procedure to design a critical 66, 000 hp air compressor is also presented. The authors believe that employment of this method may well save the user from the need to introduce an expensive and unwieldy Holsetstyle damping coupling into some future compressor train. Although the presented analytical procedure is quite rigorous, there are cases, especially on critical equipment, where it is wise to augment its predictions with torsional test data taken from the field. The best way to do this in synchronous mo*tor-driven equipment is to apply strain gauges to critical shafts in the drive train and measure the <b>actual</b> <b>torques</b> that are generated during startup. Accordingly, a general description of strain gauge testing fundamentals is provided to familiarize all users with it. Additionally, the use of this valuable testing procedure is illustrated via the same 66, 000 hp air compressor that was used to illustrate the analytical procedure. The tutorial closes with a comparison of the obtained analytical and test results and an illustration of how the authors used the testing to ?fine-tune? the analytical results...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the <b>actual</b> {{effective}} <b>torque</b> is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed <b>torque,</b> the <b>actual</b> output <b>torque</b> changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R

The objective is to detect external impacts applied to the robot using only proprioceptive information with maximal sensitivity. Several model-based detection methods in robotics are based on the difference, called residual, between the estimated and the <b>actual</b> applied <b>torques.</b> Sensitivity of such methods can be limited by model uncertainties that originate either from errors on experimentally identified model parameters, possibly varying with the operating conditions, or the use of simplified models, which results in a residual dependence on the robot's state. The main contribution of this paper consists of a new adaptive residual evaluation method that takes into account this dependence, which otherwise can lead to a tradeoff between sensitivity and false alarm rate. The proposed approach uses only proprioceptive motor-side measurements and does not require any additional joint position sensors or force/torque sensors. Dynamic effects of a collision on the residual are isolated using bandpass filtering and comparison with a state-dependent dynamic threshold. Adaptive online estimation of filter coefficients avoids the need for extensive experiments for parametric model identification.

The tests consisted of loading the foot in different configurations and recording the applied force and the corresponding strain measurement. The tests were performed in 1 - plantarflexion by applying a load when the heel was in contact with the ground, 2 - dorsiflexion by applying a load when the forefoot was in contact with the ground, 3 - eversion by applying a load when the right edge of the forefoot was in contact with the ground, and 4 - inversion by applying a load when the left edge of the forefoot was in contact with the ground. From the external forces, the geometry of the foot, and the strain measurements, the applied torques were calculated. It {{is important to note that}} in the sagittal plane, the proportional factor between the external force and the strains measured at heel loading and forefoot loading were not the same, since the strain gauges were attached to two different areas of the foot. The proportional factors for the strain gauges at heel loading and forefoot loading were estimated at 1.41 and 19.52 Â Nm/volt, respectively. As a result, different proportional factors needed to be used depending if the strain measurement was positive or negative. In the frontal plane, the proportional factors for inversion and eversion torques were closer (4.43 and 3.55 Â Nm/volt, respectively), which was expected since the foot is near symmetrical about its sagittal plane.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, an FES-assisted {{training}} strategy {{combined with}} impedance {{control for the}} lower limb rehabilitation robot is presented and the controller used to accomplish this task is developed, aiming to achieve two goals. The first one {{is to create a}} compliance environment to inspire the voluntary effort of the patient, and the second one is to provide assistance through FES rather than purely through robot. Impedance control is ideal for establishing active compliance of the robot, and through the mechanism of impedance control, the patient has to make effort to accomplish the task rather than passively waiting the assistance from the robot so that it increases the participation of the patientâ€™s voluntary effort. Two muscle groups are stimulated with FES to provide extra assistance to the patient during the training process. The intensity of the FES is properly chosen so as to induce the desired active torque which is proportional to the voluntary effort of the patient. The control of active torque of FES-stimulated muscle is achieved using the combination of a neural network-based feedforward controller and a PD feedback controller which have been proven to be competent for this task. The dynamic parameters of the leg-robot hybrid system are estimated using system identification method; the voluntary torques are also estimated according to the EMG signals acquired from the related muscle groups.

Many different controllers including fuzzy logic controller (FLC) with neglecting core loss {{have been designed to}} control the speed of {{induction motor}}. The outcome of investigation about the effect of core loss on indirect field oriented control (IFOC) has been concluded that the <b>actual</b> flux and <b>torque</b> are not reached to the reference flux and torque if core loss is neglected. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to propose a fuzzy logic speed controller of induction motor where flux and torque decoupling strategy is decoupled in terms of magnetizing current instead of stator current to alleviate the effects of core loss. The performances of proposed fuzzy-logic-based controller have been verified by computer simulation. The simulation of speed control of IM using PI and FLC are performed. The simulation study for high-performance control of IM drive shows the superiority of the proposed fuzzy logic controller over the conventional PI controller.

2500|$|For {{the final}} year, 1987, Buick {{introduced}} the Limited Production GNX, for [...] "Grand National Experimental", at $29,900. Made in partnershjp with McLaren Performance Technologies/ASC, Buick produced only 547 GNs with the interior trim package, that were then {{sent off to}} McLaren and upgraded into the Buick GNX. Buick underrated the GNX at [...] and a very substantial [...] of <b>torque</b> (<b>actual</b> output is 300hp/224kW and 420lbÂ·ft/569NÂ·m). [...] This was created to be the [...] "Grand National to end all Grand Nationals." [...] Changes made included a special Garrett T-3 turbocharger with a ceramic-impeller blowing through a more efficient and significantly larger capacity intercooler with a [...] "CERMATEL (Ceramic/Aluminum) coated" [...] pipe connecting the intercooler to the engine. A GNX specific E-EPROM, low-restriction exhaust with dual mufflers, reprogrammed Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with a custom torque converter and transmission cooler, and unique differential cover/panhard bar included more of the performance modifications. Exterior styling changes include vents located on each front fender, 16inch black mesh style wheels with VR-speed rated tires, and deletion of the hood and fender emblems. The interior changes of the GNX included a serial number on the dash plaque and a revised instrument cluster providing analog Stewart-Warner gauges, including an analog turbo boost gauge. Performance was measured faster than the Ferrari F40 and the Porsche 930 with a quarter mile time of 12.7 seconds at [...] (0.3 and 0.8 seconds quicker, 2.9 and 13.3mph faster) and a 0- time of 4.6 seconds (0.4 and 0.3 seconds quicker, respectively).|$|R
