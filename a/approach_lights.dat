5000|$|Several ALS {{configurations}} {{are recognized}} by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); however, non-standard ALS configurations are installed at some airports. Typically, <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> systems are of high-intensity. Many <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> systems are also complemented by various on-runway light systems, such as Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL), Touchdown Zone Lights (TDZL), and High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL).

25|$|On 31 August 1988, {{the right}} {{outboard}} flap of a CAAC Trident 2B operating as CAAC Flight 301 hit <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> of runway 31 of Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport while landing in rain and fog. The right {{main landing gear}} struck the seawall of the reclaimed land on which the runway was laid and was torn out, causing the aircraft to run off the runway and slip into the harbour. Seven people were killed.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, {{the report}} into the crash was {{published}} by the Interstate Aviation Committee. According to the committee, {{the primary cause of}} the incident was the crew conducting the approach in worse than the minimum meteorological conditions for the airfield, aircraft, and aircraft commander. The failure of the crew to go-around and their descent below the minimum safe altitude in the absence of visual contact with the <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> or ground references resulted in the collision with trees and controlled flight into terrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{final report}} into the {{accident}} was released in October 2010, concluding {{that the cause of}} the crash was attempting the landing approach in conditions worse than the meteorological minima of the airfield, the aircraft, and the commander. The crew failed to make a timely decision to go-around. They descended below the established minimum safe altitude in the absence of reliable visual contact with runway or <b>approach</b> <b>lights,</b> which led to a collision of the aircraft with trees and terrain. The MAK commented that had the recommendations following the crash of UTair Flight 471 been implemented, the accident may have been prevented. A total of 19 safety recommendations were made.|$|E

25|$|On 1 May 2016, China Eastern Flight 5443, an Airbus 319 {{flying from}} Chengdu to Kangding, had an aborted landing during bad weather {{at the high}} {{altitude}} airport. The aircraft hit the ground outside the runway and destroyed the <b>approach</b> <b>lights,</b> almost causing a serious crash, with damage to the tail, tires and landing gear. The aircraft safely returned to Chengdu. Two airline captains had their licences revoked and an assistant captain was suspended after {{it was found that}} the co-pilot was seated in the cabin while the assistant captain was in the cockpit. The high altitude airport requires two experienced captains to be at the controls.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, Air Stord {{started a}} route to Stavanger, which corresponded with the morning departures to London and Aberdeen in the United Kingdom. That year, the airport company went with NOK22,320 million in profit, before {{financial}} costs. In June 1993 the airport {{bought a new}} fire engine, which allowed the airport to be upgraded from Category 3 to 4, allowing larger aircraft to land. In August, Air Stord's concessions were upgraded, so they were allowed use aircraft with more than ten seats, but were at {{the time required to}} not cancel flights without due reason. In October, the municipality and county granted NOK300,000 to install new <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> for Runway 15. In 1993, the airport had a revenue of NOK3.6 million and a profit of NOK13,414. This included a NOK1.77 million grant from the state for the tower service.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 2004, Emirates Flight 764, an Airbus A340-300 {{operating}} {{a flight from}} Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it failed to become airborne {{before the end of}} the runway, striking 25 <b>approach</b> <b>lights,</b> causing four tires to burst which in turn threw debris into various parts of the aircraft, ultimately damaging the flap drive mechanism. This rendered the flaps immovable in the takeoff position. The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage. The aircraft was brought to a stop only 250 meters from the end of the 3,400 meter runway using reverse thrust and the alternative braking system. In their report, South African investigators found that the captain had used a wrong take-off technique, and criticized Emirates training and rostering practices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} the <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> for the runway were not lit {{on the night of}} the crash.

2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} was {{the crash of}} Flight 1030X on 14 April 1965. BUA (Channel Islands) Douglas C-47B-20-DK (registration: G-ANTB) was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris Orly to Jersey. Despite the deteriorating weather conditions at Jersey's States Airport, the crew decided to continue its approach to runway 27. This approach was abandoned because runway visual range fell below minima. When the aircraft made a second approach, it struck the outermost pole of the approach light system at a height of , [...] short of the runway threshold. This caused the aircraft to crash into the <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> and catch fire, which killed 26 of the 27 occupants (three out of four crew members and all 23 passengers).|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, violating {{standard}} procedures, {{the captain}} decided {{to continue the}} approach to as close as [...] to the runway and descended further to [...] and beyond, well below the MDA. At [...] off {{the threshold of the}} runway and at an altitude of [...] (which in this case constituted the decision height), the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) started to trigger aural alarms. Eight seconds later, the crew decided to abort the landing and initiated a go-around, but before being able to execute the command struck the ground with the undersurface of the fuselage and the landing gear at 20:19 EET (18:19 UTC), [...] off the threshold of runway 34 and [...] off the <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> at a speed of around [...]|$|E
2500|$|A {{board of}} inquiry {{was formed to}} {{investigate}} the accident, chaired by David Scott Cairns, QC. It opened in London on 14 April 1953. After hearing evidence, the board concluded that the pilot, Captain Hartley, made [...] "errors of judgement" [...] but that no moral blame was to be attached to him regarding the accident. The board mentioned that hitting the van stopped any chance of the aircraft reaching the runway, and then hitting the building made a tragedy inevitable. The <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> were found to not {{be at the top}} of the poles, to ease maintenance; although that was not judged a factor in the crash, the lights were moved to the top of the poles following the accident. It was also recommended that when the ILS building was rebuilt that it should be offset from the approach path, or that it should be sited underground.|$|E
