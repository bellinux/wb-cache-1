25|$|The arbitrators which {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} the dispute are called the <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunal.</b> The composition of the <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunal</b> can vary enormously, with either a sole arbitrator sitting, two or more arbitrators, with or without a chairman or umpire, and various other combinations. In most jurisdictions, an arbitrator enjoys immunity from liability for anything done or omitted whilst acting as arbitrator unless the arbitrator acts in bad faith.|$|E

50|$|International {{judicial}} {{institutions can}} be divided into courts, <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> and quasi-judicial institutions. Courts are permanent bodies, with near the same composition for each case. <b>Arbitral</b> <b>tribunals,</b> by contrast, are constituted anew for each case. Both courts and <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> can make binding decisions. Quasi-judicial institutions, by contrast, make rulings on cases, but these rulings are not in themselves legally binding; the main example is the individual complaints mechanisms available under the various UN human rights treaties.|$|R
40|$|Why do parties {{choose to}} bring {{disputes}} before <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> rather than national courts?

25|$|Like the courts, arbitral tribunals {{generally}} {{have the same}} power to award costs {{in relation to the}} determination of the dispute. In international arbitration as well as domestic arbitrations governed by the laws of countries in which courts may award costs against a losing party, the <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunal</b> will also determine the portion of the arbitrators' fees that the losing party is required to bear.|$|E

40|$|Whether <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> {{should be}} allowed to {{adjudicate}} disputes on the basis of legal grounds different from those submitted by the parties is a question that is subject to considerable debate in the international arbitration community. On the one hand, arbitration is a creature of contract and <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> should be careful not to exceed the mandate that has been extended to them by the parties. On the other hand, there may be circumstances where the ignorance of certain legal regimes may be fatal to the validity and enforceability of the award, and where the tribunal may thus well be advised to raise the applicability of such regimes even if the parties failed to do so. In order to illustrate the type of circumstances in which <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> may be well advised to raise legal grounds on an ex officio basis in order to ensure the validity and enforceability of the award, I refer to contractual disputes where the agreement under scrutiny, which one of the parties is seeking to enforce, may breach EU competition law, which according to the Eco-Swiss judgment of the CJEU belongs to public policy. This paper argues that whether <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> should raise EU competition rules on their own motion largely depends on the circumstances of each case and <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> should be guided by pragmatism rather than theoretical considerations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the evolving role of international commercial arbitration in the enforcement of domestic antitrust laws. It first explores how antitrust claims and issues arise in international arbitrations. It then describes three phases {{in the evolution of}} domestic courts’ attitude toward the adjudication of antitrust claims by international <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals.</b> Initially, national courts—like courts of the United States prior to the U. S. Supreme Court’s pathmarking 1985 decision in Mitsubishi v. Soler—were suspicious of private adjudication of antitrust claims, cognizant of the public values implicated by antitrust law. A remarkable but unnoticed transformation has since ensued. Now, the national courts of most developed economies accept (and even mandate) adjudication of antitrust claims by private international <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals.</b> This transformation may be predictive of future acceptance of international <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> as trustworthy forums for dispute resolution of other “public” subject matters. This Article concludes by suggesting how international arbitrators should discharge their new role and how domestic courts might police it...|$|R
25|$|The first {{official}} announcement of an Argentine claim of South Georgia {{was made in}} 1927 at the International Postal Bureau in Bern. The first definitive Argentine claim of sovereignty over the South Sandwich Islands was made in 1938, when the President of Argentina ratified the 1934 Cairo Postal Convention. Since then, Argentina has maintained her claims of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands but repeatedly (in 1947, 1951, 1953, 1954 and 1955) refused to have them resolved by the International Court of Justice or by an independent <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{decision}} made by the <b>Arbitral</b> <b>Tribunal</b> on Trail, disputes over air pollution between two countries had never been settled through arbitration, and the polluter pays principle had never been applied in an international context. When the Tribunal dealt with {{the details of the}} Trail Smelter Arbitration, there was no existing international law that dealt with air pollution; therefore, a law dealing with international air pollution was modelled after U.S. state laws, with the Tribunal referring to a number of cases in the U.S. that involved air pollution between multiple states.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the {{president}} of the International Court of Justice appointed Owen to act as presiding arbitrator of the <b>Arbitral</b> <b>Tribunal</b> for the Dispute Over the Inter-Entity Boundary in the Brcko Area, a special ICJ tribunal established to determine the status of the Brcko District, which had not been resolved by the Dayton Agreement. As presiding arbitrator, Owen ruled that the Brcko District would constitute a Condominium (international law) under the direct jurisdiction of the federal authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and outside the jurisdiction of either the Republika Srpska or the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the result of Owen's decision, the Brcko District became largely self-governing.|$|E
40|$|Cooling-off {{provisions}} in international investment agreements guarantee that investors and host States resolve their disputes {{in the most}} efficient manner. Aimed at offering the parties the opportunity to amicably settle their differences, cooling-off provisions remain a controversial issue in the jurisprudence on international <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals.</b> <b>Arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> are still split between considering the cooling-off provision as a procedural requirement or as an admissibility or jurisdictional requirement. Each of these positions triggers different practical consequences, with serious outcomes for the arbitral process.

40|$|Is "treaty shopping" in {{international}} investment law "legitimate nationality planning" or "treaty abuse"? This {{is the question}} investment <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunals</b> have been increasingly faced with over past years. This PhD thesis will examine in a systematic and comprehensive manner investment arbitral decisions that have attempted to draw this line.

25|$|High-Low Arbitration, or Bracketed Arbitration, is an {{arbitration}} {{wherein the}} parties to the dispute agree in advance the limits within which the <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunal</b> must render its award. It is only generally useful where liability is not in dispute, and the only issue between the party is the amount of compensation. If the award is lower than the agreed minimum, then the defendant only need pay the lower limit; if the award is higher than the agreed maximum, the claimant will receive the upper limit. If the award falls within the agreed range, then the parties are bound by the actual award amount. Practice varies as to whether the figures {{may or may not be}} revealed to the tribunal, or whether the tribunal is even advised of the parties' agreement.|$|E

After spending just one month with the team, he moved within the league to the Milwaukee Brewers, {{where he played}} for five seasons and was utilized exclusively as an outfielder from [...] onwards. In 1896, {{he was at the}} centre of controversy when the Philadelphia Phillies drafted him and promised the Brewers that they would return him should they not be in need of his services. However, he was instantly outrighted to the Detroit Tigers, with the Phillies' president acknowledging that they were assisting and collaborating with the Tigers, who had requested the transaction. The case went to an <b>arbitral</b> <b>tribunal,</b> which ruled in favour of the Brewers.|$|E
500|$|Regardless of the ship's wartime disposition, however, Proceedings {{noted in}} 1920 {{that it was}} [...] "improbable" [...] that {{construction}} would resume upon the ship. Indeed, the Greek navy {{refused to accept the}} incomplete hull, and as a result AG Vulcan sued the Greek government in 1923. A lengthy arbitration ensued. The Greek navy argued that the ship, which was designed in 1912, was now obsolete and that under the Treaty of Versailles it could not be armed by the German shipyard anyway. The Greeks requested that Vulcan return advance payments made before the war had stopped work. The dispute went before the Greco-German Mixed <b>Arbitral</b> <b>Tribunal</b> (established under Article 304 of the Treaty of Versailles), which dragged on throughout the 1920s. In 1924, a Dutch admiral was appointed by the tribunal to evaluate the Greek complaints, and he ultimately sided with Vulcan, probably in part due to Greek inquiries to Vulcan earlier that year as to the possibility of modernizing the design. Vulcan's response did not satisfy Greek requirements, so the proposal was dropped.|$|E
