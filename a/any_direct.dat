5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, {{and how much}} from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made <b>any</b> <b>direct</b> references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions.

The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Gratiot Avenue runs northeasterly through downtown, past Ford Field. Near the stadium, {{the street}} passes over I-375 (Chrysler Freeway) without <b>any</b> <b>direct</b> connections.

Gratiot continues past the freeway on the city's east side, bordering residential neighborhoods along the way. Through this area, it had a continuous center turn lane, losing the grassy median it had in places downtown. The highway intersects Grand Boulevard near Dueweke Park, and at Van Dyke Avenue, it intersects the southern end of M-53. Gratiot Avenue crosses I-94 at the latter's exit219 near the Coleman A. Young International Airport and an adjacent industrial area.|$|E

However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without <b>any</b> <b>direct</b> involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E

5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that <b>any</b> <b>direct</b> peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
