40|$|Abstract: A {{potential}} flow {{model has been}} used for the theoretical prediction of the gas velocity field around a sampling probe. Results given by a proper numerical solution have been compared in a limit condition with those obtained from experimental measurements, showing a good agreement, in view of the number of simplifying hypoteses assumed and of the uncertainties due to the small scale experimental situation. The isokinetic calibration of a specimen probe, here reported, puts into evidence the practical difficulties to achieve isokinetic operation; then calibration curves for concentration ratios in <b>anisokinetic</b> operation have to be used, given here as obtained from particle trajectory calculation. Finally, the capability of <b>anisokinetic</b> operation to give more information, if the particle velocity near the probe intake is also measured, is emphasized, on the base of the particle approach velocity analysis...|$|E
40|$|An <b>anisokinetic</b> {{shrouded}} nozzle system {{was designed for}} sampling particles at a constant low flow rate from a ventilation duct to an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS). Shrouded <b>anisokinetic</b> nozzles are a means for sampling from a moving airstream with higher particle transmission than with unshrouded isokinetic nozzles. This {{shrouded nozzle}} sampling system was evaluated in an experimental ventilation duct system. Aspiration and transport efficiency measurements were made for five particle sizes in the range 1 - 13 μm at each of three duct air speeds in the range 2. 2 - 8. 8 m/s. Under these conditions, the shrouded nozzle system showed improved performance compared to buttonhook isokinetic nozzles, especially for larger particles and higher air speeds. Measured transmission efficiencies through the shrouded nozzle sampling system were generally higher and more reliably predictable than those through buttonhook isokinetic nozzles. Model predictions of transport and aspiration efficiencies of the shrouded nozzle system showed good agreement with measurements over {{the entire range of}} experimental conditions. The shrouded nozzle sampling system could be used to measure concentrations in ventilation ducts with an APS for particles in the diameter range 1 - 13 μm.

40|$|In situ {{aircraft}} measurements in {{the lower}} stratosphere are used to investigate the reactive nitrogen, NO(y), total water, and particle components of the polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) aerosol in the Arctic. The results are compared to findings from the Antarctic derived using similar measurements and interpretive techniques. The Arctic data show that particle volume well above background values is present at temperatures above the frostpoint, confirming the result from the Antarctic that the observed PSCs are not water ice particles. NO(y) measurements inside a PSC are enhanced above ambient values consistent with <b>anisokinetic</b> sampling of particles containing NO(y). In the Arctic data over long segments of several flights, calculations show saturation with respect to nitric acid trihydrate without significant PSC particle growth above background...|$|E
40|$|A focused cavity aerosol {{spectrometer}} {{aboard a}} NASA ER- 2 high-altitude aircraft provided high-resolution {{measurements of the}} size of the stratospheric particles in the 0. 06 - 2. 0 -micrometer-diameter range in flights following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Effects of <b>anisokinetic</b> sampling and evaporation in the sampling system were accounted for by means adapted and specifically developed for this instrument. Calibrations with monodisperse aerosol particles provided the instrument's response matrix, which upon inversion during data reduction yielded the particle size distributions. The resultant dataset is internally consistent and generally shows agreement to within a factor of 2 with comparable measurements simultaneously obtained by a condensation nuclei counter, a forward-scattering spectrometer probe, and aerosol particle impactors, as well as with nearby extinction profiles obtained by satellite measurements and with lidar measurements of backscatter...|$|E
40|$|During the Polar Stratospheric Aerosol Experiment, total {{water was}} {{measured}} using an airborne Lyman-alpha fluorescence hygrometer. The inlet is designed for <b>anisokinetic</b> sampling, thus large ice particles are detected sensitively. During the flight on January 24, 1997, temperatures of 200 K occurred close to the tropopause. Within this cold area, the existence of large particles with radii {{greater than or equal}} to 4 mu m containing large amounts of water is observed. At the edge of this cloud, total water mixing ratios of 5 - 6 ppmv and close to saturation were measured at and below the tropopause. This observation together with analysis of the correlation of the H 2 O mixing ratio with other long-lived tracers indicates that the air masses had been dried by sedimentation of large ice particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} an {{adequate}} sampling from slurry handling equipment {{is present in}} many branches of the chemical and related industries. It is often very important to know the solid concentration and the particle size distribution in the apparatus of this kind, {{in order to control}} and operate them. For this purpose, wall sampling is widely adopted in industrial practice for its simplicity and versatility. Serious errors in measuring solids concentration can arise from unsuitable sampling. This work reports the main factors that may cause these deviations from ideal wall sampling during work with slurry handling equipment. Up to now, some authors have thoroughly studied the problem of isokinetic and <b>anisokinetic</b> sampling from slurry pipelines, both theoretically and experimentally. However, little work was dedicated to the withdrawal of solid suspensions from stirred vessels. The main sources of sampling errors occur because of particle inertia, particle bouncing effects and flow structure ahead of the sampling device. The results of experimental work of different authors indicate that the solid concentration in the sample, i. e. sampling efficiency, depends strongly on the sample tube design, withdrawal velocity and sampling device location as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{work done}} on this grant {{primarily}} concerns {{the measurement of}} aerosol in the stratosphere from NASA ER- 2 aircraft in studies of stratospheric ozone depletion in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. The ER- 2 Condensation Nucleus Counter (CNC) measures the number concentration of particles in the diameter range of approximately 0. 01 to 1 micron. The Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer measures size distributions in the 0. 17 to 3 micron diameter range. This instrument was upgraded during this grant period to a Focused Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer (FCAS). This upgrade permitted the instrument to measure particles as small as 0. 05 micron in diameter. The inlet for the PCAS and FCAS was modified and characterized under this grant so that the modifications to the aerosol due to <b>anisokinetic</b> sampling and heating upon sampling and in transport to the measurement location were accounted for in the data analysis. These measurements permitted observations of particle production in the southern hemisphere winter polar vortex and observation of the impact of denitrification on the number concentration of the aerosol in the denitrified air. In the northern polar vortex, the measurements provided a characterization of the sulfate aerosol. Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the measurements permitted an accurate characterization of the sulfate aerosol enhancements resulting from the eruption. This led to studies of the impact of heterogeneous chemistry on the partitioning of the partitioning of the reactive nitrogen species and the partitioning of the chlorine reservoir...|$|E
40|$|During a {{campaign}} to study ozone loss mechanisms in the Arctic stratosphere (SOLVE), several instruments on NASA 2 ̆ 7 s ER· 2 aircraft obser ved a very low number density (0. 1 I-I) of large, nitric-acid-containing particles that form the polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). For effective physical and chemical characterization of these particles, the measurements from these instruments have to be intercompared and integrated. In particular, proper interpretation requires knowledge of the sampling characteristics of the particles into the instruments. Here, we present the calculation of the sampling characteristics of {{the one of the}} instruments on the ER- 2, the NOAA NOy instrument. This instrument sampled ambient particles and gas from two forward-facing inlets located fore and aft on a particle-separation housing (the football) and measured total NOy in the sample. In recent studies, ambient aero sol mass has been estimated by the difference of the measurements of the two inlets with the assumption that the rear inlet observation s represent the gas-phase NOy and small particles and the front inlet samples represent gas-phase NOy and all particle sizes with varied efficiency (<b>anisokinetic</b> sampling). This knowledge was derived largelyfrom semiempirical relations and potential flow studies of the housing. In our study, we usedCFD simulations to model the compressible flow conditions and considered noncontinuum effects in calculating particle trajectories. Our simulations show that the blunt body housing the inlets has a strong and complex interaction with the flow and particles sampled by the two inlets. The simulations show that the front inlet characteristics are influenced by the effect of the blunt body on the upstream pres sure field. The rear inlet sampling characteristics are influenced both by the shape and size of the inlet and its location on the blunt body. These interaction s result in calculated inlet characteristics that are significantly different from previously assumed values. Analysis of the SOLVE data, considering the ambient conditions and the calculated inlet sampling characteristics, in conjunction with thermodynamic growth modeling of super-cooled ternary solution (STS) particles, provides validation of the CFD results...|$|E
