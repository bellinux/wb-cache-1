5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet they had made. After arguing for several minutes, Griffen pulled <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E
5|$|At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took {{advantage}} of the airport security by stuffing <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> deep into his hat and then placing his hat on a table adjacent to the scanner. The security guards were not as strict as now since the incident took place before 9/11 and they allowed Demeke to pass.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> self-loading <b>pistol</b> reloads {{the chamber}} {{with a new}} round {{automatically}} each time the weapon is fired, without additional action being required by the user. For <b>a</b> semi-automatic <b>pistol,</b> this is typically accomplished by recoil operation. In <b>a</b> machine <b>pistol,</b> in contrast, {{this can be accomplished}} by blowback, or, less commonly, by gas operation, harnessing gases produced when the gun is fired. The Desert Eagle is a rare example of <b>a</b> semi-automatic <b>pistol</b> that siphons off some of the gases instead of relying on short recoil operation.|$|R

5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with a rock and <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns.

5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public {{carrying}} <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E

Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801 he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the crowd with <b>a</b> <b>pistol.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis {{to take a second}} aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire <b>a</b> <b>pistol</b> at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was {{riding in a}} carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|E
