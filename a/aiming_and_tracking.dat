40|$|The {{ability to}} control head {{movements}} determines the performance of head-mounted sights. A literature review {{and the results of}} a number of laboratory experiments investigating head <b>aiming</b> <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> performance are presented. The literature review (the results of which are included as a table) revealed that tracking performance may be degraded by in-flight conditions. The experiments measured the frequency response of the head tracking system and systematically investigated, under laboratory conditions, the effects on performance of some of the variables which may be present in an operational environment. These included off-bore-sight target angle, helmet weight, seating conditions, the amplitude and axis of target motion, and reticle size and shape. It was shown that these variables had a relatively minor effect on performance. It is recommended that the influence of other relevant in-flight variables, such as the restriction due to clothing and personal equipment and the effects of whole-body vibration, should be investigated.

40|$|Force {{feedback}} devices {{support the}} human operator {{in terms of}} teleoperation or telerobotic. In addition to visual and acoustic information, haptic feedback may significantly improve performance, if relevant mechanical properties are applied appropriately. Not only users on earth but also in space {{will benefit from the}} advantages of force feedback systems. For that matter the major challenge consists of the adaptation of mechanical properties to microgravity and the effects on the human body. Consequently, this thesis provides basic insights for future investigations of perception and performance of mechanical properties at the International Space Station (ISS). Overall, 22 people participated in a psychophysical perception task and performed 18 <b>aiming</b> <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> tasks which combined different levels of stiffness, damping and inertia with a force feedback joystick under conditions of regular terrestrial gravity (1 g). Results indicate that the task-related combinations of different levels of stiffness and damping are advantagous. However, inertia hardly has any influence on the performance. Fast movements can be conducted best without stiffness and damping. A combination of medium stiffness and damping reveals beneficial effects on precise aiming. High stiffness and available damping facilitate smooth movements, reduce overshoots and enable precise tracking of a moving target. In addition, the direction of movement has a large influence on fine motor performance due to biomechanical characteristics of the human hand arm system. The relevance of results and the impact on further investigations and applications are discussed...|$|E

The paper employs as a research approach a literature review of the BSC. This study is framed as follows: review of the literature on the BSC and its aims; analysis of the use of the BSC by the university administration, given their multidimensional performances; finally, development of a model to suit University context. The model, applied to an Italian University identifies contemporary reporting practices and gaps in universities.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to gain insight into the effects of precision demands and mental pressure on the load of the upper extremity. Two computer mouse tasks were used: an <b>aiming</b> <b>and</b> a <b>tracking</b> task. Upper extremity loading was operationalized as the myo-electric activity of the wrist flexor and extensor and of the trapezius descendens muscles and the applied grip- and click-forces on the computer mouse. Performance measures, reflecting the accuracy in both tasks and the clicking rate in the aiming task, indicated that the levels of the independent variables resulted in distinguishable levels of accuracy and work pace. Precision demands had a small effect on upper extremity loading with a significant increase in the EMG-amplitudes (21 %) of the wrist flexors during the aiming tasks. Precision had large effects on performance. Mental pressure had substantial effects on EMG-amplitudes with an increase of 22 % in the trapezius when <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> increases of 41 % in the trapezius and 45 % and 140 % in the wrist extensors and flexors, respectively, when aiming.

Autonomous PTZ cameras mainly <b>aim</b> to detect <b>and</b> <b>track</b> targets with the largest possible resolution. Autonomous PTZ operation is activated once the network detects and identifies an object as sensible target and requires accurate control of the PTZ parameters and coordination among the cameras in the network.
