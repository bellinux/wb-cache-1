50|$|Sonic tools, {{such as the}} Baker Hughes XMAC-F1, {{consist of}} {{multiple}} piezoelectric transducers and receivers mounted on the tool body at fixed distances. The transmitters generate a pattern of sound waves at varying operating frequencies into the down hole formation. The signal path leaves the transmitter, passes through the mud column, travels along the borehole wall and is collected at multiple receivers spaced out along the tool body. The {{time it takes for}} the sound wave to travel through the rock is dependent on a number of properties of the existing rock, including formation porosity, lithology, permeability and rock strength. Different types of pressure waves can be generated in specific axis, allowing geoscientists to determine <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> regimes.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} effect of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> state on {{intermediate}} strain properties of cylindrical samples containing spherical glass particles. Tests were carried out with the modified resonant column device available at Ruhr-Universität Bochum. Dry samples were subjected to two <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> states: (a) cell pressure, σ′h, constant and vertical stress, σ′v, increased (stress state GB-I) and (b) σ′v/σ′h equal to 2 (stress state GB-II). The experimental results revealed that {{the effect of}} stress state GB-II on the modulus and damping ratio was more significant and obvious than stress state GB-I. The effect of the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> state was explained through the impact of confining pressure and <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> components on the stiffness and damping ratio. The results showed that: (a) G(γ) increased, η(γ) decreased and their strain non-linearity decreased with an increase in the confining pressure component σ′vσ′h; (b) G(γ) decreased, η(γ) increased and their strain non-linearity increased with an increase in the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> component, σ′v/σ′h. The analysis of results revealed that reference shear strain was also affected by <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> state. Therefore, an empirical relationship was developed to predict the reference shear strain, as a function of confining pressure and <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> components. Additionally, the damping ratio was written {{as a function of the}} minimum damping ratio and the reference shear strain...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> of a purely geometrical origin {{seems to be}} a characteristic of higher order gravity models, and has been suggested as a probe to test these models observationally, for example in weak lensing experiments. In this paper, we seek to find a class of higher order gravity models of f(R,G) type that would give us a zero <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> and study the consequences for the viability of the actual model. For the special case of a de Sitter background, we identify a subclass of models with the desired property. We also find a direct link between <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> and the stability of the model as well as the presence of extra degrees of freedom, which {{seems to be a}} general feature of higher order gravity models. Particularly, setting the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> equal to zero for a de Sitter background leads to a singularity that makes it impossible to reach the de Sitter evolution.

40|$|An {{analytic}} {{formula is}} {{given for the}} traceless transverse part of the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> tensor due to free streaming neutrinos, and used to derive an integro-differential equation for the propagation of cosmological gravitational waves. The solution shows that <b>anisotropic</b> <b>stress</b> reduces the squared amplitude by 35. 6 % for wavelengths that enter the horizon during the radiation-dominated phase, independent of any cosmological parameters.

At the longest wavelengths the decrease in the tensor correlation functions due to neutrino free streaming ranges from 10. 7 % for ΩMh 2 = 0. 1 to 9. 0 % for ΩMh 2 = 0. 15.
