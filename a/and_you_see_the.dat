To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself.

500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
2500|$|Springfield {{introduced}} the Motown sound {{to a wider}} UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs, and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, and Stevie Wonder on {{a special edition of}} the Ready Steady Go! show – which was produced by Wickham – called The Sound of Motown. On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening when you go out there <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> house is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All I See Is You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20. In August and September 1966, she hosted Dusty, a six-part music and talk show weekly BBC TV series. A compilation of her singles, Golden Hits released in November 1966, reached No.2 in the UK. From the mid-1960s, Springfield would use the pseudonym [...] "Gladys Thong" [...] when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair co-wrote [...] "I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] with Lesley Duncan, which appeared as the B-side of [...] "Goin' Back." ...|$|E
