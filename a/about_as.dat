5|$|Generally the {{jumping spider}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes the}} genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can.

The main eyes of a Portia can also identify features of the scenery up to 85times its own body length, which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E

5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated <b>about</b> <b>as</b> {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E
