The 27 sculptures were supposed to represent the starving people in the Third World countries that {{are influenced by the}} way that the summit focuses on corporations' profit, instead of poor peoples' interests. The event was arranged in co-operation with Care-Denmark and The Salvation Army. The latter organization supplied the boys with Adidas, Nike and Reebok shoes.|$|R
40|$|On 11 September 2006 {{the leaders}} of 38 Asian and European {{countries}} and the President of the European Commission concluded the <b>ASEM</b> 6 <b>summit</b> in Helsinki. The ASEM-Process, initiated in 1996, has often been criticised for not achieving its full agenda-setting potential in global negations in the issue-areas of trade and finance. Despite these shortcomings, the Asia-Europe Meeting seeks to brush up on its meagre contribution to global discourses by setting up a virtual secretariat {{as a means to}} mould common positions. A case in point is the Declaration on Climate Change, which is a clear indication of an improved multilateral utility of ASEM. Yet, informality and frequent clashes of European and Asian conceptions of cooperation weaken the potential negotiation power of the Asia-Europe Meeting...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{issues from}} {{a conference on}} ‘Civil Society and Accountable Global Governance’, {{organised}} by Jan Aart Scholte in May 2007. It examines the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) {{and the role of}} parallel summitry that has established itself on the margins of the official biennial gathering. Now comprising thirty five ‘cooperation partners’ from the regions of Europe and East Asia, <b>ASEM</b> <b>summits,</b> and the many other meetings in its name, focus on a host of issue areas for cooperation, from the further development of ICT to climate change and anti-terrorism. However, while business groups and trade unions are accommodated within the formal structures of ASEM, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are not. Nevertheless, the Asia-Europe People’s Forum (AEPF) has established itself alongside the summitry process, {{and the ways in which}} it has been able to influence government actions within ASEM to date have been contingent upon the particular structural conditions in which they have had to function. In demonstrating the tensions and opportunities inherent in the interregional space created by ASEM, this paper claims that accountability, itself a contested concept, is shaped by the structural frames of reference of agents, by their (power) relationships with one another and by both the internal and external mechanisms available to them to ensure accountability. As ASEM has yet to allow the formal inclusion of NGOs within its framework, claims and consultation to date have been conducted on the edges of the official track. In addition, the multitude of NGO types within the AEPF make it difficult to reach consensus and to organise difference. This difference also implicates and reinforces different levels of influence by NGO participants and highlights the fact that different NGOs may approach their remit quite differently. In addition, the ASEM process embeds an Asian versus European participation that is mirrored within AEPF, with the result that at times in the civil society realm, too, there is evidence to suggest that the structure can bring into conflict Asian versus European ways of doing business. Can accountability be ensured within structures whose modes may not be conducive to transparency and scrutiny? And what claims can the NGO community make for its own accountability? The conclusion examines whether the existing paradigm of civic engagement sets up an impossible hurdle for the establishment of open and accountable policy making behaviour within ASEM...|$|R

Ultimately on 15 July 2016, the Agreement on Visa Abolition for Diplomatic/Official Passport Holders & the Air Services Agreement were concluded on the sidelines of 11th <b>ASEM</b> <b>Summit</b> in Mongolia.|$|E
50|$|In {{support of}} the {{official}} Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process and the 9th <b>ASEM</b> <b>Summit</b> {{to be held in}} Vientiane, the EU Centre teamed up with the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF) and National Library Board (NLB) to put together an Exhibition entitled “Connected Histories, Shared Future” showcasing the work done by ASEF and EU Centre to bring about greater connections and exchanges between Asia and Europe.|$|E
50|$|In March 1996, {{the leaders}} of 25 Asian and European countries, {{together}} with the European Commission, met in Bangkok, Thailand, for the 1st Asia-Europe Meeting (<b>ASEM)</b> <b>Summit.</b> At this inaugural meeting, they agreed on {{the establishment of the}} Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF) in 1997 as a central institution of ASEM's social, cultural and educational pillar. One of the main tasks of ASEF is to become an interface between civil society groups and governments by facilitating interactions among people from diverse fields and transmitting the resulting outputs as recommendations to policy-makers.|$|E
50|$|The Exhibition {{was inaugurated}} at the National Library Building in Singapore by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister of Singapore from 1991 - 2004) on 17 May 2012. The Exhibition was on {{displayed}} {{for a month}} at the Main Central Library of the NLB before travelling to four other locations in Singapore - to the Jurong Regional Library, Woodlands Regional Library, NTU Lee Wee Nam Library and NUS Central Library each for 3-4 weeks. As the centrepiece and final destination for 2012, the Exhibition was brought to Vientiane, Laos in November 2012 and set up at the National Convention Centre, where 51 leaders from Asia and Europe were convening for the 9th <b>ASEM</b> <b>Summit.</b> The Exhibition was also viewed by the ASEM senior officials prior to the Leaders meeting.|$|E
50|$|After the Oyu Tolgoi {{investment}} {{agreement was}} signed in 2009 {{the first phase of}} the Mongolian mining boom started. Ulaanbaatar as the capital of the country came to be labelled one of the world's top frontier investment destinations. From 2009 to 2012 Ulaanbaatar's position rapidly rose in the investment world. Miners and bankers flocked to the city as construction and other sectors boomed. In September 2011 Ulaanbaatar was featured on CNNGo TV - the same year Mongolia had the fastest GDP growth in the world at 17.3%. Developments in the Mongolian parliament in Ulaanbaatar came to be closely watched by foreign investors. The pace of growth slowed after the passing of SEFIL (Strategic Entities Foreign Investment Law) in 2012. Although the law was amended in 2013 the pace of growth has yet to return to previous boom levels. In the meantime Ulaanbaatar has been steadily increasing its international profile on a political and international relations level. Ulaanbaatar has been receiving regular OSCE delegations after Mongolia became a participating state of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe in November 2012. In April 2013 Ulaanbaatar (as capital of the country holding presidency) successfully hosted the 7th Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies attended by 1,215 delegates from 104 countries. Aung San Suu Kyi was one of the attendees. It has also hosted the North Korea-Japan talks on abduction issues. In November 2013 Ulaanbaatar organized the first Meeting of Women Parliamentarians of Northeast Asian Countries. In June 2014 it hosted the first international conference of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security. In August 2014 Ulaanbaatar hosted the Northeast Asian Mayors' Forum and became sister cities with Beijing. In August and September 2014 Ulaanbaatar was visited by both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. In 2016 Ulaanbaatarwill host the 11th Asia Europe Meeting (<b>ASEM</b> <b>Summit).</b> Ulaanbaatar also started hosting international music concerts in large stadiums. Michael Learns to Rock, ONYX and the Korean K-pop group T-ara have all performed in Ulaanbaatar. Previously only little known Russian pop stars used to come. The city has become increasingly Anglophone and English signs are common on streets and billboards. Korean culture also has a strong influence in the city as reflected in the numerous Korean businesses in the city center and the adoption of Korean styles among a large number of urban youth. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Mongolia on 16 May 2015.|$|E
40|$|The 6 th <b>ASEM</b> <b>summit,</b> held {{a decade}} after the {{beginning}} of the process which gives it its name, constituted a unique opportunity to make an assessment of its achievements as well as to establish new principles to allow the process to go forward. According to the article, three aspects may be considered as the main results of the summit: the adoption of global challenges as the main focus of the Asia-Europe dialogue, the improvement of the working methods and the second enlargement...|$|E
40|$|What role do {{state and}} non-state actors {{play in the}} in the {{negotiation}} process on the protection of human rights in the Southeast Asian region? Is there an interaction between both types of players or is the ASEM Dialogue still dominated by state parties? And does the discussion of human rights within the ASEM Dialogue actually lead to more protection of these rights within the region of Southeast Asia? These are the research questions I have tried to answer in this paper on the ASEM Dialogue as an example of multilateral, international negotiation. Human rights are a controversial issue and have caused a sometimes troublesome relation between the European and East Asia continents. The case of Burma/Myanmar is a clear example in which both sides were, more or less, clear opponents. The {{reason for this is that}} the East Asian states have tried to keep the issue of human rights off the official ASEM agenda, while the European states were in favour of dealing with the issue in the Summits. Nonstate actors, like non-governmental organisations have held parallel sessions on general issues on the ASEM agenda, but have also organised specific meetings on human rights issues. Asian states have tried to prevent these parallel sessions from taking place, and have limited the possible role of non-governmental organisations in general, using a similar argument as for preventing the human rights dialogue. Despite these restraints, a slow increase in the role that NGOs can play in the region is occurring. The <b>ASEM</b> <b>Summit</b> can function as a legitimization for these non-state actors to increase their influence. And the European states should use this trend to get the issue of human rights discussed during the Summits, by letting the NGOs lobby for it. Through this interaction with European states, NGOs can increase their effectiveness and hopefully increase the level of human rights protection...|$|E
40|$|Global {{economic}} power is shifting rapidly to Asia, now the EU's most important trade partner. The EU has a vital {{stake in the}} peace and security of Asia as few of its policy goals, including climate change and preservation of the multilateral system, can be achieved without the positive engagement of Asia. This {{is even more important}} because of the attitude of President Trump to Asia and global affairs. The EU thus needs to give greater priority to Asia and develop a more coherent policy approach. Growth rates in Asia have outstripped those in the EU and US for many years. Projected economic growth of 5. 5 per cent this year in the Asia-Pacific region is far ahead of the 2. 1 per cent and 1. 9 per cent projected in the US and the EU, respectively. With economic clout comes political influence, which means that the EU has {{to pay more attention to}} Asia to achieve its own policy goals, whether in trade, climate change, migration, or terrorism. The EU has to prioritise and should concentrate on its strategic partners (China, Japan, India, and South Korea) and support for ASEAN. The withdrawal of the US from the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) offers the EU an opportunity. The policy of bilateral free trade agreements with selected partners should be continued as there is little prospect of any region-to-region agreement. The EU has a major stake in Asian security as any conflict would immediately impact global supply chains. It should do more to tackle "hot spots," such as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Myanmar, and emphasise its integrated approach to security, as demonstrated in Operation Atalanta. The EU should not give up its normative agenda but should promote it in a more sensitive and realistic manner. The EU could also do more to help resolve the historical disputes in Asia, including paying more attention to its own historical role in the region. With the multilateral system under threat from the Trump presidency, the EU needs to engage more with Asia to secure its policy goals. It should revitalise its strategic partnerships as the centrepiece of a new Asia strategy. At the Asia-Europe Meeting (<b>ASEM)</b> <b>summit</b> in Brussels in 2018, the EU should highlight its commitment to a stronger partnership with Asia. While trade will still be at the centre of EU-Asia relations, the agenda needs to be expanded to include a range of global issues...|$|E
40|$|This CEPS Policy Brief {{is based}} on a larger study for the EEAS and European Commission, written by the same authors in the run-up of the Milan <b>ASEM</b> <b>summit</b> of 16 - 17 October 2014. The main idea of the study is to assess whether ASEM works and how, by verifying the factual {{evidence}} in detail. After all, ASEM has no institutions, no budget and no treaty, whilst dialogues and a loose improvement over time in Asia-Europe relations refer to process much more than genuine ‘results’. The stocktaking covers all ASEM activities since the 2006 Helsinki summit. Summit and foreign ministers’ declarations and ASEM calendar of activities (and interviews) are used to trace ASEM activities in the three ASEM pillars (political, economic, and peoples-to-peoples/cultural). All the ‘regular’ ASEM meetings at ministerial and other levels (many of which are only known to relatively few) have been mapped. Also the ASEM working methods, based on the 2000 AECF framework and many subsequent initiatives, have been scrutinised, including whether they are actually implemented or not or partially. Such methods refer to how to work together in areas of cooperation (beyond the typical ASEM dialogue), organisation, coordination and ASEM visibility. The main conclusion is that ASEM works reasonably well, once one accepts the ASEM of today, although some inefficiencies still characterise the ‘system’. There is a host of secondary conclusions on the three pillars, the foreign ministers, the strong government-to-government nature of ASEM and the working methods. We recommend that today’s ASEM needs no reform and that not having ASEM would entail political and diplomatic costs. We emphasise that ASEM is well placed to stimulate exchange of information between the mega-FTAs such as TPP, RCEP and TTIP. However, the ASEM of tomorrow might be different, given the great changes in geo-political and economic conditions since ASEM began in the mid- 1990 s. Moreover, the size of ASEM has become such that classical ways of operating with (after Milano) 53 countries (including the EU and ASEAN) cannot possibly be effective all the time. We suggest that, {{in the run-up to the}} 20 th ASEM birthday (2016), EU and Asian independent think-tanks get together to write an ‘options report’ reconsidering options for a new ASEM, as the basis for a profound and wide debate how to get more value-added out of ASEM...|$|E

It has been a very interesting and tragic period for Europe over the last month. The UK voted to leave the EU in its Referendum, Its Prime Minister resigned and Teresa May has taken over as the Second female Conservative Prime Minister and formed a new government. The UK Economy took an initial battering in world markets but seems to have settled down now as global players perceive there are advantages and disadvantages for the UK in being in the EU, but the main thing is stability in global markets. It will also speed-up reform of the EU and its institutions, so this may be advantageous. We have also seen a sharp increase in horrific terror atrocities in Europe, notably France, Belgium and Germany which has pointed to the need for more effective management of our freedoms and security of our citizens. It has been a difficult Summer for Europe. We hope and pray that stability and safety will return as without that society will not be based on a balanced platform to provide for all We are also seeing the emergence of the two contenders for the US Presidency, Donald Trump versus Hilary Clinton. The non-establishment business candidate versus the female long serving politician and social reformer. Cleveland and Philadelphia have all given us insights into what is coming.
