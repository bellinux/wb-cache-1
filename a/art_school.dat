Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the <b>Art</b> <b>School</b> incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an <b>art</b> <b>school</b> professor.
