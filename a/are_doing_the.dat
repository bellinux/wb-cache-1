A band of {{survivors}} reveal that they lured the creatures {{to eradicate the}} Tolmekians, and <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same to the Valley. They capture Nausicaä to prevent her from warning the Valley, but {{with the help of}} Asbel and his mother, Nausicaä escapes on a glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohm into the Valley using a wounded baby Ohm. The Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior against them, but their tanks cannot stop Ohm, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.|$|E
5|$|The next scene {{shows the}} {{sarcophagus}} with Constantina, {{the daughter of}} the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown. She has been afflicted with leprosy, and heard of the vision at Agnes' tomb, and come to pray there. The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source). In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").|$|E

25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action <b>done</b> by <b>the</b> sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action <b>done</b> previously by <b>the</b> sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works before someone else started to sing.|$|R

500|$|Composers Morten Sørlie, Tor Linløkken, and Bjørn Arve Lagim {{created the}} soundtrack and music of Anarchy Online. [...] Using a system they call [...] "Sample-based Interactive Music", the game mixes {{numerous}} music samples to create dynamic music. [...] By starting, stopping, fading, and layering samples based {{on where the}} player is, and what they <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>the</b> game creates a continuous stream of background music. Bjørn Arve Lagim stated the music is inspired by the [...] "traditional sound" [...] of a film score, using both orchestral and electronic instruments. Longer full-length versions of some songs were later released on compact disc with {{a special edition of}} the game in 2002.|$|E

We're getting a little bit more intimate and personal with this next initiative we <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>The</b> time has come for something more natural and emotional."

Later in the video, the ground under her rises to his level, and they sing to each other. Then various people are shown stopping what they <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>the</b> ground under them also rises to the sky, and they join the duo. The video closes with everyone dancing and having a good time on their respective towers. After its release, the clip amassed 250,000 views in 48 hours which, according to Wiwibloggs, is [...] "amazing for a Eurovision video". Honciuc, a writer on the same website, reacted favourably to the music video saying, [...] "The visuals highlight the positive message of the song but also the beauty of Cluj Napoca, Ilinca's hometown that serves as a backdrop." [...] ESC Covers's Ian Fowell called it [...] "charming".|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> ... <b>the</b> majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E

A {{good example of this}} is found in the computer mainframe, which is accessible from the police headquarters. When the player uploads their KIA data into the mainframe, any evidence collected by other Blade Runners is automatically downloaded into the player's KIA. This tends to be random, with different pieces of evidence discovered by different Blade Runners becoming available at different times of the game.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{research}} on memory and aging {{has focused on}} how older adults perform worse at a particular memory task. [...] However, researchers have also discovered that simply saying that older adults <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same thing, only less of it, is not always accurate. [...] In some cases, older adults seem to be using different strategies than younger adults. [...] For example, brain imaging studies have revealed that older adults {{are more likely to}} use both hemispheres when completing memory tasks than younger adults. In addition, older adults sometimes show a positivity effect when remembering information, which seems to be a result of the increased focus on regulating emotion seen with age. For instance, eye tracking reveals that older adults showed preferential looking toward happy faces and away from sad faces.|$|E
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> {{same thing over and over}} again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way.

2500|$|The various monographs {{thus are}} not {{attempts}} to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze's peculiar readings aim {{to enact the}} creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice. A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's Study after Velázquez—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon [...] "gets Velasquez wrong". Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, pace critics such as Alan Sokal: [...] "I'm not saying that Resnais and Prigogine, or Godard and Thom, <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And {{the same goes for}} philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January, as {{countries}} jockeyed to make large donations, Jan Egeland said, [...] "I'd {{rather see}} competitive compassion than no compassion", adding {{that too many}} countries were making pledges without any guarantee that the funds would arrive. Following the earthquake the previous year in Iran in Bam which killed 26,000 people, Iranian officials claimed to have received just US$17.5 million of the US$1 billion originally pledged. In mid-March 2005, the Asian Development Bank reported that the provision of over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka criticised the nations and organisations that clamoured to pledge donations, [...] "Not a penny had come through yet.
