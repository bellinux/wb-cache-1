40|$|Abstract: Introduction: The {{restoration}} material {{commonly used}} as core material for pulpless posterior teeth is mostly <b>amalgam</b> {{due to its}} high strength and low cost {{and it can be}} used with or without pin. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of post material on stress distribution in mandibular second premolar tooth by finite element analysis. Method: The stress distribution was analyzed in <b>amalgam</b> core supported with and without pin. Three dimensional plane strain models of the human mandibular second premolar were first made with pin <b>amalgam</b> and then with post <b>amalgam.</b> After applying the loading force at 45 degree angel, the stress distribution was analyzed in models. Results: Maximum stress in pin <b>amalgam</b> was more than that in post <b>amalgam.</b> The area of maximum stress in pin <b>amalgam</b> was at pin and core interface but in post <b>amalgam</b> it was at the margin of core in the side of applied force. The least stress was at the margin of core opposite to the side of force in both models and was more in pin <b>amalgam</b> than post <b>amalgam.</b> Conclusion: As the stress was more in pin <b>amalgam</b> than post <b>amalgam</b> so it can be said that the fracture strength of post <b>amalgam</b> is more than pin <b>amalgam.</b> Since crown increases fracture resistance of post and core, further studies for analysing stress distribution of <b>amalgam</b> core with crown is recommended.

40|$|Symptoms {{experienced}} by {{patients who have}} dental <b>amalgam</b> fillings have often been studied. Due to the inability to prove toxic and allergic effects on patients with <b>amalgam</b> fillings, attempts to explain these rather unspecific symptoms have been made. One such explanation lies in the general concept patients with <b>amalgam</b> fillings have toward oral hygiene and health. Some studies {{have come to the}} conclusion that patients feeling threatened from <b>amalgam</b> have a higher conscience of materials used in their dental care and are more prone to have related <b>amalgam</b> symptoms. As part of this thesis, further analysis is made towards defining if this behaviour is specific to those with <b>amalgam</b> fillings, or if also patients without <b>amalgam</b> are affected. To this effect, the behaviour of patients with <b>amalgam</b> fillings was studied. Their oral hygiene, aesthetic conscience, caries prophylaxis and their conception of <b>amalgam</b> as well as the need for information on <b>amalgam</b> fillings was compared to that of patients with other types of tooth fillings. A significant difference in behaviour toward oral hygiene between patients with <b>amalgam</b> fillings and those without <b>amalgam</b> fillings could not be proven in this analysis. No differences between patients with and without <b>amalgam</b> fillings could be identified in regards to the belief that <b>amalgam</b> could be hazardous. This has therefore been ruled out as a cause for related symptoms. The general opinion over <b>amalgam</b> was found to be negative, whether patients had had <b>amalgam</b> fillings or not. For this reason the overall conception of <b>amalgam</b> arising from the patients that were studied, can be interpreted as a general anxiety toward the use of <b>amalgam.</b> This anxiety is present in many people today, although most do not suffer from any physical symptoms related to or arising from the use of <b>amalgam</b> fillings...|$|R
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury <b>amalgams,</b> and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Mercury is an {{ingredient}} in dental <b>amalgams.</b> Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound {{used as a}} preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline.

40|$|Aim: In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} tooth preparation, yet provide additional retention to compromised tooth structure, bonded <b>amalgam</b> restorations were introduced. Various resin-based adhesives have been tried earlier under bonded <b>amalgam</b> restorations. Still there are controversies regarding the outcome of bonded <b>amalgam</b> restorations regarding their adaptability to the tooth structure and microleakage. Therefore, this study was undertaken to compare the microleakage of bonded <b>amalgam</b> restorations using different adhesive materials. Materials and Methods: Standard Class I cavities were prepared on occlusal surfaces of 60 human molars. Teeth (n= 60) were divided into three groups according to the material employed, as follows: group I: <b>amalgam</b> with glass ionomer cement (GIC) (type I); group II: <b>amalgam</b> with resin cement (Panavia F 2. 0) and group III: <b>amalgam</b> with Copalex varnish as a control. Following restoration, the teeth were submitted to thermal cycling. The teeth were subsequently immersed in 2 % rhodamine B dye under vacuum for 48 hours and sectioned to allow the assessment of microleakage under stereomicroscope. Results: The values were tabulated {{and the results were}} statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey′s post hoc test and Kruskal-Wallis test. <b>Amalgam</b> with type I GIC showed the least leakage with no statistically significant difference (P value 0. 226) when compared to <b>amalgam</b> with Panavia F 2. 0 and <b>amalgam</b> with varnish (P value 0. 107). Conclusion: It can be concluded that bonded <b>amalgam</b> with type I GIC is a good alternative to <b>amalgam</b> with resin cement (Panavia F 2. 0) and <b>amalgam</b> with varnish for large restorations, with the added advantages of GICs. Clinical Significance: Bonded <b>amalgam</b> restorations prevent over-preparation and reduce the tooth flexure. GIC type I under <b>amalgam</b> provides chemical bonding in between <b>amalgam</b> and tooth structure and thus reduces the microleakage...|$|R
40|$|Background : The intense {{development}} of adhesive restorative materials and parents′ preferences for esthetic restorations prompt clinicians to use alternative restorative materials for primary molars. <b>Amalgam,</b> however, {{is the choice}} of material {{when it comes to}} occlusal stress bearing areas, either in primary or permanent molars. To overcome the drawbacks of <b>amalgam</b> and restorative adhesive materials, the bonded <b>amalgam</b> technique is employed. Aims: To evaluate microleakage and fracture resistance of bonded <b>amalgam</b> in primary molars, and compare it with the microleakage and fracture resistance of high-copper <b>amalgam</b> and composite resin materials. Settings and Design: An in vitro study and 60 caries - free primary molars were used. Subjects and Methods: A total of 60 samples were randomly divided into two equal groups for the evaluation of microleakage and fracture resistance. Class V cavities for microleakage study prepared on 30 samples and Class II mesio-occluso-distal cavities for fracture resistance study on other 30 samples were prepared and randomly divided into three equal groups. Group I received <b>amalgam,</b> Group II received bonded <b>amalgam,</b> and Group III received composite resins. The microleakage was viewed under a stereomicroscope. The fracture resistance was evaluated using a universal testing machine. Results: Bonded <b>amalgam</b> exhibited minimum microleakage, when compared to <b>amalgam</b> and composite resin and was found to be statistically insignificant (P = 0. 203), while <b>amalgam</b> showed better fracture resistance compared to bonded <b>amalgam</b> and composite resin. It was found to be statistically insignificant (P = 0. 144). Conclusions: Bonded <b>amalgam</b> appears to be comparable to <b>amalgam</b> when microleakage is considered and to composite resin when fracture resistance is considered; hence, bonded <b>amalgam</b> can also be an alternative material to <b>amalgam</b> in primary molars...|$|R

25|$|Reductive desulfonylation {{reactions}} lead to {{the replacement}} of a carbon-sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Because the sulfonyl group is by definition attached to two carbons, however, reduction to two sets of products is possible. Mechanistic studies of reductions employing metal <b>amalgams</b> as the reducing agent suggest that upon electron transfer to the sulfone, fragmentation to a sulfinate anion and the more stable organic radical occurs. Immediate reduction of the radical and protonation then occur to afford the sulfur-free product derived from the more stable radical. Thus, S-alkyl bonds are cleaved in preference to S-aryl or S-alkenyl bonds.|$|E
