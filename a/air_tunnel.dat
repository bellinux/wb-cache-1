50|$|The second Stella car, {{built in}} 2015, {{improved}} on its predecessor {{in a few}} respects. Frontal surface area was reduced by a catamaran style <b>air</b> <b>tunnel</b> indented {{in the bottom of}} the car, along its centerline. Further, Stella Lux has a longer wheelbase and four conventionally opening doors instead of the rudimentary gull-wing doors of the first car. Aside from being more aerodynamic, the new car was also considered somewhat better-looking.|$|E

The headlights and tail lights are now two bulbs instead of a longer straightened variant, the rear wing shape is smaller and is placed in a different position, and the top <b>air</b> <b>tunnel</b> is shaped differently. The design is also slightly smaller than the race car, being 2 mm smaller in wheelbase, and 20 mm smaller in length. Other than those changes, the design is still adapted from the R1 racer.|$|E

The survey results showed that human exposure to compressed air works with the use of EPBM was minimal and no decompression illness was reported. However, there was still a total of 28 cases of barotrauma that were reported which were mainly from the tunnels dug using the open face compressed <b>air</b> <b>tunnelling</b> method.

[...] The McVickers, Rialto and four other theaters owned by the same company used tunnel <b>air.</b> <b>Tunnel</b> air was also utilized in the winter, as heating this air required less energy than heating the often much colder outside air.

50|$|A Velocity air meter {{measures}} {{the force of}} air rushing into an engine against a spring-loaded door in an <b>air</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A linear potentiometer rotated along with the hinge of the air door {{measures the}} angle of the opening and sends an electrical signal to the engine control unit (ECU) that changes as the door opens more or less. The ECU can deduce airflow into the engine based on this value after making certain corrections. The problem is that the force against the door is a function of two variables - weight of the air and speed of the air - and the ECU cannot distinguish, for a given door angle, whether the air is less dense but traveling faster or whether the air is denser but traveling more slowly. Therefore air velociy must be corrected for air density (temperature and barometric pressure) in order to reflect air mass (actual number of air molecules entering the engine per unit of time).|$|E
50|$|Formal {{research}} indicates that earth-air heat exchangers reduce building ventilation air pollution. Rabindra (2004) states, “The tunnel heat exchanger is found not to support the growth of bacteria and fungi; rather it is found to reduce the quantity of bacteria and fungi thus making the air safer for humans to inhale. It is therefore clear {{that the use of}} EAT <b>Air</b> <b>Tunnel</b> not only helps save the energy but also helps reduce the air pollution by reducing bacteria and fungi.” Likewise, Flueckiger (1999) in a study of twelve earth-air heat exchangers varying in design, pipe material, size and age, stated, “This study was performed because of concerns of potential microbial growth in the buried pipes of ground-coupled air systems. The results however demonstrate, that no harmful growth occurs and that the airborne concentrations of viable spores and bacteria, with few exceptions, even decreases after passage through the pipe-system”, and further stated, “Based on these investigations the operation of ground-coupled earth-to-air heat exchangers is acceptable as long as regular controls are undertaken and if appropriate cleaning facilities are available”.|$|E

50|$|Wing-shape {{optimization}} is {{by nature}} an iterative process. First, a baseline wing design is chosen {{to begin the}} process with; this is usually the wing created by aerospace engineers. This wing is assumed to be reasonably close to a best-fit design from the engineers. The next step is to model the wing shape and structure. Once those are mapped out, the software flies the model in a simulated <b>air</b> <b>tunnel</b> using well-developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) equations. The results of the test give the various performance characteristics of that design. Once that completes, the software makes incremental changes to the structure and shape details, recreates the model, and flies the new model through a wind tunnel. If the changes result in a better performing wing, then the software commits the changes. If not, the changes are thrown out and different changes are made. The changes are then saved as the new working model and the cycle will loop. This entire process is run until the changes observed appear to converge on a design - such as when the changes are under 1 mm.|$|E

[...] The university puts its theory to practice by building an energy efficient campus showcasing the concept of modern green buildings. Besides an innovative, energy saving architectural design, the building is equipped with a number of other cutting edge technologies that help reduce the energy consumption by 60% and potable water use by 25%. The campus is equipped with three types of cooling systems: the Earth <b>Air</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (EAT), Variable Refrigerant Volume System (VRV) and Thermal Mass Storage (TMS). The EAT used in the hostel block uses the heat sink property of the earth to maintain comfortable temperatures inside the building, saving up to 50% energy as compared to the conventional system.|$|E

Using standard turbulent modelling assumptions, flow profiles are obtained in both open tunnels and in the annulus between a tunnel wall and a moving train, from which the heat transfer coefficient between the <b>air</b> and <b>tunnel</b> wall is computed.

50|$|Renata Limited, a {{prominent}} pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh, tried out {{a pilot project}} {{trying to find out}} whether they could use the Earth <b>Air</b> <b>Tunnel</b> technology to complement the conventional air conditioning system. Concrete pipes with a total length 60 feet (~18¼m), inner diameter 9 inches, (~23 cm) outer diameter 11 inches (~28cm) were placed at a depth of 9 feet (~2¾m) underground and a blower of 1.5 kW rated power was employed. The underground temperature at that depth was found to be around 28 °C. The mean velocity of air in the tunnel was about 5 m/s. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the underground heat exchanger thus designed was poor ranging from 1.5-3. The results convinced the authorities that in hot and humid climates, it is unwise to implement the concept of Earth-Air heat exchanger. The cooling medium (earth itself) being at a temperature approaching that of the ambient environment happens to be the root cause of the failure of such principles in hot, humid areas (parts of Southeast Asia, Florida in the U.S. etc.). However, investigators from places like Britain and Turkey have reported very encouraging COPs-well above 20. The underground temperature seems to be of prime importance when planning an Earth-Air heat exchanger.|$|E

40|$|Freezing {{of poultry}} cuts in {{continuous}} convective <b>air</b> blast <b>tunnels</b> is normally {{performed with the}} products protected by Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) as a primary packaging and using Corrugated Cardboard Boxes (CCB) as secondary packaging. The objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of these secondary packaging on the freezing of poultry cuts in continuous convective <b>air</b> blast <b>tunnels.</b> The study was performed by replacing CCB with Perforated Metal Boxes (PMB) in order to remove the packaging thermal resistance. The assays, performed in a industrial plant, demonstrated that CCB used commercially for meat freezing have a high heat transfer resistance. Their replacement with PMB can lead to shorter freezing times and spatially homogeneous freezing. Reductions of up to 45 % in the freezing times were observed using PMB. The plateau of the temperature curve, related to the freezing time of free water, was significantly reduced using PMB, which is accepted to lead to better product quality after thawing. As the products were protected by the LDPE films as primary packaging, their appearance were not affected. The results presented in this work indicate that replacing CBB with PMB can be an excellent alternative to reduce freezing time and improve freezing homogeneity in industrial <b>air</b> blast <b>tunnels,</b> which could also be applied to other products...|$|R
