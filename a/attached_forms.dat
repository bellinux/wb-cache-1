50|$|Miliolana is a {{subclass}} {{established by}} Saidova, 1981 that comprises porcelaneous {{members of the}} Miliolata from the Cornuspirida, Miliolida with agglutinated forms removed to the Miliamminana, and Soritida. Included are both free and <b>attached</b> <b>forms,</b> some coiled with two chambers per whorl arranged in different planes, others that are irregular or have serial chambers, and still others are fusiform with complex interiors, superficially resembling the Fusulinacea. The unifying character is their imperforate porcelaneous tests.|$|E

The growth behaviors analysis presented the same results due to all the tested bacteria had higher maximum growth rate and saturation constant in suspended <b>form</b> than <b>attached</b> <b>form,</b> indicating the dominant growth mode would be shifted from <b>attached</b> <b>form</b> to suspended form with substrate concentration increase.

40|$|Faecal {{bacteria}} {{exist in}} both free-living and <b>attached</b> <b>forms</b> in estuarine waters. The deposition of sediments can take faecal bacteria {{out of the}} water column and to the bed. The sediments can subsequently be re-suspended to the water column, which can then lead to re-suspension of the faecal bacteria of the <b>attached</b> <b>forms</b> back to the water column. Therefore, the fate and transport of faecal bacteria is highly related to the governing sediment transport processes, particularly where these processes are significant, such as the Sev-ern Estuary, UK. However, little attempt has been made to model such processes in terms of predicting the impact of the sediment fluxes on faecal bacteria levels. Details are given of the refinement of a numerical model of faecal bacteria transport, where the sediment transport processes are significant. After testing the sediment-bacteria interaction model favourably against known results in previous study, the model was ap-plied to the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel, UK, to investigate the impact of suspended sediment fluxes on the corresponding faecal bacteria transport processes. The model predictions have proved to be encour-aging, with the results being compared to a traditional faecal bacteria modelling approach, where sediment bacteria interactions were not included. The new model provides improved predictions of faecal bacteria concentrations when sediment transport is included and for the Bristol Channel Severn Estuary it can be see...|$|E

40|$|Ephrin A 1 (EFNA 1) is {{a member}} of the A-type ephrin family of cell surface {{proteins}} that function as ligands for the A-type Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family. In malignancy, the precise role of EFNA 1 and its preferred receptor, EPHA 2, is controversial. Several studies have found that EFNA 1 may suppress EPHA 2 -mediated oncogenesis, or enhance it, depending on cell type and context. However, little is known about the conditions that influence whether EFNA 1 promotes or suppresses tumorigenicity. EFNA 1 exists in a soluble form as well as a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane attached form. We investigated whether the contradictory roles of EFNA 1 in malignancy might in part be related to the existence of both soluble and membrane <b>attached</b> <b>forms</b> of EFNA 1 and potential differences in the manner in which they interact with EPHA 2...|$|E

40|$|Periphyton {{sampling}} protocol The Central Plains Center for Bioassessment (CPCB) developed two quantitative periphyton samplers and associated protocols based on Barbour (1999), Gale (1975) and Bahls (1993) and employed {{them during the}} 2000 sampling season. Preliminary success indicate that these samplers and protocols provide a quick, easy and cost-effective method for sampling periphyton streams of the Central Plains region. The approach allows investigators to use a standard quantitative sampling method for periphyton when sampling streams with various substrates that differ between and within streams.

40|$|In {{low-energy}} salt-marsh environments, Fucus spp. frequently exhibit an atypical morphology that {{is characterized}} by the absence of an anchoring holdfast and a trend towards reduced size and buoyancy, enhanced vegetative proliferation, and often the loss of sexual reproduction. Such forms, often referred to as ecads, presumably derive from typical <b>attached</b> <b>forms,</b> but their affinities are normally difficult to establish with confidence due to their simplified and largely convergent morphology. Minute salt-marsh forms growing partially embedded in the sediment occur on Atlantic and Pacific coasts and have traditionally been recognized as an independent entity, Fucus cottonii. In this study we analyse with four microsatellite loci two F. cottonii populations from salt-marshes of Oregon (NE Pacific) and Ireland (Europe, near the species type locality), as well as local populations of other Fucus spp. that could be considered potential source populations, either directly or via hybridization. Our results show that the F. cottonii from Oregon derive from F. gardneri whereas the Irish population is closer to F. spiralis. We conclude that F. cottonii is not a coherent genetic entity, but an artificial grouping of evolutionarily independent populations that converged into similar morphologies in different salt-marsh habitats...|$|E

40|$|Ballast {{water is}} a major {{transport}} vector of exotic aquatic species and pathogenic microorganisms. The wide-ranging spread of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O 1 from harbor areas has been frequently ascribed to discharge of contaminated ballast water into eutrophic coastal environments, such as during {{the onset of the}} seventh cholera pandemic in South America in the early 1990 s. To determine the microbiological hazards of ballast waters transported to Brazilian ports, we evaluated water and plankton samples taken from (i) ballast water tanks of recently arrived ships, (ii) port areas along the Brazilian coastline from ~ 1 to 32 oS and (iii) three coastal areas in S&# 227;o Paulo State. Vibrio concentration and toxigenic V. cholerae O 1 occurrence were analyzed. Plankton-associated vibrios were more abundant than free-living vibrios in all studied environments. Vibrio cholerae was found in 9. 5 % of ballast tanks and 24. 2 % of port samples, both as free-living and <b>attached</b> <b>forms,</b> and was absent off S&# 227;o Paulo State. Toxigenic V. cholerae O 1 isolates (ctxA+, tcpA+), involved in cholera disease, were found in ballast water (2 %) and harbor (2 %) samples.

40|$|The scleractinian Manicina areolata is {{a common}} coral on Caribbean hard and soft substrata and was studied at Lee Stocking Island (Exuma Cays, Bahamas). It is not only found on reefs but also on bioclastic sand with seagrasses. Investigated corolla ranged in size from 2 to 10 cm, growth form varied from conical with round to oval {{cross-section}} to turbinate forms with few meanders and flat oval cross-section. The conical morphotype was usually attached to hard substratum, while the turbinate morphotype was usually unattached and upright, in soft substratum. In infratidal areas, both attached and unattached turbinate forms were found in close vicinity, however, conical <b>attached</b> <b>forms</b> were rare. Habitats with sandy softgrounds, where free-living turbinate morphotypes were common, were influenced by strong tidal currents with concurrent danger of burial or “disorientation” of the corolla. Investigations in the flume channel showed that the colony shape itself led to passive cleaning and self-righting, which was achieved by the flat-turbinate morphology, with a concave side and a flat to slightly convex opposite side, under high current speeds. The concave side, and particularly the median lobes formed by many meandroid coralla, were the critical morphological factors. Grooves formed in between the lobes channeled currents {{in a way that}} scour underneath the coral and drag produced by the lobes allowed passive self-righting. This could be used to explain ecological strategies in similar-shaped fossil solitary corals...|$|E
