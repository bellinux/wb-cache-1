40|$|A multicenter {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 173 patients with active, endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers (158 men, 15 women). They were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to two groups: those receiving placebo capsules (91 patients) and those receiving capsules containing 100 microgram of 15 (R) - 15 -methyl prostaglandin E 2 (<b>arbaprostil)</b> (82 patients). Each drug was ingested {{four times a day}} (1 h before meals and at bedtime) for 28 days. Endoscopy was performed on days 0, 14, and 28 after the trial began. At each examination, the ulcer size was measured and whether the ulcer had healed was recorded. <b>Arbaprostil</b> increased the incidence of ulcer healing to approximately the same degree as reported in most extensive studies with cimetidine. At 14 days, three times as many patients were totally healed in the arbaprostil-treated as in the placebo-treated group (37 % vs. 12 %, p less than 0. 001). At 28 days, 67 % of patients receiving <b>arbaprostil</b> were healed compared with 39 % in the group receiving placebo (p less than 0. 001). Similarly, the ulcer size, measured endoscopically, was much smaller after <b>arbaprostil</b> administration than in the group receiving placebo after both 14 and 28 days (p less than 0. 001). Side effects attributable to treatment consisted primarily of loose stools and diarrhea (34 %). Smoking retarded healing in the placebo-treated group (p less than 0. 05), but did not significantly retard healing in patients treated with <b>arbaprostil.</b> We conclude that <b>arbaprostil</b> markedly accelerates the healing rate of active duodenal ulcers. This effect may be due to inhibition of acid secretion as well as gastric cytoprotection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiclinic trial {{evaluated}} <b>arbaprostil</b> [15 (R) - 15 methyl prostaglandin E 2] for {{the treatment}} of acute gastric ulcer, achieving an overall enrollment of 124 patients (of which 113 were considered evaluable). This 6 -wk trial used an <b>arbaprostil</b> dose of 10 micrograms q. i. d., which has little gastric acid antisecretory activity. Endoscopies were performed after 21 and 42 days of treatment, at which times the <b>arbaprostil</b> and placebo healing rates, respectively, were 6 / 59 (10. 2 %) and 4 / 53 (7. 6 %) on day 21 and 25 / 59 (42. 4 %) and 16 / 50 (32. 0 %) on day 42. No significant differences between the treatment groups were found for pain relief, antacid consumption, and mucosal healing. This trial documents that a 10 -micrograms dose of <b>arbaprostil</b> (which may be considered cytoprotective because of its small effect on gastric acid secretion), although safe and associated with no side effects, is not efficacious in healing acute gastric ulcer...|$|E
