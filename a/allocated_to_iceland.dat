50|$|The Filipino {{migration}} <b>to</b> <b>Iceland</b> {{from the}} past 20 years has primarily been caused by the economic boom. Iceland, being a small country with {{less than half a}} million people, needed to outsource in order to satisfy its demands in production, services, and construction. This has opened doors for many Filipinos, coming from a developing country. On the other hand, it was not always work that encouraged Filipinos <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>Iceland.</b> Filipino migration <b>to</b> <b>Iceland</b> began with a few Filipina women moving <b>to</b> <b>Iceland</b> <b>to</b> marry Icelandic men in the 1990s. This gave them an advantage of learning the local language much quicker as compared to other Filipino workers who often only work alone or with their co-foreigners. Aside from work, one key reason for migrating <b>to</b> <b>Iceland</b> is family reunification.|$|R
