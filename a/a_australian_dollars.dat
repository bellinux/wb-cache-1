40|$|The {{impact of}} an unannounced shock in freight rate, {{international}} trade and business cycle on the non-bulk freight rail demand in Australia is examined by using a VAR model and an annual data set encompassing four decades (1970 – 2011). Results based on VAR, impulse response functions and variance decompositions suggest that freight rate and the volatility of the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> are the most dominant determinants. The availability of an alternative mode, such as road, {{could be attributed to}} this considerable response to the freight rate.

50|$|Despite {{the global}} {{economic}} challenges and natural disasters in 2010-2011, Australia's tourism growth was supported by increased consumption (up 4.4% over the previous year, largely due {{to an increase in}} the number of visitors from overseas).

2500|$|The 1974–75 Ashes series {{consisted}} of six cricket Test matches, each match lasted five days with {{six hours of}} play each day and eight ball overs.

Ian Chappell's Australians won the series 4–1 and [...] "brutally and unceremoniously wrenched the Ashes" [...] from Mike Denness's England team. It was Australia's first series victory over England for ten years and the experience proved popular as 777,563 spectators came through the gates and paid nearly <b>a</b> million <b>Australian</b> <b>dollars</b> for the privilege.

40|$|The {{announcement}} in August 2011 that BlueScope Steel {{was about to}} close one of its Port Kembla blast furnaces and cease steel exports quickly spurred public debate, not just about steel but about the very future of manufacturing in Australia. With <b>an</b> elevated <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> job losses have followed in garment-making, car manufacturing and aluminium smelting. Even the iconic Australian fly-spray Mortein is now heading for offshore production. Australian Workers’ Union National Secretary Paul Howes thus suggested: ‘The question the Australian community needs to ask itself*is {{do we want to}} be a country that still makes things?

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the closure of}} the Port Kembla copper smelter and refinery, Southern Copper Limited, in 1995, after over eighty five years of unbroken operation and a change of ownership to CRA in 1981. It argues that the closure is most accurately understood as a resolution reflecting the exigencies of CRA 2 ̆ 7 s business situation at the time. The decision was taken as Southern Copper faced increasingly heavy pressures including <b>a</b> strengthening <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> demanding environmental standards and community expectations. These pressures were faced at a time when both the industrial relations climate and the manufacturing sector were undergoing significant change. The paper suggests that the strength and actions of the IJIawarra unions played little part, if any, in the decision to close the smelter, despite local mythology and CRA statement to the contrary...|$|R

40|$|Many asset pricing models {{require an}} annualised risk {{coefficient}} which {{is determined by}} the linear rescaling of the variance from other time intervals. However, this approach may not be appropriate for dependent time series. This paper investigates the scaling relationships for daily credit spreads, from January 1986 to May 1998, between AAA, AA and <b>A</b> rated <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> denominated Eurobonds with maturities of 2, 5, 7 and 10 years. We find evidence of a term structure and co-movement in credit spreads by maturity. We also find the credit spread return series were time variant, leptokurtic, autocorrelated and exhibited different degrees of negative long-term dependence. The series all displayed similar scaling properties with the estimated standard deviation, based upon a scaling at the square root of time, significantly underestimating the actual level of risk predicted from a normal distribution. These results have implications for credit spread derivatives...|$|R

40|$|In August 2011 the {{announcement}} by Bluescope Steel of mass layoffs at its Port Kembla steelworks, in the Illawarra region, sparked renewed public debate and media {{commentary on the}} future of manufacturing in Australia. The debate has since spread to cars, aluminium smelting - even Mortein fly spray - and has quickly coalesced around the unprecedented high <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> its impacts on exports, and the prospects of the production of goods shifting overseas. <b>As</b> <b>Australian</b> mining magnates such as Clive Palmer, Gina Rinehart and Twiggy Forrest attempt to remould Australia around their 2 ̆ 7 quarry vision 2 ̆ 7 (Pearse, 2009) of extractive minerals exports, <b>a</b> high value <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> puts at risk any industries where import substitution is possible: tourism, education, retail (doubly threatened by the rise of e-commerce), and the manufacturing sector. In this article we seek to provide a fresh perspective to the debate on Australian manufacturing by focusing instead on the internal dynamics of industries and regions - where a political economic analysis reveals important insights. Our case study is the Australian surfboard-making industry. By focusing on internal as well as external dynamics, we illuminate the problems with orthodox approaches to comparative advantage, and suggest critical factors beyond the high dollar {{that need to be addressed}} if this iconic form of manufacturing is to remain viable in Australia...|$|R
2500|$|According to the 2011 Credit Suisse Global Wealth report, Australia's wealth per adult had quadrupled {{over the}} past decade, and it's total wealth was US$6.4 trillion. In the report Australia was the second wealthiest {{country in the world}} behind Switzerland based on average wealth per adult, and had the highest median wealth in the world (US$222,000, nearly four times the amount of each US adult) and a {{proportion}} of people with wealth above US$100,000 that was eight times the world average. This was attributed to <b>a</b> resilient <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> property ownership levels and a strong labor market. Compared {{to the rest of the}} world, very few Australians had net worth less than US$1,000, which was attributed to relatively low credit card and student loan debt. In 2013, Australia was identified by the Credit Suisse as retaining it's 2012 position as the nation with the second-highest average wealth per adult (US$403,000), however, the nation's poverty rate was also reported to have increased from 10.2% in 2000-01 to 11.8% at the time of the 2013 report on global wealth.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates value {{co-creation}} {{within the}} context of the Australian international tertiary education service. Value co-creation is an emerging area of interest in services marketing and one that is germane to the increasingly important international service sector, tertiary education. In Australia, the international tertiary education sector is one of the country’s top exports, valued at approximately $ 18 billion. However, the Australian international tertiary education sector is facing a number of challenges, impacting its future viability and global competitiveness. Aggressive international student recruiting from competitors, <b>a</b> strong <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> poor visa practices, crime involving international students and changing student expectations, are present challenges faced by the sector. To effectively address these challenges, a rethink of the strategic approach of the Australian international tertiary education sector is required. As such, this thesis aims to provide a new perspective in marketing international education—value co-creation via community engagement—as a potential catalyst to help sustain the viability of the Australian international tertiary education sector over time.
