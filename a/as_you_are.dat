25|$|In January 2005, Chesney {{released}} the album Be <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> (Songs from an Old Blue Chair), supporting {{it with his}} Somewhere in the Sun Tour. Be <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> is composed mostly of ballads. The album {{reached the top of}} the mainstream of popular music as well as country charts. Although it qualified for platinum status, it seemed a lot less popular than his more traditional albums.|$|E
25|$|Yes, I rapped one of them. Im as {{surprised}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> But {{here is the}} {{thing you need to}} know about these songs and the ones coming next: These are all me. Love them, or hate them, but dont mistake them for anything other than an entirely personal, un-tethered-from-the-machine, free for all view of the world, refracted through my own crazy lens.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E
25|$|Hand loading or {{reloading}} {{is allowed}} in South Africa as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in possession of}} a competency certificate to possess a firearm as well as a license to possess such a firearm. Sport shooters load to make the shooting sports more affordable and hunters load to obtain greater accuracy. Powder and primers are strictly controlled by law and can not exceed for 2kg for powder and 2400 primers. The amount of ammunition you may have in your possession is also limited to 200 rounds per chambering. If you are a registered dedicated sportsman, the quantities are unlimited. Although the powder's quantity is unlimited if you are a dedicated sportsman, storage of excess amounts of powder is dangerous due to the potential of fire occurring from accidental ignition. A manual from a South African powder manufacturer Rheinmetall Denel Munition (previously Somchem) is available for reloaders with adequate information and guidelines.|$|E

25|$|French's and Smith-Dorrien's {{accounts}} differ {{about the}} conference at 5.30am on 23 August. French's account {{in his memoirs}} “1914” stated that he had become doubtful of the advance into Belgium and warned his officers {{to be ready to}} attack or retreat. This agrees largely with French's diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When “1914” was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been “in excellent form” at the meeting and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable. Edmonds in the “Official History” agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat. Edmonds – who was not an eyewitness – later claimed in his memoirs that French had instructed Smith-Dorrien to “give battle” on the line of the Conde Canal, and that when Smith-Dorrien queried whether he was to attack or defend he was simply told, after French had whispered with Murray, “Don’t ask questions, do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> told”.|$|E

Author Simon Leng writes that [...] ", and Harrison's leadership of the Beatles into Vedic philosophy, sparked the entire fashion for Indian music and a million backpackers' pilgrimages to Kashmir..." [...] Juan Mascaró, a professor in Sanskrit studies at Cambridge University, wrote to Harrison after the song's release, saying: [...] "it is a moving song, and may it move the souls of millions.

500|$|Live Forever <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> Now with Alan Resnick {{aired on}} December 24, 2013 at 4a.m. on Adult Swim. It {{was the third}} {{in a series of}} {{infomercial}} parodies broadcast by the network, succeeding Broomshakalaka and For-Profit Online University. The early-morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours. The special was published onto Adult Swim's YouTube channel the same day. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7, meaning that approximately 0.7 percent of households with a television watched it. A web chat allowing users to converse with [...] "Teddy" [...] was created for the network's website.|$|E
500|$|According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Cowart {{belonged to}} the Supreme White Alliance, a white {{supremacist}} group. A photograph of Cowart celebrating the birthday of Adolf Hitler with other members was on the group's website. On the group's social networking site, Cowart described himself as [...] "easygoing and easy to get along with, as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> white!" [...] Cowart was allegedly {{kicked out of the}} group sometime prior to his arrest. The club's president, Steve Edwards of Central City, Kentucky, resigned due to the negative press following Cowart's arrest. Although Edwards acknowledged Cowart's membership, he said the group had no part in the plan, and claimed that the media exaggerated Cowart's connection to the group.|$|E

At 08:30 a further messenger from Khalid declared that [...] "We have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us"; Cave replied that [...] "We do not want to open fire, but unless you do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> told we shall certainly do so."

500|$|... "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] {{was used}} in The Walking Dead season eight opener [...] "Mercy" [...] during an {{ambiguous}} scene featuring a grey-haired and bearded Rick Grimes. Many critics and commentators noted {{that the use of}} [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] was idiosyncratic. Yankovic later tweeted: [...] "I’m just as confused <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> why 'Another One Rides the Bus' was featured in #TheWalkingDead season premiere, but I’m extremely honored!" [...] Showrunner Scott M. Gimple later told Entertainment Weekly that he had chosen the track because it [...] "had to be a song that I wanted [...] Judith to be into". Gimble also claimed that he wanted the music to be [...] "even more jarring" [...] than Rick's appearance.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Lansbury's {{performance}} were overwhelmingly positive. In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth {{and a very}} taking [...]" [...] The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys {{it as much as}} you do. And it lasts as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Philharmonic {{presented}} a staged concert {{version of the}} musical from February 28 to March 2, 2013, at Avery Fisher Hall. Kelli O'Hara played Julie, with Nathan Gunn as Billy, Stephanie Blythe as Nettie, Jessie Mueller as Carrie, Jason Danieley as Enoch, Shuler Hensley as Jigger, John Cullum as the Starkeeper, and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin. Tiler Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle. The production was directed by John Rando. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote, [...] "this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ever likely to hear." [...] It was broadcast {{as part of the}} PBS Live from Lincoln Center series, premiering on April 26, 2013.|$|E

500|$|Boley Hill to {{the south}} of the castle may have been used as John's {{headquarters}} during the siege. According to the Barnwell chronicler, five siege engines hurled a barrage of stones at the castle's wall day and night. These were supported by missiles from smaller bows and crossbows. Though the Barnwell chronicler claimed they smashed a hole in the castle's outer walls, Roger of Wendover asserted they were ineffective and that John turned to other methods to breach the defences. A letter dated 14October indicates John was preparing to undermine the castle's walls. He wrote to Canterbury, asking for the production [...] "by day and night of as many picks <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> able" [...] and that they be sent to Rochester. On 26October a relief force of 700horse was sent from London. They turned back before arriving, perhaps because they heard the king was advancing to meet them.|$|E
500|$|Say Anything {{released}} the video for [...] "Shiksa (Girlfriend)" [...] on April 9, 2008. On April 25, Say Anything performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. During summer 2008, Say Anything joined the Warped Tour {{for the first}} time, appearing on all dates. On August 1, 2008, Say Anything announced the Max Bemis Song Shop, through which users could pay for Max Bemis to write a song based on a short writing by the customer. However, {{by the end of}} the night, the item was no longer available with the following text displayed on the item listing: [...] "We're sorry but Max can't write songs as fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> requesting them. As soon as he catches up we will start again. Thank you so much for believing in our crazy idea." [...] The Song Shop has reopened semi-annually since its initial launch, and taken down after about a week each time. This aforementioned message has been displayed each time the Song Shop was discontinued.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E
