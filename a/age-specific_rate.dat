Study Design and Setting: Corrected <b>age-specific</b> <b>rate</b> for a certain cancer in age group 65 + was calculated from the <b>age-specific</b> <b>rate</b> of that cancer in age group 55 - 64 multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from reference cancer registry (sex- and age-specific coefficients from Finnish Cancer Registry, a nation-wide registry with high validity of data). All cancer data were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2002. Results: The crude rate (and number of new cases) for “All sites excluding skin ” was 13. 6 % (men 18. 7 %; women 8. 1 %) under-estimated. The under-enumeration was 18. 9 % for the age-standardized rate (men 25. 4 %; women 11. 8 %). This means there were 58, 000 new cancer cases (about 7, 000 more than original) in 2002.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to describe the trends of hip fracture in Hong Kong over the last decade, and to compare the incidence in Hong Kong with that from the Wessex Health Region of the UK in 1995. METHODS: The number of hip fractures was calculated using hospital discharge records for all public hospitals in Hong Kong in 1991 and 1995. <b>Age-specific</b> incidence <b>rates</b> were then calculated using the mid-year census population for the two years. These rates were presented with previously reported <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> for Hong Kong in 1966 and 1985. These <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> for Hong Kong in 1995 were compared with rates for the Wessex Health Region of the UK. The total number of hip fracture expected in 2010 was calculated by applying the <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of 1995 to the projected population for 2010. RESULTS: In 1995, a total of 1138 men and 2782 women in Hong Kong fractured their hip. The <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> had remained static from 1985 to 1995, after substantial rise from 1966 to 1985. In 1995, the rates of hip fracture rates were 11 / 1000 in women and 5 / 1000 in men who were 70 years and older. These rates were almost identical to those observed in the Wessex Health Region of the UK. CONCLUSION: The <b>age-specific</b> incidence <b>rates</b> of hip fracture had not risen in Hong Kong in the last decade. The incidence of hip fracture in Hong Kong was similar to that in the UK in 1995.

HP 2010 has two primary goals: 1. to improve quality and years of healthy life; and 2. to eliminate health disparities. 1 Within these broad goals are 28 disease/condition-specific objectives based on best-available, evidence-based knowledge and surveillance. 1 For respiratory diseases, HP 2010 specifies eight asthma-spe-cific objectives. Specifically, Objective 24 - 2 sets the following target rates for asthma hospitalization: (1) an <b>age-specific</b> <b>rate</b> of 25 per 10, 000 children ages 0 - 4 years (2) an age-standardized* rate of 7. 7 per 10, 000 children and adults ages 5 - 64 years, and (3) an age-standardized rate of 11 per 10, 000 adults ages 65 +. Similarly, there are well-defined targets for the reduction of hospital emergency department (ED) visits for asthma: from an <b>age-specific</b> <b>rate</b> of 150. 0 per 10, 000 in 1998 to 80 per 10, 000 among children aged 0 - 4 in 2010; from an age-stan-dardized rate of 71. 1 per 10, 000 in 1998 to 50 per 10, 000 for children and adults 5 - 64 in 2010; and from an age-stan-dardized rate of 29. 5 per 10, 000 in 1998 to 15 per 10, 000 among adults ages 65 + in 2010. Health departments charged with monitoring the burden of asthma in their state must track asthma-related hospitalization and ED visits.

However, the impact of such interaction on the statistical distribution of age-at-onset of outcome (disease or death) is infrequently assessed. We therefore explored the impact of such interaction on {{the shape of the}} onset-age distribution. Study Design and SettingWe use for illustration age-at-onset of radiation-related early menopause in a cohort of female Japanese Atomic Bomb Survivors. The statistical distribution of age-at-onset was derived from a parametric hazard rate model fit to the data, assuming an underlying Gaussian onset-age distribution among nonexposed women. ResultsCommonly used forms of exposure-by-age (attained age) interaction led to unnatural estimates of the <b>age-specific</b> <b>rate</b> function and unreasonable estimates of the onset-age distribution among exposed women, including positive risk of menopause before menarche.

To determine these, a different number of knots and different degrees are used and the results are compared to establish this sensitivity.

In order to provide some context for the forecasts we begin by describing long-term trends in the remand and sentenced prisoner numbers and some of the factors that have influenced growth in these populations. Results: The short-term forecast is that, if relevant influences remain unchanged, NSW will have 12, 191 prisoners by March 2017. If <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of imprisonment remain constant, we expect the NSW prison population to rise to 12, 500 by June 2036.

The CDC recommendation for applying these methods to Ohio was to apply the <b>age‐specific</b> <b>rate</b> estimates from the national study to the Ohio population. The national methodology provides estimated rates for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for each of the age ranges 0 ‐ 17, 18 ‐ 64, and 65 +. The CDC methodology generated a range of 3 rates for each estimate based on the distribution of rates observed in their surveillance data. These rates are referred to as the midrange, low, and high rates...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{forecasts}} of <b>age-specific</b> fertility <b>rates</b> {{are critical for}} government policy, planning and decision making. With the availability of Human Fertility Database (2011), we compare the empirical accuracy of the point and interval forecasts, obtained by the approach of Hyndman and Ullah (2007) and its variants for forecasting <b>age-specific</b> fertility <b>rates.</b> The analyses are carried out using the age-specific fertility data of 15 mostly developed countries. Based on the one-step-ahead to 20 -step-ahead forecast error measures, the weighted Hyndman-Ullah method provides the most accurate point and interval forecasts for forecasting <b>age-specific</b> fertility <b>rates,</b> among all the methods we investigated...|$|R
40|$|This chapter will extract {{information}} on kinship {{numbers from the}} <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> of birth and death of a population. A fixed set of <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> implies {{the probability that a}} girl aged a has a living mother and great-grandmother, as well as her expected number of daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, and cousins. Certain assumptions are required to draw the implications, some stronger than others. The formulas of this chapter in effect set up a genealogical table, giving not the names of incumbents in the several positions but the expected number of incumbents. Those of Fig. 10. 1 are based on birth and death rates of the United States in 1965, whose net reproduction rate R 0 was 1. 395 and e 0 o was 73. 829, all for females. They offer a different kind of knowledge from what would be provided by a kinship census...|$|R
40|$|In Japan, {{the number}} of suicide deaths per year has {{exceeded}} 30, 000 after the bubble burst beginning in the 1990 s. We explored suicide features, including the temporal and regional variations, {{in the period of}} economic transition, 1975 - 2005. The influences of social factors on the <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> were also investigated to explain the features. Average <b>age-specific</b> <b>rates</b> with 10 -year spans in each 5 -year period and three social indicators in 47 prefectures were obtained from national data. Significant temporal and regional changes were observed in all <b>age-specific</b> suicide <b>rates</b> for men and women. Prefectural income per person was negatively correlated with the suicide rates for men aged 15 - 74 and for women aged 55 - 64, and outpatients in mental hospitals per day had positive correlations with the suicide rates for men aged 25 and over. Moreover, there were negative correlations between the proportion of persons employed in the tertiary industry and suicide rates for men aged 75 and over and for women aged 55 and over. In conclusion, all <b>age-specific</b> suicide <b>rates</b> for Japanese men and women changed drastically in the period of 1975 - 2005, but they showed regional clustering in 47 prefectures. A combination of social factors could explain the suicide rates for young and middle-aged men and for elderly people. Therefore, suicide prevention measures for different age-specific populations at risk in individual prefectures should be carefully taken...|$|R
