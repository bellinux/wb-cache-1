40|$|Abstract — Permanent magnet motors are {{commonly}} used in AC inverter controlled <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> <b>systems</b> for home appliances. Acoustic noise and vibration reduction in the outdoor unit compressor is an important task, in addition to attaining high efficiency power usage. It is also required to eliminate motor position sensors such as Hall Effect sensors due to the structural constraint of sealed compressors. These requirements naturally lead manufacturers to incorporate sinusoidal sensor-less PM motor control. Today, most <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> units are based on 32 bit RISC microcontrollers to achieve compressor motor control. In outdoor unit <b>air</b> <b>conditioners,</b> {{not only does the}} compressor use an AC inverter but also the fan uses an AC inverter. The fan is also based on a PM motor and its control is based on Hall Effect sensors in today's system. Power factor control is also required for a certain power range of <b>air</b> <b>conditioner,</b> which has normally been implemented by separate analog PFC control IC. This paper discusses a hardware computation-based dedicated controller for <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> applications that enables sinusoidal sensor-less PM motor control for both compressor and fan, and digital PFC within a single monolithic silicon platform. Sensorless Field Oriented Control (FOC) is implemented using an embedded Motion Control Engine (MCE) so that computation power can be attained with two motor FOC controls and digital PFC combined.

The purpose of these programs was to improve the efficiency of the stock of air conditioning equipment and provide better demand-side management. This paper examines the effect of refrigerant charging (proper servicing of the equipment), system sizing, and efficiency on the steady-state, coincident peak utility demand of a residential central air conditioning system. The study is {{based on the results of}} laboratory tests of a three-ton, capillary tube expansion, split-system <b>air</b> <b>conditioner,</b> <b>system</b> capacity and efficiency data available from manufacturer's literature, and assumptions about relative sizing of the equipment to cooling load on a residence. A qualitative discussion is provided concerning the possible impacts of transient operation and total energy use on utility program decisions. The analysis indicates that proper sizing of the unit is the largest factor affecting energy demand of the three factors (sizing, charging, and efficiency) studied in this paper. For typical oversizing of units to cooling loads in houses, both overcharging and undercharging showed significant negative impact on peak demand. The impacts of SEER changes in utility peak demand were found to be virtually independent of oversizing.

This report describes the latest version of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center (ACRC) room <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> simulation model. The model is being continually improved using heat transfer and pressure drop correlations and other modifications which are added {{as a result of an}} ongoing experimental program. The governing equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method, which allows the equations to be listed in an order-independent fashion. A specialized Newton-Raphson equation solving package was developed that allows model variables and parameters in the governing equations to be easily "swapped" for design purposes and includes automated uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. A two-stage approach toward room <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> instrumentation is an integral part of the plans for model validation and improvement. The first stage uses only air-side thermocouples, and the second stage introduces refrigerant-side thermocouples and pressure transducers. Comparison of data sets from the two stages allows the intrusive effects of the refrigerant-side instrumentation to be identified. Simultaneous measurements with air and refrigerant-side thermocouples make it possible to quantify the offset errors in surface thermocouple measurements of refrigerant temperatures. The first stage of the room <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> instrumentation has been completed, and a baseline data set has been taken.
