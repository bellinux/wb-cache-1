40|$|Simulators {{have been}} {{developed}} to dramatically improve the fidelity of play for field monitors and aircraft participating in radiological disaster drills and exercises. Simulated radiological measurements for the current Global Positioning System (GPS) location are derived from realistic models of radiological consequences for accidents and malicious acts. The <b>aerial</b> version <b>outputs</b> analog pulses corresponding to the signal that would be produced by various NaI (Tl) detectors at that location. The field monitor version reports the reading for any make/model of survey instrument selected. Position simulation modes are included in the aerial and field versions. The aerial version can generate a flight path based on input parameters or import an externally generated sequence of latitude and longitude coordinates. The field version utilizes a map-based point and click/drag interface to generate individual or a sequence of evenly spaced instrument measurements...|$|R

40|$|The coordinated {{motion control}} of {{multiple}} vehicles {{has emerged as}} a field of major interest in the control community. This thesis addresses two topics related to the control of a group of <b>aerial</b> vehicles: the <b>output</b> feedback attitude synchronization of rigid bodies and the formation control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) capable of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL). The information flow between members of the team is assumed fixed and undirected. The first part of this thesis is devoted to the attitude synchronization of a group of spacecraft. In this context, we propose control schemes for the synchronization of a group of spacecraft to a predefined attitude trajectory without angular velocity measurements. We also propose some velocity-free consensus-seeking schemes allowing a group of spacecraft to align their attitudes, without reference trajectory specification. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the control of a group of VTOL-UAVs in the Special Euclidian group SE(3), i. e., position and orientation. In this context, we propose a few position coordination schemes without linear-velocity measurements. We also propose some solutions to the same problem in the presence of communication time-delays between aircraft. To solve the above mentioned problems, several new technical tools have been introduced in this thesis to overcome the deficiencies of the existing techniques in this field...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{output and}} its {{distribution}} to specific tissues has been^measured in the intertidal abalone, Haliotis cracherodii (Mollusca,^Gastropoda). Thermodilution, {{a modification of}} the classical^indicator-dilution method, {{was used to measure}} cardiac output in^unanesthetized, unrestrained abalone under conditions of both^submergence and aerial exposure. Because of the nature of this^technique, the measurement could be completed within about 30 ^to 45 sec so that short term changes in cardiac output could be^monitored. Pulsatile aortic blood pressure was measured^simultaneously and allowed for the calculation of stroke volume. Insubmerged abalone a logarithmic relationship was found to existbetween cardiac output (Q) and body weight (W(,b)) : Q(2 ̆ 7) =(2 ̆ 7) 1. 99 (W(,b)) (2 ̆ 70. 50). Stroke volumes ranged from 1. 03 to 1. 85 ml with larger animals possessing larger stroke volumes;During <b>aerial</b> exposure, cardiac <b>output</b> declined immediately; stroke volume decreased by a nearly proportional amount while heart rate decreased only moderately. At the same time, mean arterial pressure usually increased. This suggested the possibility of blood re-distribution during aerial exposure;Microsphere studies in submerged animals showed that blood flow to selected tissues correlated very closely with reported values for oxygen uptake of the isolated tissues. During aerial exposure, blood flow decreased to many of the tissues examined. Blood flow increased 2 to 3 x to the mantle tissue. This suggests the possibility that the mantle may become important as an accessory gas exchange organ during aerial exposure...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the U. S. Department of Defense {{placed the}} {{technological}} development of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tools {{at the top}} of its priority list. Area surveillance that takes place in an urban setting is an ISR tool of special interest. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are ideal candidates to perform area surveillance because they are inexpensive and they do not require a human pilot to be aboard. Multiple unmanned systems increase the rate of information flow from the target region and maintain up to date information. The purpose of the research described in this dissertation is to develop and test a system that coordinates multiple UAVs on a wide area coverage surveillance mission. The research presented in this document implements a waypoint generator for multiple aerial vehicles that is especially suited for large area surveillance. The system chooses initial locations for the vehicles and generates a set of balanced sub-trees which cover the region of interest (ROI) for the vehicles. The sub-trees are then optimally combined to form a single minimal tree that spans the entire region. The system transforms the tree path into a series of waypoints suitable for the <b>aerial</b> vehicles. The <b>output</b> of the system is a set of waypoints for each vehicle assigned to the coverage task. Results from computer simulation and flight testing are presented. Ph. D.

40|$|Coal heaps are {{frequently}} self-burning by definite environmental conditions, therefore thermal activity monitoring of these localities is important. For this purpose, data from terrestrial measurement or thermal infrared images are used. Subsurface coal fires monitored by terrestrial measurement by contact thermometers are time-consuming and dangerous because of landslides. That {{is a reason}} why coal fires are mostly monitored by thermal infrared images through remote sensing, i. e. satellite-borne or airborne data, {{which is much more}} suitable for thermal activity monitoring. The satellite data do not have sufficient geometric resolution (60 - 120 m per pixel), aerial thermal data are accurate, but expensive. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or better RPAS - remotely piloted aircraft systems) can be solution – thermal images obtained by RPAS have good geometric resolution and can be used for small areas only and our case project areas are not so big. From economic point of view, low cost technology is preferred. The article describes opportunities of low-cost thermal infrared data, the use of RPAS (mapping by Microkopter system) in thermal monitoring and photogrammetric tasks (coal heaps) such as low cost aerial thermal mapping. The problems of planning and data acquisition are illustrated by creating an orthophoto. Theoretical preparation of data acquisition deals with RPAS Microkopter mission planning and operation. The obtained data are processed by several sets of software specially developed for close range <b>aerial</b> photogrammetry. The <b>outputs</b> are orthophoto images, digital elevation models and thermal map. As a bonus, low-cost aerial methods with small thermal camera are shown...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to confirm the {{possibility}} of making largescale orthophotomaps applying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Trimble- UX 5. A planned altitude reference of the studying territory was carried out before to the aerial surveying. The studying territory has been marked with distinctive checkpoints {{in the form of}} triangles (0. 5 × 0. 5 × 0. 2 m). The checkpoints used to precise the accuracy of orthophotomap have been marked with similar triangles. To determine marked reference point coordinates and check-points method of GNSS in real-time kinematics (RTK) measuring has been applied. Projecting of aerial surveying has been done with the help of installed Trimble Access Aerial Imaging, having been used to run out the UX 5. Aerial survey out of the Trimble UX 5 UAV has been done {{with the help of the}} digital camera SONY NEX- 5 R from 200 m and 300 m altitude. These aerial surveying data have been calculated applying special photogrammetric software Pix 4 D. The orthophotomap of the surveying objects has been made with its help. To determine the precise accuracy of the got results of aerial surveying the checkpoint coordinates according to the orthophotomap have been set. The average square error has been calculated according to the set coordinates applying GNSS measurements. A-priori accuracy estimation of spatial coordinates of the studying territory using the aerial surveying data have been calculated: mx= 0. 11 m, my= 0. 15 m, mz= 0. 23 m in the village of Remeniv and mx= 0. 26 m, my= 0. 38 m, mz= 0. 43 m in the town of Vynnyky. The accuracy of determining checkpoint coordinates has been investigated using images obtained out of UAV and the average square error of the reference points. Based on comparative analysis of the got results of the accuracy estimation of the made orthophotomap it can be concluded that the value the average square error does not exceed a-priori accuracy estimation. The possibility of applying Trimble UX 5 UAV for making large-scale orthophotomaps has been investigated. The <b>aerial</b> surveying <b>output</b> data using UAV can be applied for monitoring potentially dangerous for people objects, the state border controlling, checking out the plots of settlements. Thus, it is important to control the accuracy the got results. Having based on the done analysis and experimental researches it can be concluded that applying UAV gives the possibility to find data more efficiently in comparison with the land surveying methods. As the result, the Trimble UX 5 UAV gives the possibility to survey built-up territories with the required accuracy for making orthophotomaps with the following scales 1 : 2000, 1 : 1000, 1 : 500...|$|R
40|$|Continuous cereal-based {{cropping}} {{has led to}} a rapid {{decline in}} soil fertility in the Guinea savanna agro-ecological zone of northern Ghana with corresponding low crop yields. We evaluated the effects of cropping system and soil fertility status on grain yields and N 2 -fixation by grain legumes and net N contribution to soil fertility improvement in contrasting sites in this agro-ecological zone. Maize was intercropped with cowpea, soybean and groundnut within a row, with a maize stand alternated with two equally spaced cowpea or groundnut stands and in the maize-soybean system, four equally spaced soybean stands. These intercrops were compared with sole crops of maize, cowpea, soybean and groundnut in fertile and poorly fertile fields at sites in the southern (SGS) and the northern (NGS) Guinea savanna. The proportion of N derived from N 2 -fixation (%Ndfa) was comparable between intercrops and sole crops. However, the amount of N 2 -fixed was significantly larger in sole crops due to a greater biomass accumulation. Legumes in poorly fertile fields had significantly smaller shoot δ 15 N enrichment (- 2. 8 to + 0. 7 ‰) and a larger %Ndfa (55 - 94 %) than those in fertile fields (- 0. 8 to + 2. 2 ‰; 23 - 85 %). The N 2 -fixed however was larger in fertile fields (16 - 145 kgNha- 1) than in poorly fertile fields (15 - 123 kgNha- 1) due to greater shoot dry matter and N yields. The legumes grown in the NGS obtained more of their N requirements from atmospheric N 2 -fixation (73 - 88 %) than legumes grown in the SGS (41 - 69 %). The partial soil N balance (inkgha- 1) was comparable between intercrops (- 14 to 21) and sole legumes (- 8 to 23) but smaller than that of sole maize receiving N fertiliser (+ 7 to + 34). With other N inputs (<b>aerial</b> deposition) and <b>outputs</b> (leaching and gaseous losses) unaccounted for, there is uncertainty surrounding the actual amount of soil N balances of the cropping systems, indicating that partial N balances are not reliable indicators of the sustainability of cropping systems. Nevertheless, the systems with legumes seem more attractive due to several non-N benefits. Our results suggest that soybean could be targeted in the SGS and cowpea in the NGS for greater productivity while groundnut is suited to both environments. Grain legumes grown in poorly fertile fields contributed more net N to the soil but growing legumes in fertile fields seems more lucrative due to greater grain and stover yields and non-N benefits...|$|R
