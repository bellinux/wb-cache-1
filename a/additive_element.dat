The glass structural difference of cast glassy samples is mainly originated to the difference of those cooling rates. In order to clarify the degree of amorphousness, we use the volume change during annealing just below glass transition temperature (Tg) in this study. Therefore the volume change has close relation with free volume. We tried to control the excess free volume in Zr-TM-Al (TM: Cu, Ni and Co) bulk glassy alloys (BGAs) using small <b>additive</b> <b>element.</b> We found the elements; Pd, Ag, Pt and Au, whose outer d-electrons are filled up, are effective to increase the volume change/free volume in Zr-Cu-Al BGAs.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the fatigue {{strength}} of Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 BGAs during 10 3 – 104 cycles, we tried to use the small <b>additive</b> <b>element.</b> As a result, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au are effective addition elements to enhance the fatigue strength. Especially, the additive Pd element has a beneficial effect on the fatigue-strength enhancement. The additive Pd element promotes the glass-structure expansion, which can be recognized from the volume change due to the structural relaxation. Consequently, we found the linear relationship between the fatigue limit and volume change in Zr 50 Cu 40 XAl 10 PdX [X: 0 – 7 atomic percent (at%) ] glassy alloys. Furthermore, we conclude that {{the origin of the}} unique hardness distribution on the fatigue-fractured surface is probably related to hydrogen hardening. The Zr 50 Cu 37 Al 10 Pd 3 glassy alloy, which exhibits the highest fatigue limit of 1, 050 MPa, shows a superior resistance force against the hydrogen hardening. Thus, maintaining the balance between the hardening and embrittlement around the fatigue crack tip by hydrogen is the significant factor to enhance the fatigue strengths.

40|$|The {{precipitation}} type {{aluminum alloys}} have excellent {{performance as the}} increasing rate in electric resistivity with additives in the precipitation state is considerably low, {{compared to that of}} the aluminum alloy with additives in the solid-solution state. It is possible to enhance the mechanical strength without remarkable degradation in residual resistivity ratio (RRR) by increasing content of selected additive elements. Nickel is the suitable <b>additive</b> <b>element</b> because it has very low solubility in aluminum and low increasing rate in electric resistivity, and furthermore, nickel and aluminum form intermetallic compounds which effectively resist the motion of dislocations.

Results obtained are as follows: 1. The Mg-alloys containing Ⅲa transition metals could absorb much more amounts of hydrogen than magnesium-itself and form hydrides of the metals in the matrix. 2. These hydrides were identified as ScH 2, YH 2, and HoH 2, respectively, and formed on the specific crystallographic planes in the magnesium matrix. They were so stable {{that they did not}} decompose by heat treatment in a vacuum at the hydrogenating temperature. 3. The Mg-Sc alloys were hardened by internal hydriding, while softening took place in the Mg-Y and Mg-Ho alloys by hydriding. This discrepancy might be attributed to the difference in compromise between the decrease of solid solution hardening and the increase of dispersion hardening by hydriding. However, because of dispersed stable hydrides, all the internally hydrided alloys were expected to have an appreciable strength at high temperatures. 4.

40|$|Nowadays, {{almost all}} the cutting tools in metal {{machining}} are protected with a surface treatment. Nevertheless, {{this is not the}} case in woodmachining where no tools are protected, except by thermal treatments, and so they present a previous wear because of the use of steel or carbide materials in milling, sawing, routing, etc. During these processes, the tools are particularly exposed to abrasive and shock wear. To enhance their wear resistance, one solution is to protect them with hard coatings. The present study deals with the development of ternary systems (CrAlN and CrSiN) obtained by two PVD different magnetron sputtering systems [‘A’ (laboratory where CrAlN layers have been obtained) and ‘B’ (laboratory where CrSiN layers have been obtained) in the following text] on carbide WC–Co tools used in second transformation of wood to be compared to the binary CrN one. CrAlN and CrSiN films were deposited with different Al and Si contents, respectively, in order to check the effect of the <b>additive</b> <b>element</b> (Al or Si) on the different properties of the Cr–N system. The different coatings were characterized by SEM and EDS for thickness measurements, morphology and composition analyses, respectively, by nanoindentation for hardness and Young’s modulus measurements and by pin-on-disc to determine their friction coefficient. Routing of medium density fibreboard (MDF) was realized employing untreated or modified carbide WC–Co tools in order to compare their wear resistance. We observed that the Al and the Si addition improved the hardness and the Young’s modulus of the Cr–N system (‘A’: 29 and 410 GPa, respectively, ‘B’: 18 and 280 GPa, respectively). Indeed, the hardness values are 15 – 36 GPa for CrAlN and 15 – 24 GPa for CrSiN coatings. Besides, the Young’s modulus values are 331 – 520 GPa for CrAlN and 260 – 320 GPa for CrSiN coatings. The friction coefficient of the CrAlN layers varied between 0. 6 and 0. 7 and it increased slightly with the Al content. For the CrSiN coatings, the friction coefficient was lower and about 0. 4. In both cases, the CrN layers ‘A’ and ‘B’ presented similar friction coefficient than CrAlN and CrSiN, respectively. During the routing of MDF, the CrN ‘A’ coating has a similar wear behaviour than the optimized CrAlN one (5 at. % of Al) while the optimized CrSiN coating (1. 2 at. % of Si) showed a better behaviour against wear than the CrN ‘B’ one.

40|$|The need to {{stabilise}} or even {{reduce the}} production of anthropogenic CO 2 makes the capture of CO 2 during energy generation from carbonaceous fuels, e. g. coal or biomass, necessary for the future. For hydrogen, an environmentally-benign energy vector whose sole combustion product is water, to become a major energy source, it must be produced in an efficient, CO 2 -neutral manner. A process, which uses a packed bed of iron and its oxides, viz. Fe, Fe 0 : 947 O, Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3, has been formulated to produce separate, pure streams of H 2 and CO 2. The process is exothermic and has the following stages: 1. Reduction of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 0 : 947 O or Fe in syngas (CO + H 2) from gasifying coal or biomass. This stage generates pure CO 2 for sequestration, once the water has been condensed. 2. Subsequent oxidation of Fe or Fe 0 : 947 O to Fe 3 O 4 using steam. This stage generates H 2 of sufficient purity for use in polymeric membrane fuel cells. 3. Further oxidation of Fe 3 O 4 to Fe 2 O 3 using air to return the oxide to step (1). It was shown that reduction to Fe 0 : 947 O in step (1) gave stable yields of H 2 in step (2) after 40 cycles, near those predicted from reaction stoichiometry. By contrast, reduction to Fe, rather than Fe 0 : 947 O, in step (1) gave low levels of H 2 in step (2) after just 10 cycles. This demonstrates that modifying the iron oxide is unnecessary unless reduction to Fe is performed. Wet-impregnation of Fe 2 O 3 was performed with salts of Al, Cr and Mg or with tetraethyl orthosilicate for Si to give loadings of 1 - 30 mol % of the <b>additive</b> <b>element.</b> The addition of Al stabilised the quantity of H 2 produced when the sample was reduced to Fe. Using a sol-gel method, composite particles with diff erent mass ratios of Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 were prepared. For reduction to Fe over 40 cycles, 40 wt. % Al 2 O 3 was required to give stable conversions near 75 % of that expected from reaction stoichiometry. Prior to this research, it had been assumed that the alumina acted as an inert support. However, this was shown to be incorrect since the formation of FeO. Al 2 O 3 was quantitatively confirmed using X-ray diffraction. The presence of the compound, FeO. Al 2 O 3, is significant since it reduces the loss in internal surface area but binds reactive iron, two contradictory e ects for {{the production of}} H 2. The production of separate streams of pure H 2 and CO 2 from solid fuels, lignite and subbituminous coal, was demonstrated. Pure H 2 with [CO] ~< 50 ppmv and [SO 2] ~~ 0 ppmv was produced from a low-rank coal, showing that the process is e cacious with an impure fuel. Contaminants found in syngas which are gaseous above 273 K apparently do not adversely affect the iron oxide material or purity of the hydrogen. Subsequent oxidation of the Fe 3 O 4 with air, step (3), removed sulphurous and carbonaceous contaminants deposited during reduction, generated useful heat and did not lead to a decrease in the H 2 yield in step (2). It is therefore recommended that step (3) be included in the process. Rates of reaction are reported for the reduction of iron oxide particles by a mixture of CO, CO 2 and N 2. Importantly, rates were investigated over multiple cycles. Reduction of either Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 or of Fe 3 O 4 to Fe 0 : 947 O was found to be first-order in CO. With the particle sizes used, the rates of reduction were controlled by intrinsic chemical kinetics. Activation energies and pre-exponential factors are reported. The rates were used to simulate, satisfactorily, the reduction of a packed bed of iron oxide. The rate of reduction was doubled by the addition of 1 mol. % Ce to the granulated iron oxide. The overall rate was shown to be dependent on the active surface area of the iron oxide. A lattice Boltzmann model, which incorporates hydrodynamics, mass transport and reaction, was developed. The composition of the solid changed with time. Quantitative agreement between the model and experiments for the reduction of a single particle of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 in CO was achieved. Additionally, the model correctly predicted a sharp front in the CO concentration for reduction of a packed bed of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4...|$|E
