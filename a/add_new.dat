5|$|Despite its age, Worms Armageddon still {{receives}} periodic updates, {{mainly from}} two programmers known as Deadcode and CyberShadow, recruited by Team17. These updates address bugs and compatibility issues, and also <b>add</b> <b>new</b> features to the game, such as {{support for a}} greater number of worms in a match and support for arbitrarily-sized colour levels. The latest update was on 19 March 2013.|$|E

5|$|There {{should be}} a {{continuous}} effort to simplify the code, because otherwise just adding capabilities will slowly increase the software complexity. The code should be refactored over time to make it simple and clear, not just constantly <b>add</b> <b>new</b> features. The goal should be code that is “obviously right”, as opposed to code that is so complicated that “I can’t see any problems”.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} {{foundational}} code for Maniac Mansion, {{the majority of the}} game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to <b>add</b> <b>new</b> elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E

The {{developers}} {{of the game}} continually <b>add</b> <b>new</b> heroes, each with different skills but balanced for fair play.

There is a set number of heroes that are free to play, with the free to play roster being renewed every week.|$|E

Teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record with any remaining ties broken by strength of schedule. Playoff participants are sequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and Super Bowl).|$|E

The Commissioning Program is now the longest-running commissioning program for wind band music in American history, and has produced works that have secured {{a place in the}} emerging band canon and have garnered critical acclaim, such as Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the release, Howse worked on updates {{to stabilize the}} game and provide a better experience for players. In addition, he plans to <b>add</b> <b>new</b> features, such as a friendly mode; another mode that allows people to set up teams; and {{a way for the}} player to choose a server to play on. Howse said that two major gaming companies had approached him to buy Slither.io. He had considered the idea, since he felt that it was stressful to maintain the game.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 2010, the Naval Air Systems Command awarded Bell Boeing a $42.1 million {{contract}} to design an integrated processor {{in response to}} avionics obsolescence and <b>add</b> <b>new</b> network capabilities.

In February 2012, the Marine Corps received the first Block C Ospreys; these aircraft feature a new radar, along with additional mission management and electronic warfare equipment. In 2015, options for upgrading all aircraft to the V-22C standard were examined.|$|E

5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a fire on {{a subway}} train at Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles, and resulted in {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway system more accessible, <b>add</b> <b>new</b> bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} underwent {{some minor}} alterations during its 50 years of {{use by the}} Federal Reserve, consisting mostly of routine maintenance and upgrades. In 1958, the exterior was cleaned and waterproofed at the recommendation of architect William J. Bain, resulting in the discoloring of the limestone cladding. In the 1980s, the building's roof and windows were replaced {{under the direction of}} HNTB. Portions of the building were renovated in the 1990s to <b>add</b> <b>new</b> employee amenities, including a cafeteria and conference room.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team schedules {{the release}} of a major update approximately every three months.

Minor patches that come in between major updates focus on quality of life changes. In addition to regular free updates, the game features full expansion packs that <b>add</b> <b>new</b> zones, races, jobs, and premiere a new content cycle.

5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to <b>add</b> <b>new</b> shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to <b>add</b> <b>new</b> miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to <b>add</b> <b>new</b> elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E
