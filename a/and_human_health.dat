40|$|Abstract: The role {{climate change}} may play in {{altering}} <b>human</b> <b>health,</b> {{particularly in the}} emergence and spread of diseases, is an evolving area of research. It {{is important to understand}} this relationship because it will compound the already significant burden of diseases on national economies and public health. Authorities {{need to be able to}} assess, anticipate, <b>and</b> monitor <b>human</b> <b>health</b> vulnerability to climate change, in order to plan for, or implement action to avoid these eventualities. Environmental health indicators (EHIs) provide a tool to assess, monitor, <b>and</b> quantify <b>human</b> <b>health</b> vulnerability, to aid in the design and targeting of interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Our aim was to identify the most suitab le framework for developing EHIs to measure and monitor the impacts of climate change on <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> inform the development of interventions. Using published literature we reviewed the attributes of 11 frameworks. We identified the Driving force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework as the most suitable one for developing EHIs for climate change and health. We propose the use of EHIs as a valuable tool to assess, quantify, <b>and</b> monitor <b>human</b> <b>health</b> vulnerability, design <b>and</b> targe...|$|R
