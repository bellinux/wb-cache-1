40|$|The {{objective}} of this scientific research is application of the basic model of interaction between phases of a cycle <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> organizational and technological processes underway at industrial enterprises. The authors describe interactions between all six phases of the process <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> {{within the framework of}} the basic model of a cycle that contemplates organizational and technological processes. Engineering studies are necessary to check for the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial enterprises and application of results extracted from the design documentation with a view to <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> production activities and construction operations. Upon completion of the decision-making process concerning the need for reorganization in accordance with the basic model of interaction between phases, there occurs restructuring that incorporates processes of design and construction. The authors have demonstrated that <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the basic model cycle should be used in the design of organizational and technological processes with a view to the integrated consideration <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> enterprises in order to comprehend and improve the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> at each stage, as well as the control over the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> a construction facility.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this scientific research {{is to develop a}} theoretical model of organizational and technology-related processes <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial enterprises, as well as their interaction. Multipoint logic notions of growth and interaction phases are used as research methods. The author describes the basic stages <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> the life cycle of industrial enterprises and the cycle of their transformation. The processes are presented as an infographical image that represents a concentric model of interaction. This concentric model represents interaction between two or more phases. The process is entitled infografical modeling on the polyfunctional level. The concentric model moves both clockwise and anti-clockwise. Basic organizational and technological processes <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial enterprises that include decision making in terms <b>of</b> expediency <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> design, construction, and performance of industrial enterprises at full capacity, and further operation of the industrial enterprise are described in the paper. Attainment of this objective, namely, <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> an industrial enterprise, involves a huge amount of resources, including labour resources that need interaction with all parties of reorganization; therefore, the concentric model of interaction describing the basic cycle <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> the life cycle of an industrial enterprise and the cycle of its conversion is a trustworthy representation of this process. The proposed concentric model of interaction should be used in the design of organizational and technology-related processes for integrated consideration <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> enterprises required to understand and improve the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>reorganizations</b> and to control the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial facilities.

40|$|The {{enactment}} of the 2006 Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC marked a new stage in China’s bankruptcy regime by the inclusion <b>of</b> a new <b>reorganization</b> system. The first 5 years of {{the implementation of the}} law and further scholarly research, however, have exposed the problems that underlie it, especially those concerning the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> listed companies. The pressing need to address these problems calls for {{a better understanding of the}} goals <b>of</b> <b>reorganization.</b> This is because it is by applying the criterion of what best serves the desired reorganization goals that distinguishes an optimal from a less-than-optimal reorganization law and sense from nonsense in its implementation. Thus far, however, no scholar has carried out systemic research <b>of</b> China’s <b>reorganization</b> goals. This thesis, set out in two parts, attempts to fill this gap in the literature for both the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> legislation and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> implementation in China. Employing the methods of theoretical analysis, economic analysis of law, case analysis and comparative study, the first part of this thesis argues that preserving going-concern surplus and fair distribution are the two fundamental goals <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> in China. Although protecting community interest is important, it should be considered only an incidental goal <b>of</b> <b>reorganization.</b> The second part of this thesis examines how the most important aspects <b>of</b> the current <b>reorganization</b> system under the EBL can be improved so as to better achieve the two fundamental goals in reality. As to the goal of preserving going-concern surplus, it discusses the early rescue, preservation and sale of the viable parts of the business in a distressed enterprise. As to the goal of fair distribution, it analyzes both the distributional boundaries and rules <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> with a focus on the absolute priority rule. How to balance the values underlying the two fundamental goals <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> and the practical impediments to the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>reorganization</b> law are then discussed. Both a sound grasp <b>of</b> the <b>reorganization</b> goals under the EBL and a deep understanding of why and how specific reorganization mechanisms and provisions exist to serve these goals are needed. Only with such understanding, together with a grasp of the relationships between different fundamental goals and different mechanisms and provisions, can the efforts aiming to improve China’s reorganization system achieve the desired level of effectiveness as a whole. published_or_final_versionLawMasterDoctor of Legal Studie...|$|R

The current research allows to define the essence of own capital in conditions <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> economical societies as the obligation before economical societies-sellers’ owners about the exchange of their corporative rights ensured with net assets for the corporative rights in the society of legal successor.

40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{performed}} the statistical {{presentation of the}} formation of prices for food <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> agriculture in Poland in long periods of time. In the beginning he showed the methods of presentation and the possibilities of their application, then in the essential part the surveyed the internal and vertical relation of prices against the background of changes of social and economical structure of the country. At first he discussed the elements of social structure that have the indirect influence: the demographic and professional structure; later on he perceived the direct influence in the market relations and differentiation of the prices of production. Analysing the relations of dynamics of purchase-prices, the author perceived in their forming the increase of participation of the producers in retail-prices as the result of price policy. Presenting the relations of purchase-prices to market-prices the author connected them with relations <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> sale; whereas the formation of internal relations of market prices he analysed in connection with relations <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> production or consumption. Studying the relations of retail-prices in the socialized trade to market prices the author saw the reasons of their forming in <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> purchases from consumers' side in the situation of lack of market balance. In the last remarks the author presented the conclusions and observations concerning the correlations of relation of prices with the social and economic structure of the country in long periods of time.
