5|$|There is found, in {{northern}} Poitou, donkeys which are {{as tall as}} large mules. They are almost completely covered in hair a half-foot long with legs and joints <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> those of a carriage horse.|$|E
5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate {{a higher level of}} intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|Due to Madagascar's highly {{seasonal}} climate, lemur evolution {{has produced a}} level of species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E
30|$|Schochet (2009) {{shows that}} a regression {{discontinuity}} design typically requires a sample {{three to four}} times <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> experimental design to achieve the same level of statistical precision.|$|R
50|$|The largest known dinoceratan was Uintatherium. It {{was about}} the size of a rhinoceros. Despite its large size, it had <b>a</b> brain only about <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> orange.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, when Rollo's {{father and}} mother arrived at the front door, they found Rollo ready there with a small ball of twine in his hand, about <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> apple.|$|R
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E
5|$|The shells {{are made}} of cast iron, <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; {{and when they get}} there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E
25|$|Slow moving sea spiders are common, {{sometimes}} growing <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> human hand. They {{feed on the}} corals, sponges, and bryozoans that {{litter the}} seabed.|$|E
5000|$|The music {{aggregating}} website AllMusic lists 1,171 albums {{on which}} [...] "The Nashville String Machine" [...] is credited (from 1972 through 2015). The group has appeared <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> orchestra, or <b>as</b> small <b>as</b> <b>a</b> duo.|$|R
50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above definition, UML places no {{restriction}} on the granularity of a component. Thus, a component may be <b>as</b> small <b>as</b> <b>a</b> figures-to-words converter, or <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> entire document management system.|$|R
60|$|Margery was all obedience. She {{took it off}} {{and handed}} it to him. The Baron rolled and {{compressed}} it with all his force till it was about <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> apple-dumpling, and put it into his pocket.|$|R
25|$|They compete poorly with {{saltwater}} crocodiles; however, {{this species}} is saltwater tolerant. Adult crocodiles eat fish, birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians, although larger individuals may take prey <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wallaby.|$|E
25|$|Megalomys desmarestii, a {{very large}} oryzomyine that became extinct by about 1900. It was closely related to Megalomys luciae, which {{occurred}} further south on Saint Lucia. It was <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cat.|$|E
25|$|The mouse deer, a small tusked deer <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> toy dog or cat, mostly can {{be found}} on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia) and in Palawan Islands (Philippines). The gaur, a {{gigantic}} wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.|$|E
50|$|Dekatrons come {{in various}} {{physical}} sizes, ranging from {{smaller than a}} 7-pin miniature vacuum tube to <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octal base tube. While most dekatrons are decimal counters, models were also made to count in base-5 and base-12 for specific applications.|$|R

25|$|A second, {{quite common}} type {{looks like a}} Schuko socket, but adds a central {{earthing}} hole. This design can accept CEE7/4 (German), CEE7/7 (German/French), and Italian 10A plugs. Some of these sockets may also have figure-8 shaped holes to accept Italian 16A plugs as well. Its drawback {{is that it is}} twice <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normal Italian socket and the price is higher; for those reasons Schuko and bipasso-Schuko socket have been rarely installed in Italy until recent times.|$|E
25|$|In {{heavy-duty}} industrial high-current applications, a grid resistor {{is a large}} convection-cooled lattice of {{stamped metal}} alloy strips connected in rows between two electrodes. Such industrial grade resistors can be <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> refrigerator; some designs can handle over 500 amperes of current, {{with a range of}} resistances extending lower than 0.04 ohms. They are used in applications such as dynamic braking and load banking for locomotives and trams, neutral grounding for industrial AC distribution, control loads for cranes and heavy equipment, load testing of generators and harmonic filtering for electric substations.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Togawa {{spoke with}} a local hunter {{who claimed to have}} killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He {{disposed}} of the body, and Haemi on {{the southern part of the}} island, where the body was disposed of, was searched. The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away. He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> house cat's, and greenish striped fur.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pages}} of Avengers World, it is {{revealed}} that Madripoor rests {{on the head of}} a giant dragon that is <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> island continent. The giant dragon was awakened by a ritual performed by Gorgon and the Hand. The beast decides to attack Shanghai, China.|$|R

50|$|The Soviet Army was {{organized}} into fronts (фронт, pl. фронты) which were often <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> army group. (See List of Soviet fronts in World War II.) Some of the fronts contained Allied formations raised in exile. For example, the Polish First Army {{was part of}} the 1st Belorussian Front.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} Proteus {{is close to}} a sphere with a radius of about 210km, {{although}} deviations from the spherical shape are large—up to 20km; scientists believe it is about <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated {{in the direction of}} Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.|$|E
25|$|In December 2002, a new International Arrivals Building opened west of Terminal B. This {{structure}} {{houses the}} Federal Inspection Station and has one jetway for deboarding aircraft. Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, {{which included the}} building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB. International departures will be handled from the existing terminal complex.|$|E
25|$|Gulls are monogamous {{and colonial}} breeders that display mate {{fidelity}} that usually lasts {{for the life}} of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of site fidelity, returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of band-tailed gulls may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are territorial, defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 5-m radius around the nest in the herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakes.|$|E
50|$|Madripoor is {{estimated}} to be 100 mi in diameter. Its coastline is pockmarked with deep water bays and inlets. The center of the island is a large plateau with steep cliffs. As mentioned above, Madripoor rests on the head of a giant dragon that is <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> island continent.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} open 24 hours daily. <b>As</b> well <b>as</b> {{being able to}} serve {{aircraft}} <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Antonov An-124, the airport has a heliport that allows it to serve helicopters, alongside fixed-wing aircraft. Due to its distance from the city centre, there are no noise restrictions enforced at the airport.|$|R
50|$|Of Cretaceous age, Aquia Creek {{sandstone}} {{is composed}} of rounded, coarse- to fine-grains of quartz, cemented with silica and containing scattered pellets of clay <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inch in diameter. This sandstone is typically gray or tan, sometimes with streaks or shades of red, yellow or buff, giving the stone a warm effect.|$|R
25|$|When Bols {{was finally}} offered {{the command of}} the 6th Airborne Division in 1944, he had not {{previously}} commanded a military formation <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> division. Bols took command shortly before Christmas of 1944, superseding the previous General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Richard Gale, who had raised the division and commanded it during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. He was granted the acting rank of major general from 6 December 1944. When he took command the division, comprising the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades and the 6th Airlanding Brigades along with supporting units, {{was back in the}} United Kingdom, expecting a quiet Christmas training and reorganising after being withdrawn from Normandy in September. However, with the situation in the Ardennes deteriorating it was thrown into the Battle of the Bulge to support American forces in repelling the German counter-offensive between December 1944 and January 1945, one of {{only a small number of}} British formations to do so. The 6th Airborne Division conducted a counter-attack beginning 3 January alongside other British units, advancing against fierce German resistance until the division linked up with elements of the U.S. Third Army, under Lieutenant General George S. Patton.|$|E
500|$|The {{cladistic}} {{analysis by}} Sellés and Galobart in 2015 supported an ornithischian parentage. Late Campanian to early Maastrichtian ornithischians from Southwestern Europe {{are restricted to}} rhabdodontids and the nodosaurid Struthiosaurus. When Sellés and Galobart analyzed the pelvises of Rhabdodon (the largest known rhabdodontid) and Struthiosaurus, they found that Rhabdodon could not have laid eggs as big as Cairanoolithus. On the other hand, even though Struthiosaurus was relatively small, the unique orientation of its ischia would have easily allowed it to lay eggs <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] cairanoolithid egg. However, interpreting Cairanoolithus as the eggs of a nodosaur does {{raise the question of}} why Cairanoolithus or similar eggs have not been found in areas with a greater nodosaur abundance.|$|E
500|$|The koala lemurs of {{the family}} Megaladapidae most closely {{resemble}} marsupial koalas from Australia. [...] According to genetic evidence they were most {{closely related to the}} family Lemuridae, although for many years they were paired with the sportive lemurs {{of the family}} Lepilemuridae due to similarities in their skulls and molar teeth. [...] They were slow climbers and had long forelimbs and powerful grasping feet, possibly using them for suspension. [...] Koala lemurs ranged in size from an estimated , making them <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> male orangutan or a female gorilla. [...] They had poor day vision, short tails, lacked permanent upper incisors, and had a reduced toothcomb. [...] Their diet generally consisted of leaves, with some species being specialized folivores and others having a broader diet, possibly including tough seeds.|$|E
50|$|The precepting {{authorities}} are councils from other levels {{of local government}} such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> county or parish councils and other agencies.
