40|$|International audienceFifty-eight {{brands of}} balsamic vinegars were {{analyzed}} for lead concentrations and isotopic compositions ((204) Pb, (206) Pb, (207) Pb, and (208) Pb) {{to test the}} findings of a previous study indicating relatively high levels of lead contamination in some of those vinegars more than two thirds (70 %) of them exceeded California's State Maximum Level (34 mu g/L) based on consumption rates >= 0. 5 mu g Pb per day. The Lead isotopic fingerprints of all those vinegars with high lead concentrations were then found to be primarily anthropogenic. This isotopic analysis unquestionably reveals multiple contamination sources including atmospheric pollutant Pb and an unidentified contamination source, likely occurring after grape harvest. Organically grown grape vinegars display the same Pb content and isotopic signatures as other vinegars. This implies that pesticides might not be a significant source of pollutant Pb in vinegars. A significant post-harvest contamination would be inherited from chemicals added during production and/or material used during transport, processing or storage of these vinegars. This is consistent with the highest Pb levels being found in <b>aged</b> <b>vinegars</b> (112 +/- 112 mu g/L) in contrast to other vinegars (41. 6 +/- 28. 9 mu g/L) suggesting contamination during storage. It is, therefore, projected that lead levels in most vinegars, especially aged balsamic and wine vinegars, will decrease with improvements in their manufacture and storage processes consequential to recent concerns of elevated levels of lead in some vinegars.

40|$|The term ‘balsamic vinegar’ is {{frequently}} applied to describe sauces, condiments and dressings with particular sweet taste. In Italy {{there are two}} types of balsamic vinegar: ‘balsamic vinegar of Modena’ and ‘traditional balsamic vinegar’. The first is a flavoured wine vinegar obtained by blending cooked must and wine vinegar and, in some cases, by adding a small amount of caramel. Traditional balsamic vinegar (TBV) is made in Modena and Reggio Emilia with cooked grape must, through a three-step process: conversion of sugars to ethanol by yeasts; oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria (AAB); and, finally, at least 12 years of ageing.

The extraction of dihydrorobinetin was first optimized by evaluating the influence of various extraction parameters such as temperature, extraction time, solvent nature, and wood/solvent mass ratio to obtain an efficient, safe, and low cost extraction. Then, dihydrorobinetin was purified over 95 % using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC).

40|$|Traditional balsamic <b>vinegar</b> (TBV) is <b>aged</b> for a {{long time}} in a set of barrels {{arranged}} in decreasing scalar volume. New cooked must is added and aliquots of product are transferred from barrel to barrel every year; this procedure generates a blend of <b>vinegars</b> of different <b>ages.</b> These ages have been described by sequences of real numbers depending upon the number of year of the barrel set and volume of vinegar transferred. A theoretic study of these sequences has shown that there is a finite limit for the <b>age</b> of <b>vinegar</b> and this upper limit can be formulated through the values of both the volume of vinegar in the barrels and the transferred one. Namely, we have proved that the real ages, in any single barrel, are strictly increasing and with a finite limit as the number of years of the barrels set goes to infinity and we calculated these limits. From a practical point of view, the proposed mathematical model allowed us to define formulas able to calculate the maximum amount of TBV that each producer can sell as a limited product, in the hypothesis that the vinegar has been reached the minimal legal age required of 12 years. In addition, since the independent agency that officially states TBV authenticity has also the authority to inspect the producer's factory and therefore to know exactly how much TBV is withdrawn, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the public agency is able to found all data required to calculate the <b>vinegar</b> <b>age</b> by the proposed model...|$|R

50|$|Yield {{indicates}} {{the ability of}} a barrel set to concentrate cooked must at given operating conditions being dependent on the rate of water loss by evaporation. Low yields are due both to relatively low withdrawn and high water evaporation rates. The latter is the major factor lowering the TBV yield.

As a consequence, when the yield is low, the <b>vinegar</b> <b>age</b> might be relatively low {{as a function of the}} amount of cooked must used to refill.Applying the spreadsheet of the theoretical model to a barrel set as in figure, the residence time obtained as a function of withdrawn quantity and evaporation rate is plotted in the concerning graph.|$|R
40|$|Near {{infrared}} spectroscopy combined with several chemometrical techniques {{has been used}} to control the <b>aging</b> process in <b>vinegar</b> and the changes produced during storage. Several considerations regarding NIR instrument changes, which can add noise to the determinations, were made and a strategy based on the correction of the spectra was used to eliminate the differences between spectra due to instrument variation, in particular to lamp change. Ninety-five different vinegars were measured using a near-infrared spectrometer. The spectrum of each vinegar sample was collected twice: the first time as soon as the bottle was opened and the vinegar had not undergone any oxidation process and the second measurement was taken after a certain period of time. Then, in order to quantify the discrimination between the two groups of spectra recorded in the two occasions and so to estimate the aging effect in the vinegar samples, Linear Discriminant Analysis was used as a classification method. To improve the results, bearing in mind that many of the measured variables could be useless and that the elimination of these wavelengths can help in interpretation, a feature selection technique was applied. For chemical interpretation of the retained wavelengths, the spectral zones correlated with the aging process were isolated and the species and compounds that can absorb in these NIR spectra bands were studied...|$|R
40|$|A lot {{of sweet}} and sour vinegars and dressing, derived from grape must and appealed as “balsamic”, are {{currently}} available in the market all over the world. We have grouped the different products {{on the basis of}} their Protected Geographical Status, ingredients and additives used, as well as the production technology. The consumer perception of the attribute “balsamic” isassociated with a series of common features that clearly discriminates them from other types of vinegars. They are dark, opalescent, shiny, thick and viscous, and the acidic taste is modulated by a variable amount of sugars. The features described are usually achieved in different ways and this make the difference among the balsamic vinegarsand sauces. The key point refers to the fact that different methods, used for the same purpose, can have dramaticallydifferent costs, which then affect the price and quality of the finished product; i. e. the dark colour can be obtained with addition of caramel (E 150 d) or by long aging. The differences on production cost is huge and obvious. The most expensive step in industrial production is aging, and of course this is particularly important for traditional balsamic <b>vinegars.</b> <b>Aging</b> plays a key role in determining many valuable characteristics of balsamic, for example, the dark brown colour belongs from the initial process of must cooking, which triggers a series of non-enzymatic browning reactions that slowly continue over the years. The process of aging in wood barrels increases the specific gravityand viscosity due to the progressive loss of water and theformation of high molecular weight compounds (melanoidins) that modify the rheological properties of the product...|$|R
40|$|Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale of Modena (ABTM) is {{a typical}} product (PDO denomination) of the {{province}} of Modena produced by cooked grape must which undergoes a long ageing period (at least 12 years) in series of wooden casks (batterie). The study of the transformations of this product during ageing is extremely relevant {{in order to control}} the authenticity of ABTM towards succedaneous products and mislabelling of age. This paper presents the results of the investigation of sugars and fixed organic acids in ABTM samples of different ages, coming from different batterie. The analytes were simultaneously determined by a gas chromatographic method optimised for this peculiar matrix. The method shows good separation and resolution of the investigated chemical species and allows their determination in the concentration ranges reported in brackets: malic (7. 6 - 15. 5 g kg(- 1)), tartaric (4. 0 - 9. 7 g kg(- 1)), citric (0. 6 - 1. 5 g kg(- 1)) and succinic (0. 36 - 0. 62 g kg(- 1)) acid and glucose (153 - 294 g kg(- 1)), fructose (131 - 279 g kg(- 1)), xylose (011 - 0. 39 g kg(- 1)), ribose (0. 078 - 0. 429 g kg(- 1)), rhamnose (0. 061 - 0. 195 g kg(- 1)), galactose (0. 136 - 0. 388 g kg(- 1)), mannose (0. 41 - 1. 46 g kg(- 1)), arabinose (0. 33 - 1. 00 g kg(- 1)) and sucrose (0. 46 - 6. 84 g kg(- 1)), with mean associated errors ranging from 5 to 19 % depending on the analytes. Moreover, the recovery values are always satisfactory, being close to one for most of the analytes. Furthermore, in order to assess the degree of variability of the different analytes content with <b>vinegar</b> <b>ageing</b> and the similarity/dissimilarity among series of casks a three-way data analysis method (Tucker 3) is proposed.

40|$|Traditional {{balsamic vinegar}} (TBV) {{production}} involves some distinct steps: the cooking of the must {{is followed by}} its alcoholic and acetic fermentation; then, during the aging in a barrel set, the volume loss due to evaporation is restored according to the technique of "rincalzo” (topping up). This procedure leads {{to a set of}} barrel containing a mixture of <b>vinegars</b> of different <b>ages,</b> so the real age of the finished product can only be defined as a “residence time” (RT), obtained as a weighted average among each aliquots of vinegar mixed through the years. From an algebraic point of view, the problem has been solved and the result is a mathematical model in which the TBV age is easily estimated from the volumes involved in the maintenance of the barrel set. While it is intuitive and commonly accepted that losses affect the yield of the barrel set, it is more interesting to clarify the relationship between yield, evaporation rate and age of TBV. The lower is the yield, due to losses by evaporation and other causes, the lower is the RT and thus the effective aging. The intensity of aging of TBV is indeed inversely proportional to the flow of vinegar through the barrel set. This simulation system has been modified by excluding the water, so the calculation can be based on the actual matter that undergoes aging, ie the solutes dissolved in the vinegar. To this end, the solute losses, due to chemical and physical phenomena and biological activities, have been quantified for every stages of TBV production. Based on the mass balance performed, a rigorous calculations can be set, in order to simulate the trend of the RT and concentration profile for the product. Yields calculated in this manner are consistent with data collected from different barrel sets for a few years and it is clearly evident that the yield significantly influences the RT of TBV: older TBVs correspond to high yields. The calculation of the RT on the basis of dry mass, besides being more correct because the aging process does not affect water, provides higher values than those calculated by the volume, and these differences are greater for the most <b>aged</b> barrels of <b>vinegar.</b> In short, increasing the yields of the aging process is equivalent to increase the quality of TBV. Several researchers tried to correlate the chemical composition to the age of TBV but no satisfactory results have been achieved. Recently, melanoidins start to seem a good indicator of TBV aging, since these compounds vary in terms of quality and quantity during the residence time of TBV in the barrels. (empty line...|$|R
