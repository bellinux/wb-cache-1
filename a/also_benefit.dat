5|$|Young AAC users {{benefit from}} rich {{language}} and literacy experiences to foster vocabulary development, discourse skills, and phonological awareness, {{all of which}} supports successful literacy learning. Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child, such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate, including using the individual's communication system themselves. They <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from focussed and explicit reading instruction.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E
5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from the diet.|$|E
5|$|While much wetland habitat {{has been}} {{eliminated}} due to human activity, new muskrat habitat {{has been created}} by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the muskrat remains common and widespread. They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from human persecution {{of some of their}} predators.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E

5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E

25|$|The state's tax {{policies}} {{relative to}} other states make Maryland competitive, according to the Tax Foundation. Maryland businesses <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from credits, exemptions and business loss deductions. As a result, when taking into account both the tax rate and base, Maryland is ranked as 14th best state for corporate taxes.|$|E

25|$|When youth {{participate}} in established empowerment programs {{they see a}} variety of benefits. The practices of youth involvement and empowerment become embedded within the organizational culture and the community culture. Adults and organizations <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from empowerment programs. The both become more connected and responsive to youth in the community, which leads to program improvements as well as increased participation from youth.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 {{report by}} the U.S. {{government}} report identifies the current challenges facing the education system, including the high dropout rate among high school students. The country needs even more workers who are fluent in English and languages such as Portuguese, Mandarin and French. It would <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from more graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs, according to the report.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} cross-subsidies in the tariff structure. Medium voltage {{consumers}} pay higher tariffs that serve to subsidize lower tariffs for low voltage consumers. Users that consume less than 150 kWh per month receive transfers {{from the rest}} of the consumers. The lowest-consumption users (0-50kWh/month) benefit from reductions between 45% and 63% in their average tariff. Consumers above the 50kWh limit <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from the subsidy scheme to a smaller extent.|$|E

25|$|A very {{important}} point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that weedkillers could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|E

During 2005, Helena gained nationwide notice as the hometown of singer Bo Bice, who was a finalist on the popular Fox program American Idol.|$|E
25|$|Batsmen <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> {{from the}} {{analysis}} of Hawk-Eye, as a record can be brought up of the deliveries batsmen scored from. These are often shown as a 2-D silhouetted figure of a batsmen and colour-coded dots of the balls faced by the batsman. Information such as the exact spot where the ball pitches or speed of the ball from the bowler's hand (to gauge batsman reaction time) can also help in post-match analysis.|$|E
