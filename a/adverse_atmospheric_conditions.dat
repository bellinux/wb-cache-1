5|$|Typhoon Longwang, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, was the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone to impact China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season. Longwang was first identified as a tropical depression on September25 north of the Mariana Islands. Moving along a general westward track, the system quickly intensified and reached typhoon status on September27. After reaching Category4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, <b>adverse</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> along with internal structural changes resulted in temporary weakening. The structural change culminated in Longwang becoming an annular typhoon and prompted re-intensification. The storm attained peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and a pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg) on October1 as it approached Taiwan. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island and further structural changes caused some weakening before the typhoon made landfall near Hualien City early on October2. Crossing the island in six hours, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait before moving onshore again later that day, this time in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. Once over mainland China, the storm quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated late on October3.|$|E
25|$|Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, {{formerly}} known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen, was a relatively weak tropical cyclone that caused loss of life across six countries in Southern and Southeastern Asia. Originating from an {{area of low pressure}} over the southern Bay of Bengal in early May 2013, Viyaru slowly consolidated into a depression on May10. The depression gained forward momentum and attained gale-force winds on May11 and was designated as Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, the first named storm of the season. Owing to <b>adverse</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> the depression struggled to maintain organized convection as it moved closer to eastern India. On May14, the exposed circulation of Viyaru turned northeastward. The following day, conditions again allowed for the storm to intensify. Early on May16, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a barometric pressure of 990mbar (hPa; 29.23inHg). Shortly thereafter Viyaru made landfall near Chittagong, Bangladesh. On May17, it moved over the eastern Indian state of Nagaland.|$|E

500|$|Upon peaking in intensity, Otto {{had become}} fully {{embedded}} within the deep-layered flow to its southwest. Racing northeastward, the hurricane entered {{an area of}} progressively cooler waters and <b>adverse</b> upper <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> which eroded its cloud pattern and disrupted the circulation. With maximum winds dropping below 70mph (110km/h), Otto {{was reduced to a}} tropical storm late on October9. Convective activity came to a near halt due to relentless wind shear and a [...] lack of tropical moisture, leading specialists to conclude the storm was entering an extratropical transition. The next day, the cool dry air infiltrated the weak warm core, and Otto began to develop frontal banding features. With these characteristics, Otto became an extratropical cyclone on October10, and the NHC discontinued advisories on the storm. The post-tropical system decelerated near the Azores over the next week, where it eventually degenerated into a remnant low that recurved sharply southeastward, before completely dissipating west of Morocco on October18.|$|R

40|$|A problem exists when {{applying}} {{a set of}} ground training signatures determined under one <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> to the same area under another <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition.</b> Sometimes the training signatures need to be adapted to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> of the subject area before classification. Other times the radiance measurements of an area with variable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> need to be adjusted to a common <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> before classification. In order to describe {{the effects of the}} atmosphere on the ground-reflected radiance measured by the LANDSAT- 1 satellite, a radiative transfer model was developed. The model is a combination of a doubling I model, which describes the effects of molecular and aerosol scattering in the atmosphere, and a scaling-approximation absorption model which takes into account the gaseous absorption due to oxygen, ozone and water vapor in the LANDSAT- 1 spectral region. The model indicates that atmospheric effects can be approximated by linear transforms. The transform shows that the atmosphere always degredes the albedo difference but not necessarily the color difference.

Knowledge of the extinction can allow to reconstruct the true image parameters, including energy and flux. Our final goal is to recover the source-intrinsic energy spectrum also for data affected by atmospheric extinction from aerosol layers, such as clouds. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|The blazar Mrk 501 {{is among}} the {{brightest}} X-ray and TeV sources in the sky, and among the few sources whose spectral energy distributions can be characterized by current instruments with relatively short observations (minutes to hours). In 2013, we organized an extensive multi-instrument campaign including Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, VERITAS, F-GAMMA, Swift, GASP-WEBT, and other groups and instruments which provided the most detailed temporal and energy coverage on Mrk 501 to date. This campaign included, for the first time, observations with the Nuclear Stereoscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), a satellite mission launched in 2012. NuSTAR provides unprecedented sensitivity in the hard X-ray range 3 - 79 keV, which, together with very high energy (VHE; > 100 GeV) observations, is crucial to probe the highest energy electrons in Mrk 501. The campaign covered a few day long flaring activity in July 2013 which could be studied with strictly simultaneous NuSTAR and MAGIC observations. A large fraction of the MAGIC data during this activity was affected by hazy atmospheric conditions, due to a sand layer from the Saharan desert. These data would have been removed in any standard Cherenkov Telescope data analysis. MAGIC has developed a technique to correct for <b>adverse</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> making use of information from the LIDAR facility at the MAGIC site, and applies an event-by-event correction to recover data affected by adverse weather conditions. This {{is the first time}} that LIDAR information has been used to produce a physics result with Cherenkov Telescope data taken during <b>adverse</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> and hence sets a precedent for current and future ground-based gamma-ray instruments.
