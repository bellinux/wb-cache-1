[...] Wherever he travelled, Jones drew huge crowds, but inwardly he was depressed. [...] He felt the crowds were only there to see the exotic Indian Kahkewāquonāby and his native costume, and did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> the work he had put into becoming a good Christian. [...] Despite his misgivings about the trip, he raised £1000, about two thirds of that total in Scotland, and one third in England. On August 4, 1845 in Edinburgh Jones was photographed by Robert Adamson and David Octavius Hill. [...] These were the first photographs taken of a North American Indian.|$|E
500|$|Despite Whedon's {{claim that}} the fourth season is a ‘final statement' for Connor, the {{character}} returns for a couple guests appearances in the fifth. This season sees a big development with a [...] "well-adjusted" [...] Connor and the long-due reconciliation of father and son; Connor is able to accept and <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> Angel did for him after his memories return. Minear and Bell were open to and had mentioned the possibility of character's return to Kartheiser {{at the end of}} season four. But following his return, Kartheiser isn't sure if the re-appearance was not only due to the necessity of tying up loose ends after the series was reckoned to be canceled. Originally Kartheiser was asked to appear for one episode [...] "Origin" [...] but the crew and Kartheiser enjoyed working with revamped Connor so much that [...] "it became clear to [...] that he had to appear for the series finale".|$|E
500|$|At the 2010 Comic-Con, Welling {{stated that}} Rosenbaum {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Lex in the series and wanted to return in some degree for the show's final season, but {{that he needed to}} finalize the details. According to Welling, the series would tease early on that Lex would return with the introduction of bodies into which Lex could tap in order to heal himself later in life. After months of speculation, the actor finally agreed to appear in the finale. Rosenbaum explained that his return was for the fans, stating, [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> of their passion, their relentlessness, and even their threats." [...] Had Rosenbaum not elected to return, Souders explained that Lex still would have played a part, but would have been more of [...] "a puppeteer behind the scenes" [...] {{and the fact that he}} was still living would have [...] "been a reveal at the end of the show", sans the dialogue.|$|E

500|$|Before Rosenbaum got the part, Martin Cummins {{auditioned for}} the role of Lex Luthor; Cummins would go on to play Dr. Garner, a neuro-scientist who {{experiments}} on Clark, in multiple episodes of Smallville spanning season two and three. Michael Rosenbaum is not the only actor to portray Lex on the show. There have been four other actors that have performed the role; Matthew Munn, Wayne Dalgish, Lucas Grabeel, and Connor Stanhope have all portrayed Lex Luthor as a child in various episodes throughout the series. Rosenbaum relished the opportunities he gets to show Lex's evil side, even if it is only for a few seconds in earlier seasons. Specifically, he delighted in the chance to [...] "go overboard", like he did in [...] "Hug" [...] where his character pulls out a machine gun and shoots everything in sight; to the actor, this gave the audience a glimpse into who Lex was becoming. To portray Lex's signature bald head, Rosenbaum had to go through more than just a regular head shaving. Not only was his head shaved every day, but he had to undergo hours of make-up treatments on his head, in various color combinations, so that his natural hairline did not show up on film. After seven seasons of portraying Lex Luthor on Smallville, Michael Rosenbaum decided to move on with his acting career, so he departed from the show. On February 11, 2011, Michael Ausiello reported that after the back and forth speculation as to whether Rosenbaum would return to the series, the actor finally agreed to appear in the series finale. Rosenbaum expressed that his return for the final episode was for the fans, stating, [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> of their passion, their relentlessness, and even their threats." ...|$|E

The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when I do have something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts with you at length and tell you openly how I feel.

2500|$|The {{film was}} previewed to French film {{distributors}} at the Palais Rochechouarton on 25 April 1934. The screening was disastrous and Gaumont {{took control of}} the film. Jean Pascal called the original cut [...] "a confused, incoherent, willfully absurd, long, dull, commercially worthless film." [...] However, Élie Faure said that he was reminded of the painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and praised [...] "these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line. And perhaps it was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration — classical, in a word — that made me <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> the more pleasure of savoring the very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism." ...|$|E

[...] Since that time, Kuhl has become more public and has been issuing more public statements and granting interviews to local radio station WLEA, primarily about the Massa situation. He was considering entering the special election for the vacant seat, but passed on it, endorsing former Corning mayor Tom Reed.|$|E

He continued; 'the line [...] "I've got friends who have lost their fathers and they're much stronger men than me" [...] refers mainly to Chris (Pennells, guitar), Jamie (manager) and my dear friend David Rice who have lost family members and yet still find a smile and <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> the upsides of life'. [...] "Little White Lies" [...] is about dishonesty. The song 'covers the way that lies eat away at my brain and cause me to almost lose my mind, yet I still keep making mistakes and bad decisions', according to James. He revealed little about the background of [...] "Leeches", saying only that 'Leeches is about something terrible and unspeakable that happened to someone who once made me very happy'. Speaking about [...] "Anemophobia", he said; 'the title of this song means a fear of wind, which I have, but the song on the whole though is about anxiety. ...This song was written when I was at my lowest point, I genuinely believed I was dying. ...The song is also about how lost I felt and still feel and how most days I don't feel like myself any more'.

2500|$|When Owen's own {{anonymous}} {{review of}} the Origin appeared in the April Edinburgh Review he praised himself and his own axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things, and showed his anger at {{what he saw as}} Darwin's caricature of the creationist position and ignoring Owen's pre-eminence. To him, new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection. As well as attacking Darwin's [...] "disciples" [...] Hooker and Huxley, he thought that the book symbolised the sort of [...] "abuse of science to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation." [...] Darwin had Huxley and Hooker staying with him when he read it, and he wrote telling Lyell that it was [...] "extremely malignant, clever & I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, & very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to <b>appreciate</b> <b>all</b> the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.– It scandalously misrepresents many parts..... It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me." [...] He commented to Henslow that [...] "Owen is indeed very spiteful. He misrepresents & alters what I say very unfairly..... The Londoners says he is mad with envy because my book has been talked about: what a strange man to be envious of a naturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior!" ...|$|E
