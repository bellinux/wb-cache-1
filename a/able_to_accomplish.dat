In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize the Soviet economy. After initial success in creating economic growth, hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical economic reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and economic growth began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E

The task of an application programmer is limited to specify the agenda, the finite state machine of the agent, and the strategies associated with each state. Bond agents can be!:ipecified using an agent definition langllage called blueprint. Agents are assembled during runtime by a factory object on the request of a beneficiary object. Bond also provides a large database of ready-made strategies, so in typical cases a Bond agent can be assembled without programming. ...|$|R
