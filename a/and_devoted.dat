5|$|After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bahá'u'lláh {{named his}} son `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, {{successor}} and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, and the appointment was readily accepted by almost all Bahá'ís, since the appointment was written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable <b>and</b> <b>devoted</b> assistant. However, the appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bahá was {{a cause of}} jealousy within Bahá'u'lláh's family. Bahá'u'lláh had also stated that another {{one of his sons}} Mírzá Muhammad `Alí was to be subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí, however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí's actions, however, were rejected by the majority of the Bahá'ís. Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.|$|E

5|$|Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, {{probably}} of mushroom poisoning. He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal <b>and</b> <b>devoted</b> to their new sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Garfield {{during this}} time {{purchased}} the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed Lawnfield, and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, <b>and</b> <b>devoted</b> his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, Allen G. Thurman. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield {{was elected to the}} Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.|$|E
