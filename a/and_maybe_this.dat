500|$|Maybe This Christmas is {{the first}} in a series of three {{consecutive}} holiday compilation albums released through Nettwerk. Maybe This Christmas Too? <b>and</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Tree were released in October 2003 and October 2004, respectively. The series was named by Ron Sexsmith, who contributed the title track to the compilation. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of each album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Maybe This Christmas contains thirteen [...] "rock-oriented" [...] tracks recorded by various artists. Most of the tracks exclusive to the album were recorded just a few months prior to its release. Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson dubbed the compilation an [...] "album suited for those twenty-somethings searching for [...] not-so-typical Christmas collection." [...] The cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the [...] "illustrated, wide-mouth monkey".|$|E
2500|$|On July 28, 2015, Tulowitzki {{was traded}} along with {{teammate}} LaTroy Hawkins to the Toronto Blue Jays {{in exchange for}} José Reyes, Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro, and Jesus Tinoco. Upon being informed of the trade {{during the middle of}} the ninth inning of a game at the Chicago Cubs, as Blue Jays and Rockies management had kept negotiations secret from the media, Tulowitzki reportedly yelled at Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich and vowed never to speak to him or other members of the Rockies front office. Tulowitzki expressed mixed emotions about the trade, but stated [...] "I get the chance to play for a contender, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> will revive my career a little bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 4 Nagin {{appeared}} {{before an audience}} of New Orleans evacuees at an event organized by the NAACP, where he made the statement that [...] "there was {{all this talk about}} this being an opportunity to change New Orleans forever and maybe everybody shouldn’t come back, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> is an opportunity to kind of change New Orleans and go back to what it used to be. I have 23 candidates running for mayor and very few of them look like us. [...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift in a city that was over two-thirds black before Katrina.|$|E
5|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? is {{a holiday}} {{compilation}} album released in October 2003 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs. The compilation {{served as a}} sequel to <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas (2002) <b>and</b> preceded <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Tree (2004). A portion of the proceeds from the album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Critical reception of the compilation, which failed to chart in any nation, was mixed.|$|R
2500|$|The revolutionary {{forces had}} {{occupied}} most of Tokyo, and Edo Castle {{and the majority}} of the Tokugawa troops had already surrendered, however one band of shogunate soldiers barricaded itself in Ueno with the intention to resist. About 2000 men strong, it was composed of members of the Shōgitai, a military unit of former Tokugawa retainers. They held the Kan'ei-ji's abbot in hostage, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> for <b>this</b> reason the Satsuma and Chōshū revolutionaries didn't attack immediately.|$|R
2500|$|Ted {{was a man}} of moods, often {{caught up}} in theories, keen when the action was hot, {{seemingly}} uninterested when the game was dull...a big-time player, one who responded to atmosphere, liked action and enjoyed the chase <b>and</b> gamble. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> was the reason he was drawn to horse racing; a dull day stalking the covers might be enlivened for him by thoughts of how his money was faring on the 3:15 at Ascot or Goodwood.|$|R

5000|$|Of the upset result, former three-time French Open {{champion}} Mats Wilander {{stated that}} [...] "Everybody's {{in a state}} of shock, I would think. At some point, Nadal was going to lose. But nobody expected it to happen today, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> not <b>this</b> year. Now it's a matter of: There's a tournament to be won."

"Trouble {{with a lot}} {{of folks}} is: they're so blame material; they don't see the spiritual and mental side of American supremacy; they think that inventions like the {{telephone}} and the areoplane and wireless--no, that was a Wop invention, but anyway: they think these mechanical improvements are all that we stand for; whereas to a real thinker, he sees that spiritual and, uh, dominating movements like Efficiency, and Rotarianism, and Prohibition, and Democracy are what compose our deepest and truest wealth. <b>And</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> new principle in education-at-home may be another--may be another factor.

60|$|My {{companion}} explained {{quite frankly}} to the doorkeeper {{that it did}} not matter what he said, {{she was not going to}} take any notice of him. He did not look a talkative man at any time, <b>and,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>this</b> announcement further discouraged him. In any case, he made no attempt to answer. All he did was to stand in the centre of the doorway with a far-away look in his eyes. The doorway was some four feet wide: he was about three feet six across, and weighed about twenty stone. As I explained, I was busy buying a programme, and when I returned my friend had her hat in her hand, and was digging pins into it: I think she was trying to make believe it was the heart of the doorkeeper. She did not want to listen to the opera, she wanted to talk all the time about that doorkeeper, but the people round us would not even let her do that.|$|E
6000|$|ON {{the evening}} of Fan's visit, Polly sat down before her fire with a {{resolute}} and thoughtful aspect. She pulled her hair down, turned her skirt back, put {{her feet on the}} fender, and took Puttel into her lap, all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled. Polly did not soliloquize aloud, as heroines on the stage and in books have a way of doing, but the conversation she held with herself was very much like this: [...] "I 'm afraid there is something in it. I 've tried to think it 's nothing but vanity or imagination, yet I can't help seeing a difference, and feeling as if I ought not to pretend that I don't. I know it 's considered proper for girls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how much mischief is done. But I don't think it 's doing as we 'd be done by, and it seems a great deal more honest to show a man that you don't love him before he has entirely lost his heart. The girls laughed at me when I said so, and they declared {{that it would be a}} very improper thing to do, but I 've observed that they don't hesitate to snub 'ineligible parties,' as they call poor, very young, or unpopular men. It 's all right then, but when a nice person comes it 's part of the fun to let him go on to the very end, whether the girls care for him or not. The more proposals, the more credit. Fan says Trix always asks when she comes home after the summer excursions, 'How many birds have you bagged?' as if men were partridges. What wicked creatures we are! some of us at least. I wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us? Mother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays, but some girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would manage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness. I 'm afraid I 've got a spice of it, and if I had the chance, should be as bad as any of them. I 've tried it and liked it, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> is the consequence of that night's fun." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{hearing was}} set for Sept. 24, 2014 at the Federal {{courthouse}} in Detroit, Michigan to hear arguments on issuance of {{a temporary restraining order}} to require the State of Michigan to reprint general election ballots. Judge Friedman turned down the requested order on the grounds the motion was barred by Laches, to not disrupt the orderly election process, he did not rule on the merits of the case. Judge Friedman further stated that [...] "there seemed to be an issue here" [...] <b>and</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> is an issue [...] "that state lawmakers should take up" [...] to resolve.|$|R
5000|$|Stravaganzza {{became a}} {{consolidated}} band in 2003. The first precursor to Stravaganzza is {{without a doubt}} the band that Pepe Herrero (guitar) and Leo Jiménez (vocals) founded in 1993 and which later would be joined by Patricio Babasasa as a drummer: Krysálida, with an instrumental group {{just the same as}} in Stravaganzza (including violin and keyboards), but adding a second vocalist who sang the guttural parts. With that lineup they had already made a similar style to Stravaganzza, with obscure parts, orchestral passages but perhaps a bit more complex <b>and</b> anti-commercial; <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> was the cause of it not being very understood and accepted, which would lead to it breaking up about four years later.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, the bassist in {{the group}} Moostop {{announced}} his desire to leave the group. Vocalist Don Matsuo stated that [...] "I wasn’t really surprised, <b>and</b> knew that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> would happen one day, but I still wasn’t happy about his decision." [...] The group did a tour and recorded a tour-only EP together. During this tour, the groups' drummer Pitt also announced his departure. Don Matuso and his wife Matta began focus on a new group called The Randolf after this tour.|$|R

50|$|In the British Isles, this {{dragonfly}} is very locally {{distributed in}} the lowlands, but more widespread in the north-west and Ireland.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine Pestalozzi's concept of "individual situation" (Individuallage), which is {{regarded}} to have played an important part in the constitution and development of his thought (educational <b>and</b> socio-political). <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> helps us to clarify the problems concerning the social character of his educational thought. In this paper we begin with the critical examination of the conception in "The Evening Hour of a Hermit" (part I), followed by that of later works on elementary education (part II). 'Individual situation' received some changes under the influence of the French Revolution to Helvetia in the following points; connection between general education and professional education, idea of individuality', and spirit of moral independence. In the last part (III) the fundamental meaning of the concept to his educational theory is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{companion}} article to my papers on Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and character formulae for the Lie superalgebras gl(m|n) (much revised!) and q(n).

50|$|FHM India {{recently}} {{changed its}} focus from some random celebrity shoot to concept based celebrity shoot <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> move {{gave them an}} edge over its competitor which is clearly visible on Apple Store and Google Play Store where they have approximately 5,00,000+ downloads {{which is more than}} 20 times as compare to their competitors.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{typically}} unusual and subtle murder mystery, presented within Marsh's characteristic comedy of manners, the novel gives a fine description of Rome's sights, smells and sounds, {{and of its}} multi-layered architecture and history, seen {{from the perspective of}} an exclusive group of English-speaking tourists. There is also a description of the 1968 student demonstrations, which Marsh herself witnessed briefly in Paris, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> radicalism influenced this book's view of the aristocracy (of whom Marsh has sometimes been accused of a snobbishly uncritical over-fondness). The decadent Lady Sonia Braceley and her nephew The Hon. Kenneth Dorne are depicted with relish and distaste as 'la dolce vita' at its most worthless, and given short shrift by Roderick Alleyn.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} about why Yoshikubo might {{have chosen to}} die by walking into the bush around Yellowknife. Simon Hatcher, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} the University of Ottawa, said that most long wilderness sojourns are a form of temporary suicide, from which people return feeling better. [...] "People who are suicidal can have this fantasy where they can have a temporary escape—a temporary suicide," [...] he told the National Post. [...] "And maybe that way they will stand out, and somebody will come along <b>and</b> save them. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> was some form of this woman testing fate." ...|$|R

40|$|Moving {{learning}} analytics {{from the research}} labs to the classrooms and lecture halls requires data sharing.

This paper analyses a corpus of more than 200 questions gathered by a European learning analytics support action and explores how these questions could be used to understand the problem space of data sharing and the solution space to be carved out by research and development within this emerging field of learning technologies.

5000|$|It's {{partly a}} {{question}} of point-of-view. The book is entirely {{in the voice of}} the 14-year-old girl. That sort of tips the feeling of it over a certain way. I think book is much funnier than the movie was so I think, unfortunately, they lost a lot of humor in both the situations and in her voice. It also ends differently than the movie did. You see the main character - the little girl - 25 years later when she's an adult. Another way in which it's a little bit different from the movie - <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> is just because of the time the movie was made - is that it's a lot tougher and more violent than the movie reflects.
