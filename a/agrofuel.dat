40|$|The {{production}} of <b>agrofuel</b> crops {{is believed to}} be playing a decisive role in the so-called "land rush," the international scramble for arable land in developing and emerging countries. Reports of an alarming wave of land acquisitions due to "agrofuels hype" initiated by <b>agrofuel</b> investors have made headlines in recent years. The potential merits and dangers of <b>agrofuel</b> production are the subject of heavy debate, with food-security concerns and environmental impacts fueling the controversy. Analysis Based on data from the Land Matrix Global Observatory, our analysis assesses the role of <b>agrofuel</b> production in the "rush for land" and sheds light on the often-nontransparent investment process of <b>agrofuel</b> projects. We find that these projects account for an important share of the global demand for land. However, the "agrofuels hype" is over. Land deals with the intention of cultivating <b>agrofuel</b> crops are particularly prone to failure, especially early on in the projects. We expect that the investors that have survived this first period of investments are here to stay, and that "cowboy investors" have been turned off by difficult investment environments in low- and middle-income countries. <b>Agrofuel</b> production {{is one of the main}} drivers of the global rush for land. Twentythree percent of the concluded transnational deals currently recorded in the Land Matrix include plants intended for <b>agrofuel</b> production. Sub-Saharan Africa appears to be the most heavily favored region for <b>agrofuel</b> investments. European investors top the rankings of investor countries for <b>agrofuel</b> projects. <b>Agrofuel</b> crops require huge initial investments and take several years to yield returns.

40|$|In the United States, government-mandated {{growth in}} the {{production}} of crops dedicated to biofuel (agrofuels) is predicted to increase the demands on existing agricultural lands, potentially threatening the persistence of populations of grassland birds they support. We review recently published literature and datasets to (1) examine the ability of alternative <b>agrofuel</b> crops and their management regimes to provide habitat for grassland birds, (2) determine how crop placement in agricultural landscapes and agrofuel-related land-use change will affect grassland birds, and (3) identify critical research and policy-development needs associated with <b>agrofuel</b> production. We find that native perennial plants proposed as feedstock for <b>agrofuel</b> (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum, and mixed grass–forb prairie) have considerable potential to provide new habitat {{to a wide range of}} grassland birds, including rare and threatened species. However, industrialization of <b>agrofuel</b> production that maximizes biomass, homogenizes vegetation structure, and results in the cultivation of small fields within largely forested landscapes is likely to reduce species richness and/or abundance of grassland-dependent birds. Realizing the potential benefits of <b>agrofuel</b> production for grassland birds’ conservation will require the development of new policies that encourage agricultural practices specifically targeting the needs of grassland specialists.

40|$|First paragraph: This article {{considers}} {{the potential for}} strategic and selective use of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to regulate, and potentially curb, the expansion of food-based agrofuels. Since 2008, a global <b>agrofuel</b> complex has emerged that is characterized by government-led mandates and investment for food-based <b>agrofuel</b> production and trade. The majority of world <b>agrofuel</b> production utilizes basic foodstuffs-sugar, corn/maize, soy and palm oil-thus generating competition between food/feed and fuel end-uses. This competition is strongly linked to food price volatility, food insecurity and land grabbing on a global-scale. Food-based <b>agrofuel</b> production is projected to increase significantly over the next decade, with international trade of agrofuels growing in tandem due to rising global demand. Despite well-documented social and ecological consequences associated with food-based agrofuels, producing and consuming states demonstrate a lack of political will to curb future <b>agrofuel</b> expansion and, in particular, continue to resist demands by global civil society and other social groups for global agrofuels regulation. In a global political economic context best characterized by a global governance gap for agrofuels, I consider the prospects and challenges of strategic and selective application of WTO rules to regulate food-based agrofuels. Also considered is the legitimacy and efficacy of the WTO to fill the existing global governance gap for agrofuels, and the potential of alternative global governance institutions to play this role...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} the global expansion of <b>agrofuels</b> feedstock production {{from a political}} economy perspective. It considers and dismisses the environmental and pro-poor developmental justifications attached to <b>agrofuels.</b> To local populations and direct producers, the specific destination of the crop as fuel, food, cosmetics or other final uses in faraway places is probably of less interest than the forms of (direct or indirect) appropriation of their land and the forms of their insertion or exclusion as producers in global commodity chains. Global demand for both <b>agrofuels</b> and food is stimulating new forms (or the resurgence of old forms) of corporate land grabbing and expropriation, and of incorporation of smallholders in contracted production. Drawing both on recent studies on <b>agrofuels</b> expansion and on the political economy literature on agrarian transition and capitalism in agriculture, this article raises the question whether 'agrofuels capitalism' is in any way essentially different from other forms of capitalist agrarian monocrop production, and in turn whether the agrarian transitions involved require new tools of analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{expansion}} of <b>agrofuel</b> crops challenges us to rethink policies, territories, human agency, and the paradigms {{used to explain}} them. in Brazil, policies supporting the {{expansion of}} <b>agrofuel</b> crops and the intensification of <b>agrofuel</b> production are reorganising rural land use and undermining some forms {{of participation in the}} capitalist and family modes of production. To reflect on this new reality, we study peasant movement reactions, proposals, and territorial disputes with agribusiness. Using the Pontal do Paranapanema region of São Paulo state as a case in point, the paper analyses territorial disputes between expanding sugarcane plantations and agrarian reform settlements as well as biodiesel production projects developed by the Landless Workers Movement (MST) and the Western São Paulo Federation of Settlement and Family Farmer Associations (FAAFOP). It also analyses the <b>agrofuel</b> policies of other peasant organisations, including Via Campesina. the production of agrofuels has changed the processes of land acquisition and use by both agribusiness and the peasantry, provoking new insights into the nature of territorial conflicts and thereby stimulating the need to revise perspectives on the agrarian question in Brazil.

The micro-lifecycle is the one most often quoted by industry analysts who measure the fossil fuel investments but ignore the macro-impacts of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accelerating deforestation, the loss of ecosystem functions and ultimately the triggering of irreversible climate feedbacks. These macroimpacts are so expansive and impossible to assess {{that there can be no}} accurate figure for <b>agrofuel</b> LCAs making <b>agrofuel</b> standards and certification impossible and irrelevant.
