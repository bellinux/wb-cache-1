5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> impulse {{is carried}} down the axon (the long {{projection}} of <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} proximal Cech {{nerves and}} Cech complexes, restricted to finite, bounded regions $K$ of the Euclidean plane. <b>A</b> Cech <b>nerve</b> is <b>a</b> collection of intersecting balls. A Cech complex is <b>a</b> collection of <b>nerves</b> that cover $K$. Cech nerves are proximal, provided the nerves {{are close to}} each other, either spatially or descriptively. <b>A</b> Cech <b>nerve</b> has <b>an</b> advantage over the usual Alexandroff nerve, since we need only identify the center and fixed radius of each ball in <b>a</b> Cech <b>nerve</b> instead of identifying the three vertices of intersecting filled triangles (2 -simplexes) in <b>an</b> Alexandroff <b>nerve.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Cech <b>nerves</b> more easily cover $K$ and facilitate approximation of the shapes of irregular finite, bounded planar regions.

5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
5|$|Lepidoptera {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which {{consist of a}} large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> leading to the brain. Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E

50|$|Mono{{neuropathy}} {{is a type}} of neuropathy {{that only}} affects <b>a</b> single <b>nerve.</b> Diagnostically, it is important to distinguish it from polyneuropathy because when <b>a</b> single <b>nerve</b> is affected, it {{is more likely to be}} due to localized trauma or infection.|$|R
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The large {{surface area}} and vascularization of the crest also {{suggests}} a thermoregulatory function. The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed that there was <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> connection between the crest and the brain, so that the latter could be cooled by the former. The next people to publish a related idea were Maryanska and Osmólska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation. In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why {{this could be a}} causing factor for the evolution of the crest.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer layer}} of the {{epidermis}} (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; cells that secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the outer layer also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion. The inner {{layer of the}} epidermis contains <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.|$|E
40|$|Nerve reconstructions are the {{preferred}} technique for short-standing facial paralysis, most commonly using the contralateral facial nerve or ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve. The hypoglossal <b>nerve</b> provides <b>a</b> strong motor signal, whereas the signal of <b>a</b> cross-face <b>nerve</b> graft is weaker but spontaneous. Spontaneity in facial expression {{is believed to}} be important for psychological wellbeing. Therefore, {{a combination of the two}} procedures incorporates the best of both: a strong motor signal and a spontaneous smile. This study aimed to objectify this expected benefit. Of the 20 patients who received <b>a</b> hypoglossal-facial <b>nerve</b> anastomosis from 1995 to 2015 in our institutions, 12 patients were included in this study, 5 with and 7 without <b>a</b> cross-face <b>nerve</b> graft. The outcomes were compared using photographs, disease-specific quality of life (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) scale), a self-reported synkinesis scale (Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire) and the presence of a spontaneous smile. Significant differences were found in preoperative excursion of the affected side of the mouth and the change in excursion. Median Total FaCE scores were considerably larger (18. 3 points) for patients who underwent the combined procedure. A spontaneous smile was observed both with (n = 2) and without (n = 1) <b>a</b> cross-face <b>nerve</b> graft. The addition of <b>a</b> cross-face <b>nerve</b> graft to <b>a</b> hypoglossalefacial <b>nerve</b> anastomosis resulted in a positive trend in disease-specific quality of life.

5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on <b>a</b> <b>nerve</b> root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
