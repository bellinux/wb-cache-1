The Guardian described it as [...] "a cacophonous rhythmic throb which drew on post punk, industrial, doom metal, NYC avant minimalism and the blues; a sound which was matched by Gira's often nihilistic, <b>anti-natalist</b> and existential lyrical concerns ... delivered in a stentorian and messianic manner." [...] It was an important contribution to both industrial music and noise rock and influenced the emergence of grindcore (inspiring also the use of [...] "grind" [...] in musical context) and sludge metal. Later in the 1980s, Swans' music began to incorporate more melodic and intricate elements, especially since Jarboe's debut as a songwriter on 1987's Children of God. While generally maintaining much dissonance, the band's subsequent work further ventured into genres such as post-punk, gothic rock, neofolk, psychedelic rock and art rock. Their final album before breaking up, 1996's Soundtracks for the Blind, is a double album which emphasizes atmosphere, a contribution to the post-rock, drone and dark ambient genres. Since re-forming in 2010, Swans have continued to be associated with post-rock and drone music as well as noise rock. Their last three double albums, which have brought them widespread critical acclaim, often feature long songs that develop complex soundscapes.|$|E

50|$|The {{birth rate}} {{is an issue}} of concern and policy for {{national}} governments. Some (including those of Italy and Malaysia) seek to increase the birth rate with financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate (for example, China's one-child policy which was in effect from 1978 to 2015). Policies to increase the crude birth rate are known as pro-natalist policies, and policies to reduce the crude birth rate are known as <b>anti-natalist</b> policies. Measures such as improved information on birth control and its availability have achieved similar results in countries such as Iran.|$|E

Singapore pays $3,000 for the first child, $9,000 in cash and savings for the second; and up to $18,000 each for the third and fourth.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{premise of}} this paper that {{television}} reflects a pro-natalist bias in its promotion of the traditional female role in society, and that such bias is evident in both commercial advertisements {{as well as in}} dramatic presentations particularly on daytime television. Those who are opposed to a pro-natalist point of view will find it virtually impossible to air their opposition effectively. At best <b>anti-natalist</b> groups may be able to garner only meager financial resources to air spot commercials, but this is hardly adequate to combat the subtle onslaught of the opposition. Suggestions have been made that pro-natalist attitudes be countered by means of the Federal Communications Commission 2 ̆ 7 s Fairness Doctrine which might possibly enable <b>anti-natalist</b> groups {{to gain access to the}} airwaves. This paper will examine present television attitudes as well as the history and status of the Fairness Doctrine in an attempt to evaluate the availability of this doctrine as a tool for those interested in population control...|$|E
40|$|The Non-Identity Problem (the NIP) {{raises a}} series of {{problems}} to the morality of procreation. The NIP, I believe, highlights a fundamental problem concerning the justifiability of procreation. In chapter 1, I introduce the NIP and show that {{the logic of the}} NIP does not rule out the <b>anti-natalist</b> claim. Moreover, there are reasons, which are independent of its capacity to solve the NIP, to accept the <b>anti-natalist</b> claim. However, the <b>anti-natalist</b> claim poses a serious justificatory challenge to the permissibility of procreation. To see whether we can restore the permissibility of procreation, I examine the impersonal pro-natalist claim in chapter 2 and argue that there is not only no good reason to believe that whatever makes life worth living gives us an impersonal reason to procreate but good reason not to believe that. In chapter 3, I examine the justifications for the right to procreate and argue that most promising ground – that is, parenting interest – fails to establish a moral right to procreate. Therefore, the justification of procreation is in trouble, at least, at the individual level because there is a reason against procreation out of concern for possible people and no impersonal reason to procreate and the moral significance of parenting interests fails to justify imposing the harm of coming into existence. This is, nevertheless, a somewhat moderate conclusion because it does not defend that procreation is all-things-considered wrong. More works need to be done to show why procreation is morally permissible (or impermissible) ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{studies the}} {{interface}} {{in poor countries}} of population growth, rural poverty, and deterioration of the local natural-resource base, a subject that has been much neglected by modern demographers and development economists. The motivations for procreation in rural communities of the poorest {{regions of the world}} are analyzed, and recent work on the relevance of gender relationships to such motivations is summarized. Four potentially significant social externalities associated with fertility behavior and use of the local natural-resource base are identified. Three are shown to be pronatalist in their effects, while the fourth is shown to be ambiguous, in that it can be either pro- or <b>anti-natalist.</b> It is shown that one of the externalities may even provide an invidious link between fertility decisions {{and the use of the}} local natural-resource base. The fourth type of externality is used to develop a theory of fertility transitions in the contemporary world. The theory views such transitions as disequilibrium phenomena. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a shorter {{fecundity}} horizon for females (a biological constraint) leads to age and educational disparities between husbands and wives. Empirical support {{is based on}} data from a natural experiment commencing before and ending after China's 1980 one-child law. The results indicate that fertility in China declined by about 1. 2 - 1. 4 births per woman as a result of China's <b>anti-natalist</b> policies. Concomitantly spousal age and educational differences narrowed by approximately 0. 5 - 1. 0 and 1. 0 - 1. 6 years respectively. These decreases in the typical husband's age and educational advantages are important in explaining the division of labor in the home, often given as a cause for the gender wage gap. Indeed, as fertility declined, which has been the historical trend in most developed countries, husband-wife age and educational differences diminished leading to less division of labor in the home and a smaller gender wage disparity. Unlike other models of division of labor in the home which rely on innately endogenous factors, this paper's theory is based on an exogenous biological constraint...|$|E
40|$|For Malian women, {{migration}} from West Africa to France has disrupted widely shared understandings {{of marriage and}} reproduction. In response to restrictive immigration policies, men and women routinely confront the challenges of polygamy, public disapproval of high fertility, and biomedical messages promoting contraception. Although many Malians continue to be strongly pronatalist, within a family, spouses may experience contradictory pressures and objectives regarding reproduction, particularly in polygamous marriages. Because {{women are more likely}} than men to interact with nurses and doctors in the context of maternity and child health care visits, they are systematically confronted by encouragement to contracept. French population policy is contradictory in this regard, as it has been strongly pronatalist throughout the 20 th century, yet is equally strongly <b>anti-natalist</b> with regard to immigrant populations. Recent anti-immigrant policies such as the Pasqua law prohibiting polygamy have emerged as influences shaping men's and women's contested reproductive goals. Men tend to oppose contraception, citing Islamic doctrine while women increasingly justify contraceptive use in response to government policies and biomedical encouragement. In contrast, polygamy also may generate pregnancy rivalries as wives strategize to enhance their reproductive careers and thus to retain immigrant status.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{demographic}} and development literature indicates that {{in a wide variety}} of settings, schooling of women is related to lower fertility and childhood mortality. The statistical relationship between female schooling and fertility or childhood mortality remains strong even after controlling for the factors which are likely to confound it (Jeffery and Basu, 1996). Against this backdrop, an apparent programme intervention in a country with an <b>anti-natalist</b> population policy would be to invest in enlarging the range and quality of female schooling. In fact, most developing countries, particularly those in South Asia, have already accepted women’s education as a source of fertility decline. Developing an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the schooling-fertility relationship would be useful in designing effective intervention strategies. Many researchers have attempted to explore the pathway of linkage between education of women and fertility. Firstly, improvement in female education is associated with a rise in her status, which is believed to lead to lower fertility (Mason, 1984, Cochrane, 1979). But, Jeffery and Basu (1996) have raised doubts about the constituents of the term “status”, as the two researchers have used it differently. Woman’s status has been described as her position in the society and expectations from her according to her position. It has also been linked to the prestige of wome...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{construction}} of maternal identity and female creativity in Natália Correia's iconoclastic 1968 novel A Madona. Departing from Correia's renowned defence of a philosophy of "matrismo" (maternalism or matriarchalism) as against "feminismo", I note that her highly rhetorical, personalized and performative account of "matrismo" was, at the same time, articulated in relation to a strongly <b>anti-natalist</b> stance that lent public support to abortion rights. I argue that Correia's aesthetics of "matrismo", relying heavily on a surrealist-influenced narrative aesthetic, worked rather to question than to reinforce gender and sex typologies, suggesting a shifting dynamic, interaction between the sexes, which does not readily cohere into the ideality of a socio-symbolic norm. In relation to the text of A Madona specifically, I draw on Butlerian theory to show that her representation of sexual difference and female reproductivity, through the Bildungs narrative of the protagonist Branca, {{takes the form of a}} progressively disjunctive "mis-mapping", deploying surrealist techniques such as "le hasard objectif" and the reiteration of Nietzschean image cycles from Greco-Roman and Egyptian myth. The result is a loosening of the "necessary" relation that binds sexual identity to the absolute symbolic law of genealogical continuity, so that sexuality itself in Correia's work, and the sexing of creative genius that it authorizes in much of her thinking, are revealed to be, in Judith Butler's term, largely phantasmatic...|$|E
40|$|Transnational {{public policy}} {{networks}} (TPPNs) continue to exert wide-ranging {{influence over the}} development of population control policy at the domestic/state level. It has therefore become vital to analyze the structural form of TPPN mobilization discourses that create new values, reinforce particularistic normative interests and recast old paradigms to make them hold across frontiers {{in an era of}} globalization phenomena. Two broad discourse categories suggest themselves upon close examination of TPPN behavior. These have arisen in the wake of empirical crises in the erstwhile dependency theory dominated approach to contextualizing international connections to domestic policy development. The first is based on a human development/’’quality of family life’ ’ platform, but only nominally, since it foundationally derives from a shaky coalition between an anti-liberal agenda and a reproductive rights logic. This <b>anti-natalist</b> camp competes with a pro-natalist movement boosted by new demographic shifts across Western Europe, STD epidemics in the developing world, and resultant accentuated convergences along the global north-south contour. My prediction is that as the polarization of transnational activity intensifies, domestic agencies will be constrained by their increasing dysfunctionality in addressing population-developmental issues. The individual citizen and her civil freedoms to tailor her sexual behaviour taking into consideration all relevant factors will end up the main casualties. In the South especially, notwithstanding increasing civil liberation across the private domain, reproductive freedoms will continue to suffer from organized apathy...|$|E
40|$|Since 1950, {{the changes}} in {{fertility}} behavior in the Thai population {{have proved to be}} very interesting. Between the years of 1950 to 1957, the government invoked a pro-natalist policy and created the Married organization where the fertility rate has increased in that period. In 1960, the government concerned about the increasing in fertility rate, which led to the introduction to the National Family Planning Program, under the Ministry of Public Health, which promoted the voluntary use of contraception. Since then the fertility pattern has entered controlled fertility". To date, fertility continues to decline and is currently below replacement level. The changes in fertility rates, and the shifts in government policy, require research into the causes of the factors influencing the total fertility rate (TFR). In this study, a Thai TFR model is constructed by using system dynamics modelling concept", to investigate TFR behavior, including the effects of government policy. This system dynamics model has been examined and analyzed, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} increase in fertility rates in 1950 s were caused by the government pro-natalist policy. On the other hand, the later decline in fertility was influenced by the intensity of the support for the government's <b>anti-natalist</b> policy (National Economic and Social Development Plan [NESDP], 1970). Finally, this research provides the policy recommendation, which aims to support child bearing cost. This policy leads couple to perceive the decline in cost, they will then prefer more children. However, the government should also focus on the promotion of population quality, ensure that all births are desirable and safe, mothers and babies are provided with quality services...|$|E
