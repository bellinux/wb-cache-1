5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

40|$|Elementary teacher {{education}} involves learning to teach science. Even in elementary school, teaching science is demanding work—teachers must orchestrate {{a complex set}} of teaching practices to support students’ science learning. This dissertation examines the application of Grossman and colleagues’ (2009) cross-professional learning framework, highlighting <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice in the form of simulated teaching experiences, to support prospective elementary teachers in learning to teach science. Specifically, <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice focused on investigation lessons or lesson portions were designed and incorporated into an undergraduate elementary science teaching methods course. Using qualitative research methods, I studied relationships between four prospective teachers’ <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice and their instructional approaches, ideas about, and confidence in teaching elementary science investigation lessons. I also examined prospective teachers’ perceptions of the utility <b>of</b> <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice in learning to teach elementary science. Data analyses indicate that <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice served several functions. Less-authentic yet highly-supported <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice provided opportunities to experience investigation lessons from teacher and student perspectives. Other <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice allowed teachers to focus on parts of science lessons in elementary classrooms. Full-length science lessons in elementary classrooms provided learning opportunities aligned with authentic daily teaching responsibilities. All <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice afforded opportunities to develop practice, ideas, and confidence. Prospective teachers’ reflections identified benefits and constraints of learning to teach by approximating practice. Considered individually and together, <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice informed and were informed by prospective teachers’ evolving ideas about and confidence for teaching investigation lessons. Curriculum materials and cooperating teachers also influenced prospective teachers’ instruction, ideas, and confidence. Findings support a theoretical model that positions <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice, ideas about investigation lessons, confidence for science teaching, and other individually-relevant factors as highly interrelated, dynamic constructs. This dissertation study shows that <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice supported prospective elementary teachers’ development of instructional approaches, ideas, and confidence for teaching investigation lessons earlier than anticipated: prior to student teaching. Additionally, study findings provide insights into theory and practice of elementary science {{teacher education}}, and teacher education more broadly. Thus, this dissertation provides evidence that <b>approximations</b> <b>of</b> practice support the preparation of well-started beginning elementary science teachers...|$|R

Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E
