50|$|An alcohol-free bar, {{also known}} as a dry bar, is a bar that does not serve {{alcoholic}} beverages. An alcohol-free bar can be a business establishment or located in a non-business environment or event, such as at a wedding. Alcohol-free bars typically serve non-alcoholic beverages, such as non-alcoholic cocktails known as mocktails, alcohol-free beer or low-alcohol beer, <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>wine,</b> juice, soft drinks and water. Various foods may also be served.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} Christian {{denominations}} also forbid {{the consumption of}} alcohol, including the Amish, Seventh-day Adventists, Mennonites (both Old Order and Conservative), Church of the Brethren members, and Christian Scientists. Many Christian groups, such as Methodists, Mormons, and Quakers, are often associated with teetotalism due to their traditionally strong support for temperance movements and prohibition. However, tenets forbidding the consumption of alcohol are variably practiced. In many Christian denominations, abstinence is not a religious requirement, but the tradition {{is strong enough to}} make ritual and recreational alcohol consumption a controversial issue among members. Members of the Salvation Army make a promise on joining the movement to observe lifelong abstinence from alcohol. The Catholic Church, Orthodox churches, and Anglicanism all require wine in their central religious rite of the eucharist, and while many Protestant churches often allow grape juice or <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>wine</b> in their communion services, only a few Protestants require a non-alcoholic beverage as official policy.

5000|$|The comic {{centers around}} an unnamed police officer whose partner is a {{specially}} trained police dog named Greg. The duo are professionals at catching criminals. One day, the cop and Greg spot a bomb, but they arrive {{too late to}} defuse it. The duo is critically injured by the bomb's explosion and are taken to the hospital. The doctor announces that Greg's body is dying and the Cop's head is dying. Fortunately, the nurse has a great idea: the surgical crew will cut off Greg's head and sew it on the Cop's body. The doctor accepts the idea and the hospital crew hold a big operation. The operation is successful and everyone calls the new dog/man hybrid [...] "Dog Man." [...] Dog Man catches criminals with his sensitive nose, hears crimes with his ears, and punches criminals with his fists. But Dog Man has one mortal fear: vacuum cleaners. Petey (of The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby 2), Rip Van Tinkle's former feline minion, sees Dog Man's weakness so he invents an evil vacuum robot. The vacuum robot steals all {{the money from the}} bank and Dog Man comes to stop it but the vacuum chases him. The robot chases Dog Man until he is cornered. Dog Man is certain he will die but fortunately, the vacuum robot, which is plugged in, unplugs, and shuts down. Dog Man then destroys the robot and follows the robot's cord, which leads to Petey's hideout and Dog Man arrests him. Dog Man celebrates his victory by drinking some <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>wine</b> with his fellow cops. This comic was then made into a book in 2016 with lots of other Dog Man comics, with a sequel planned to come out either that same year or in 2017.|$|E
40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} shows that phenol-rich beverages exert strong antioxidant activity. However, in vivo evidence has produced conflicting results. In the present study, we studied {{the impact of the}} ingestion of 300 mL of black and green tea, <b>alcohol-free</b> red <b>wine,</b> <b>alcohol-free</b> white <b>wine,</b> or water on plasma total antioxidant capacity in five healthy volunteers. Red wine has the highest content of phenolics (3. 63 Â± 0. 48 g QE/L), followed by green tea (2. 82 Â± 0. 07 g QE/L), black tea (1. 37 Â± 0. 15 g QE/L), and white wine (0. 31 Â± 0. 01 g QE/L). Plasma total antioxidant capacity values of subjects who drank green tea rose at 30 min (P < 0. 05). After black tea and red wine ingestion, the peaks were at 50 min (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01, respectively). No changes were observed in the control and white wine groups. Red wine and green tea were the most efficient in protecting low density lipoprotein from oxidation driven by peroxyl and ferril radicals, respectively. Phenol-rich beverages are a natural source of antioxidants; however, the phenolic content alone cannot be considered an index of their in vivo antioxidant activity. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Background. Myoglobinuric acute {{renal failure}} causes {{increased}} oxidative stress. Since ethanol upregulates renal antioxidant enzymes and wine polyphenols behave as antioxidants, we tested the hypothesis that red wine components would ameliorate the renal damage caused by rhabdomyolysis. Methods. Adult rats received water (control), <b>alcohol-free</b> red <b>wine,</b> ethanol 12. 5 % (v/v) or red wine for 10 weeks. Rhabdomyolysis was induced by glycerol injec-tion (50 %, 10 ml/kg, i. m.), and urine and blood sam-ples were collected 6 h later to measure renal function parameters, creatine kinase (CK) activity, free F 2 -isoprostanes and total antioxidant capacity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} ethyl alcohol and wine (red and white) on haemostatic {{parameters}} and experimental thrombosis were studied in rats; NO was evaluated {{as a possible}} mediator of these effects. We found that red wine (12 % alcohol) supplementation (8. 4 ± 0. 4 [*]ml[*]d− 1 in drinking water, for 10 days) induced a marked prolongation of ‘template' bleeding time (BT) (258 ± 13 vs 132 ± 13 [*]s in controls; P< 0. 001), a decrease in platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen (11. 6 ± 1. 0 vs 32. 2 ± 1. 3 %; P< 0. 01) {{and a reduction in}} thrombus weight (1. 45 ± 0. 33 vs 3. 27 ± 0. 39 mg; P< 0. 01). <b>Alcohol-free</b> red <b>wine</b> showed an effect similar to red wine. In contrast, neither ethyl alcohol (12 %) nor white wine (12 % alcohol) affected these systems. All these effects were also observed after red wine i. v. injection (1 [*]ml[*]kg− 1 of 1 [*]:[*] 4 dilution) 15 [*]min before the experiments. The effects of red wine were prevented by the NO inhibitor, Nωnitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). L-arginine, not D-arginine, reversed the effect of L-NAME on red wine infusion. Red wine injection induced a 3 fold increase in total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter values of rat plasma with respect to controls, while white wine and alcohol did not show any effect. Our study provides evidence that red wine modulates primary haemostasis and prevents experimental thrombosis in rats, independently of its alcohol content, by a NO-mediated mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Wine {{polyphenols}} could {{reinforce the}} endogenous antioxidant system. thereby diminishing oxidative damage. Studies in chronic models {{to understand the}} relationship between the bioavailability of polyphenols and their biological effects are still lacking. The aim {{of the present study was}} to prove the hypothesis that the antioxidant capacity of vines in vitro is positively correlated with the antioxidant capacity of plasma and negatively correlated with tissue lipid peroxidation, after chronic wine consumption. Adult rats received: water (control group). wine having variable phenolic content, ethanol (12. 5 % v/v) or <b>alcohol-free</b> red <b>wine,</b> for 4 weeks. The antioxidant capacity of wines in vitro and that of plasma induced in vivo were assessed through the reduction of ferric iron (FRAP. ferric reducing ability of plasma). Lipid peroxidation (production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), were determined in kidneys fiver and lung. The phenolic content of wines was positively correlated with their FRAP values in vitro (r = 0. 407. p < 0. 002). Also. the relationship between wine FRAP in vitro to its respective plasma value in vivo showed a positive correlation (r = 0. 433, p < 0. 005). Phenolic concentration of wine did not influence the activity of CAT. SOD and GSH-Px of the three organs studied, but it was negatively correlated with their production of TBARS (r = - 0. 852. - 0. 891 and - 0 - 790 for kidney, liver and lung, respectively, p < 0. 001). The present data provide evidence that the antioxidant capacity of wine in vitro implicates a homologous effect in vivo, thus helping to modulate tissue lipid peroxidatio...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} perform a {{chemical}} analysis of both Alibernet red <b>wine</b> and an <b>alcohol-free</b> Alibernet red <b>wine</b> extract (AWE) and to investigate the effects of AWE on nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production as well as blood pressure development in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Total antioxidant capacity together with total phenolic and selected mineral content was measured in wine and AWE. Young 6 -week-old male WKY and SHR were treated with AWE (24, 2 [*]mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. Total NOS and SOD activities, eNOS and SOD 1 protein expressions, and superoxide production were determined in the tissues. Both antioxidant capacity and phenolic content were significantly higher in AWE compared to wine. The AWE increased NOS activity in the left ventricle, aorta, and kidney of SHR, while it did not change NOS activity in WKY rats. Similarly, increased SOD activity in the plasma and left ventricle was observed in SHR only. There were no changes in eNOS and SOD 1 expressions. In conclusion, phenolics and minerals included in AWE may contribute directly to increased NOS and SOD activities of SHR.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The pre-drinking mood {{state has}} been {{indicated}} {{to be an important}} factor in the mood effects of alcohol. However, for moderate alcohol consumption there are no controlled studies showing this association. Also, the mood effects of consuming alcohol combined with food are largely unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of moderate alcohol combined with a meal on ambiance-induced mood states. Furthermore effects on autonomic nervous system activity were measured to explore physiological mechanisms that may be involved in changes of mood state. METHODS: In a crossover design 28 women (age 18 - 45 y, BMI 18. 5 - 27 kg/m 2) were randomly allocated to 4 conditions in which they received 3 glasses of sparkling white wine (30 g alcohol) or <b>alcohol-free</b> sparkling white <b>wine</b> while having dinner in a room with either a pleasant or unpleasant created ambiance. Subjects filled out questionnaires (B-BAES, POMS and postprandial wellness questionnaire) at different times. Skin conductance and heart rate variability were measured continuously. RESULTS: Moderate alcohol consumption increased happiness scores in the unpleasant, but not in the pleasant ambiance. Alcohol consumption increased happiness and stimulation feelings within 1 hour and increased sedative feelings and sleepiness for 2. 5 hour. Skin conductance was increased after alcohol within 1 hour and was related to happiness and stimulation scores. Heart rate variability was decreased after alcohol for 2 hours and was related to mental alertness. CONCLUSION: Mood inductions and autonomic nervous system parameters may be useful to evaluate mood changes by nutritional interventions. Moderate alcohol consumption elevates happiness scores in an unpleasant ambiance. However, drinking alcohol during a pleasant mood results in an equally positive mood state.
