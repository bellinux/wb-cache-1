Then the author provides the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> {{with reference to the}} fact that the very process as a segment cannot yield the wanted effects on the entire system unless synchronized on the entire network of Yugoslav Railways. This brings us to the fact that our only prospective refers to the synchronous activities and integration into the European rail system as a partner in its own right. The path leading to the materialization of this as compared to the current state of affairs appears to be a difficult one however any failure to integrate leads us into an unavoidable traffic isolation to inevitably exhibit adverse influence onto our entire social/ economic development in the future. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploration}} of online social networks whose members share mutual recommendations and interactions is a time-dependent and contextual-based process {{which aims to}} predict the social status among members, ultimately improving the network 2 ̆ 7 s discoverability to achieve societal gain. To address the difficulties associated with the process, this article presents an integrated recommender model whose statements are time-dependent, interaction-aware, and social context-sensitive. The originality of the proposed model stems from {{the integration of the}} predictive recommender, social networks, and interaction components. Each model is developed based on: (1) a time history and decay algorithm to consider the decreasing intensity of recommendations among members over time; (2) a predictive aggregating function for improved <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> for various social contexts; and, (3) a homophily algorithm to estimate the degree in which a recommender-based contact between similar people occurs to dissimilar people. Details of the framework are described, a recommender search strategy methodology is devised, and a case study is used to demonstrate its capabilities. Possible extensions are then outlined...|$|E

40|$|The 1995 {{marketing}} styles for the 25 market {{advisory service}} programs {{included in the}} AgMAS Project were developed in two steps. The first step was {{the construction of a}} detailed "menu" of the tools and strategies used by each of the advisory programs in marketing corn and soybeans. The menu describes the type of pricing tool, frequency of transactions, and magnitude of transactions. The second step was the development of a daily index of the net amount sold by each market advisory program. To construct such an index, the various futures, options, and cash positions recommended for a program on a given day were weighted by the respective position "delta. " When the daily values of the index were plotted for the entire marketing period, the marketing "profile" for a program was generated. The results show that advisory programs made {{a relatively small number of}} recommendations that primarily involved cash marketing strategies, not futures and options, non-cash marketing recommendations were typically held open for a short period of time, and the re-harvest amount sold averaged 35 percent for corn and 30 percent for soybeans. advisory services, pricing tools, pricing strategies, <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendations,</b> D 4, C 8, D 8, M 3, Q 0, Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} students who attended pre-college orientation activities at specific times {{to determine if}} there were differences in college persistence, demographic factors, and other variables between students in three groups. Attendance was classified as early, middle or late. Persistence was defined as continuous enrollment through four semesters. Both enrolled and nonenrolled students were included in the study;In addition to examining factors which are shown to be related to persistence (Pantages and Creedon, 1978), subjects were surveyed on first semester feelings, freshman year involvement in learning, aspects of campus life, utilization and evaluation of student services, and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> for improving undergraduate education;Students in these three groups differed in their academic interest, in the support they received for being on campus, and in evaluating their pre-college orientation program;In examining the interaction between orientation period and enrollment status, students also differed in how well they utilized their time, familiarity with campus resources, class attendance and how happy they are/were in college. The results of this study show that students who attended early orientation activities were better prepared to make the adjustment to the university environment. Students attending later in the process had lower scores on pre-college persistence predictor variables and were less satisfied with their college environment.

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} decline {{is perceived to}} be widespread in the upland soils of the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies have used nutrient balances to assess the degree and extent of nutrient depletion; these have created awareness but suffer methodological problems as several of the nutrient flows and stocks are not measured. This chapter focuses on the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> soil {{fertility decline}} using soil chemical data (pH, organic C, total N, available P, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable cations) that are routinely collected in soil surveys or for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>recommendations.</b> Soil fertility decline can be assessed using a set of properties from different periods at the same site or from different land-use systems with the same soils.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a framework combining {{a model of}} rational behaviour under dietary constraints, an epidemiological model of diet-related mortality, and a life-cycle-analysis model of environmental impact, which permits the ex-ante <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> dietary <b>recommendations</b> in multiple sustainability dimensions (i. e., taste cost, welfare effect, deaths avoided, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and acidification). It is applied to compare in a French context the relative effects and efficiency of six popular sustainable diet recommendations. The results confirm the synergies between the health and environmental dimensions: healthy-eating recommendations usually {{have a positive effect}} on the environment, although some exceptions exist. Most of the sustainable diet recommendations appear highly cost-effective, but those most commonly promoted on health grounds (e. g., targeting consumption of salt, fruits and vegetables and saturated fat) rank highest in terms of overall efficiency. Moreover, the valuation of benefits indicates that in most cases health benefits are significantly larger than environmental benefits. Overall, the analysis reveals some under-investment in the promotion <b>of</b> sustainable diet <b>recommendations</b> in France. The general lack of enthusiasm in policy circles for informational measures promoting behavioural change may reflect unrealistic expectations about the speed and magnitude of dietary change rather than an objective <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the efficiency of those measures...|$|R

Objective The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical impact and appropriateness of comprehensive medication reviews for clients of CMHTs. Methods Trained pharmacists conducted interviews (30 – 45 min each) with clients of CMHTs to identify actual and potential drug-related problems. The pharmacists prepared medication review reports that detailed their findings and recommendations to optimize drug therapy. An expert panel comprising a psychiatrist, general medical practitioner, mental health pharmacist and medication review pharmacist evaluated reviews for 48 clients of 5 CMHTs. Panelists independently assessed review findings, review <b>recommendations,</b> likelihood <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> implementation and the overall expected clinical impact. Results Two hundred and nine medication review findings and 208 medication review recommendations were evaluated. Panelists agreed with 76 % of findings and considered that 81 % <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> were appropriate. Collectively, 69 % <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> were considered likely to be implemented. Thirty-seven (77 %) reviews were deemed potentially to have a positive clinical impact.
