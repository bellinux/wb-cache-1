40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new component based model {{that makes it}} relatively simple to prove that certain types of landscapes are elementary. We use the model to reconstruct proofs for the Traveling Salesman Problem, Graph Coloring and Min-Cut Graph Partitioning. The same model is then used to efficiently compute the average values over particular partial neighborhoods for these same problems. For Graph Coloring and Min-Cut Graph Partitioning, this computation {{can be used to}} focus search on those moves that are most likely to yield <b>an</b> <b>improving</b> move, ignoring moves that cannot yield <b>an</b> <b>improving</b> move. Let x be a candidate solution with objective function value f(x). The mean value of the objective function over the entire landscape is denoted ¯ f. Normally in an elementary landscape one can only be sure that a neighborhood includes <b>an</b> <b>improving</b> move (assuming minimization) if f(x) > ¯ f. However, by computing the expected value of an appropriate partial neighborhood it is sometimes possible to know that <b>an</b> <b>improving</b> move exists in the partial neighborhood even when f(x) < ¯ f...|$|R

5|$|The XR-1, {{having been}} {{repaired}} in the meantime, {{was once again}} flying, and a contract had been awarded to Platt-Lepage {{for the construction of}} seven pre-production aircraft, to be built to <b>an</b> <b>improved</b> version of the XR-1A design, and designated YR-1A. Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft, which had in the meantime been given a contract for development of <b>an</b> <b>improved</b> version of their VS-300 experimental helicopter, the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945. However, due to continued financial and flight-testing problems, Platt-Lepage proved incapable of meeting this schedule.|$|E
5|$|A revised edition, the Nord Stage 2 {{appeared}} in September 2011, containing <b>an</b> <b>improved</b> synthesizer model and sampler functionality, {{as seen in}} the Nord Wave. The three models of the Stage 2 are the HA-88, containing 88 fully weighted keys, the HA-76, containing 76 weighted keys, and the SW-73, containing 73 semi-weighted keys. An updated model, the Stage 2 EX, with extended memory capacity, was announced in 2015.|$|E
