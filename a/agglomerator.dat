50|$|In recent years, the {{addition}} of an agglomeration drum has improved on the heap leaching process by allowing for a more efficient leach. The rotary drum <b>agglomerator,</b> such as the tyre driven Sepro Agglomeration Drum works by taking the crushed ore fines and agglomerating them into more uniform particles. This makes it much easier for the leaching solution to percolate through the pile, making {{its way through the}} channels between particles.|$|E

Processes where a Sepro Agglomeration Drum can be utilized include gold, copper, uranium and nickel laterite.

40|$|Shredding is the {{component}} {{of the most important}} techniques of mechanical recycling of polymeric materials. It is often used as one of the main preparatory processes, associated with the constitution of composite materials. This means that it is a very important and current problem to be solved in terms of technology, design, and economy, as well as environmental protection. A preparation of composite material components by shredding depends specfically on the expected degree of fineness, appropriate size distribution and desired morphology of an elementary particle. The subject of this work concerns mechanical shredding of polymeric materials in various types of mills and <b>agglomerators.</b> The paper presents the tests for verifying the influence of size and shapes of openings in sieves made in the shredder on selected parameters and properties of the obtained recyclate. During the shredding process, the following parameters were analysed: electricity consumption, temperature inside the shredding chamber and the temperature of the obtained recyclate. Selected properties of the obtained recyclate, such as: geometric features of the recyclate dependent on the applied sieves, bulk density and the angle of natural repose were also determined.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{highlight}} the re-entrainment phenomenon encountered with an electrostatic <b>agglomerator</b> having a fibrous collecting electrode and treating submicron particles. The idea is to propose a process to control the particle number emitted by automotive diesel engines. Rather than trying to directly measure agglomerates of diesel particles exiting the <b>agglomerator,</b> we propose working with a synthetic submicron aerosol dispersed in ambient filtered air as a representative exhaust gas. The study will contribute to build a numerical modeling of the behavior of particles in such a process. The particular point that will be treated here is the collected particle re-entrainment as micron-sized agglomerates. We propose a joint experimentation/modeling approach to approximate the re-entrained aerosol size distribution in controlled conditions. From the modeling point of view, a local approach which uses the method of the balance of moments on agglomerates provides the re-entrained particle size in the <b>agglomerator,</b> according to the filtration conditions. The experimental approach confirms the clearly micron-sized character of the re-entrained agglomerates. This is unambiguously shown by measuring a greater micron particle numerical concentration downstream from the <b>agglomerator</b> than upstream. We show that the fluorescein submicron particles use can greatly simplify the characterization of an electrostatic <b>agglomerator</b> by allowing the use of a commercial laser granulometer to measure the size and the number of the generated agglomerates.

Experimental measurements {{have been carried}} out in both standing-wave and travelling-wave modes using a combination of high power electromagnetic speakers, aerodynamic sirens and mechanically vibrating piston. Agglomeration mechanisms are discussed : the inertial capture and the hydrodynamic collision. Based on the estimated <b>agglomerator</b> size and the specific energy consumption, possible applications of the acoustic <b>agglomerator</b> in industry is discussed, with special emphasis on the possible use of such a device in an environment in which the combined effects of high-pressure, temperature and chemical corrosion make it difficult to use the conventional devices...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{two-dimensional}} rotating <b>agglomerator</b> {{was developed}} {{to carry out the}} flow induced phase inversion (FIPI) based granulation. The process in this <b>agglomerator</b> shows that a continuous paste flow (mixed with liquid binder and primary particles) is extruded into the interstice of two relatively rotating disks, as the paste becomes solidified due to the loss of heat to the disks, it is then broken into granules by the shearing force imposed by the rotating disk. Experimental measurements have shown that the size of these granules is enlarged along the positive radial direction of the disks. It is also found that these granules contain approximately the same quantity of binder in terms of its volume fraction. The paper thus proposes a population balance (PB) model to describe the growth of the granules by considering a size independent agglomeration kernel. The PB simulated results are found to be well capable of describing the change of the particle size distribution (PSD) of the granules in the radial direction. This study also proposes a velocity profile for the paste flow and attempts to establish a quantitative relationship between the granulation rate and the deformation rate as this would help us understand the mechanism of the agglomeration. It is hoped that this study would be used to improve the design of the <b>agglomerator</b> and to assure the control of the process and the granular product quality...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop a device for more {{effective}} treatment of flue gases from submicron particles emitted by power plants burning bituminous coal and by this way the reduction of environment pollution. Electrostatic processes were employed to this goal, as the most effective solution. The solutions hitherto applied in electrostatic precipitation techniques were designed for large particles, typically with sizes> 5 µm, which are easily removed by the action of electrostatic force on the electrically charged particles. In submicron size range (0. 1 - 1 µm) the collection efficiency of an ESP is minimal, because of the low value of electric charge on such particles. In order to avoid problems with the removal of submicron particles of fly ash from the flue gases electrostatic agglomeration has been used. In this process, by applying an alternating electric field, larger charged particles (> 1 µm) oscillate, and the particles "collect" smaller uncharged particles. In the developed <b>agglomerator</b> with alternating electric field, the charging of particles and the coagulation takes place in one stage that greatly simplified the construction of the device, compared to other solutions. The scope of this study included measurements of fractional collection efficiency of particles in the system comprising of <b>agglomerator</b> and ESP for PM 1 and PM 2. 5 ranges, in device made in pilot scale. The collection efficiency for PM 2. 5 was greater than 90 % and PM 1 slightly dropped below 90 %. The mass collection efficiency for PM 2. 5 was greater than 95 %. The <b>agglomerator</b> stage increases the collection efficiency for PM 1 at a level of 5 - 10 %...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project {{deals with the}} separation of diesel soot particles using a two-stage separation system which consist of an electrostatic <b>agglomerator</b> and a cyclone. The total collection efficiencies that can be attained by the system vary between 43 % and 87 %, depending on the engine speed and load. The investigations of the <b>agglomerator</b> showed that its effectivity distinctly decays with increasing engine load. This causes a reduction of the collection efficiency by shifting the size distribution of the agglomerates towards smaller particle sizes. The forces that act on the agglomerates increase with increasing flow rates. The thus induced disagglomeration negatively influences the separation efficiency at high engine speeds. An electrocylone which has been developed during this project attained collection efficiencies between 30 % and 81 %. An improvement of this separator is possible by reducing the reetrainment of collected particles. (orig.) Im Rahmen dieses Vorhabens wurde ein zweistufiges Abscheidesystem zur Abscheidung von Dieselrusspartikeln untersucht, das aus einem Zyklon mit einem vorgeschalteten elektrostatischen <b>Agglomerator</b> besteht. Der mit diesem System erreichbare Gesamtabscheidegrad variiert in Abhaengigkeit von Motorlast und -drehzahl zwischen 43 % und 87 %. Dieser ausgepraegte Einfluss der motorischen Parameter resultiert aus der starken Lastabhaengigkeit der Agglomeratoreffizienz und der zunehmenden Agglomeratzerstoerung im Zyklon bei hohen Abgasvolumenstroemen. Ein im Rahmen dieses Projektes entwickelter Elektrozyklon, der die Vorschaltung einer Agglomerationsstufe ueberfluessig macht, erreichte Gesamtabscheidegrade zwischen 30 % und 81 % und stellt aufgrund seines niedrigen Platzbedarfes eine interessante Alternative zu dem zweistufigen System dar. Eine Steigerung dieser Abscheidegrade ist moeglich, wenn es gelingt die bislang auftretende Wiederaufwirbelung bereits abgeschiedener Partikeln zu vermeiden. (orig.)

40|$|Agglomeration of fine mineral {{particles}} as {{a precursor}} to heap leaching is an important means of enhancing leaching rates and metal recoveries, particularly in processing low grade ores. In this paper, the modelling of a batch drum agglomeration process applied to nickel laterite using population balance model is explored. The coalescence kernels which are linked to feed material and <b>agglomerator</b> operating conditions are reviewed. The use of a physically based coalescence kernel which relates agglomerate layer thickness to binder content and agglomerate consolidation shows great promise for the modelling of the agglomerate size distribution of nickel laterite ore.

40|$|A {{detailed}} laser {{diagnostic study}} has been performed to determine whether aerodynamic mechanisms may be exploited to promote significant agglomeration of fine particles to larger ones, {{with a view to}} enhancing the capture of fine and ultra-fine particles in conventional particle collection devices, such as Electrostatic Precipitators.

40|$|The {{computational}} study {{addressed the}} effectiveness with which a standing wave acoustic field {{could be used}} to deflect quartz particles carried in water at 20 Â°C through a simple parallelepiped control volume representative of a vertically orientated duct geometry dimensioned 50 Ã— 50 Ã— 70 cm 3, with square base. An acoustically driven planar standing wave field produces quasi-static oscillatory pressure gradients within resonant cavities, which are responsible for acoustic forces, which act on particles, located within the acoustic field. These forces drive particles to nodal (no fluctuation) or anti-nodal (continuous fluctuation) planes of pressure. Standing wave fields are generally produced by a transducer driving into a fluid through an adhesively bonded matching layer. The wave is reflected at the opposite boundary layer terminating in an air backing. The chamber is dimensioned so as to produce constructive wave interference between the two waves travelling in opposite directions. The acoustic force has been used in small scale filtration systems to deflect particles and on larger scales as a pre filtration <b>agglomerator</b> clumping very small particles which are otherwise poorly filtered in isolation by conventional methods. The study was twofold, in that a major component of the study comprised developing the architecture of the computational model, the other part comprising qualitative model validation through parameter variation. The study involved coupling between Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Software (OpenFOAM) and Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) Software (LIGGGHTS), through a coupling code (CFDEM) built as an extension to OpenFOAM and tailored for LIGGGHTS. The acoustic field was assumed ideal i. e. in a lossless medium with perfect reflection at the opposite wall. Particle-particle and particle-wall collisions were circumvented by using larger time increments, inadequate to resolve col- lisions, and inserting particles in the bulk of the flow away from any wall boundary. Twenty particles with uniform radial size distribution in the range 5 - 30 micron were seeded in the flow field about 10 cm from the bottom inlet, and carried in the z direction at various flow speeds, 0. 1 ms âˆ’ 1, 0. 5 ms âˆ’ 1 and 1 ms âˆ’ 1, whilst being subject to acoustic forces in the x direction, to investigate deflection response and transducer lengths required to achieve adequate lateral deflection. The model accounted for drag, buoyancy, gravity and primary acoustic forces. Flow velocities distinguished by those maxi mum velocities recorded at duct centrelines were obtained by adjusting pressure gradients across the domain. The fluid continuum was modelled through Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equa- tions, supplemented by an eddy viscosity k âˆ’ two equation turbulence model. The flow profile was validated against the analytic Darcy-Weisbach pressure to mean velocity relation. Two acoustic driv- ing frequencies, 14794 Hz and 26629 Hz, were investigated for each flow rate to determine the effect frequency had on acoustic force magnitude, nodal distribution and particle residence time. Acoustic deflection efficiency was measured as that time or particle vertical travel length required, coinciding with a lateral deflection to within 1. 5 mm of an adjacent nodal plane. From a computational point of interest acoustic force dependencies and trends were qualitatively evaluated for consistency with theoretic equations and published literatur...|$|E
