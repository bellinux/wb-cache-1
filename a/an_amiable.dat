To keep the two ladies from quarrelling over precedence, Cosimo III defined Violante Beatrice's status just before the Electress's arrival by appointing her Governess of Siena.|$|E

A {{significant portion of the}} film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure.|$|E

5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities of the people he met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was <b>an</b> <b>amiable</b> man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had <b>an</b> <b>amiable</b> relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E

However, much of public opinion was on his side. German Kaiser Wilhelm II pardoned him on 16 August 1908. There are some claims that even the Kaiser was amused by the incident, referring to him as <b>an</b> <b>amiable</b> scoundrel, and being pleased with the authority and feelings of reverence that his military obviously commanded in the general population.|$|E

Having first won both the 10,000 and 5,000 meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other leaders, Zátopek led from about half way, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.|$|E

25|$|In {{his work}} Đại Việt sử kí toàn thư, the court {{historian}} Ngô Sĩ Liên praised Trần Nhật Duật {{as not only}} a capable official but also a gentleman of intelligence and culture. Despite holding high position in royal court for many years, Prince Chiêu Văn always kept <b>an</b> <b>amiable,</b> tolerant attitude and was well known as a scholar with wide knowledge. Therefore, he was compared with Guo Ziyi, {{one of the greatest}} generals and mandarins in Chinese history. Modern opinions still consider Trần Nhật Duật, together with Trần Hưng Đạo and Trần Quang Khải, as the most important members of Trần clan who were credited with the victories over Yuan Dynasty and the prosperous situation in Đại Việt afterwards. A main street in Hanoi and many places in Vietnam are named in honour of Trần Nhật Duật.|$|E
25|$|A fastidious dresser, Caruso took {{at least}} two baths a day and enjoyed good food and convivial company. He forged a {{particularly}} close bond with his Met and Covent Garden colleague Antonio Scotti– <b>an</b> <b>amiable</b> and stylish baritone from Naples. Caruso was superstitious and habitually carried several good-luck charms {{with him when he}} sang. He played cards for relaxation and sketched friends, other singers and musicians. His wife, Dorothy said that by the time she knew him, her husband's favorite hobby was compiling scrapbooks. He also amassed a valuable collection of rare postage stamps, coins, watches and antique snuffboxes. Caruso was a heavy smoker of strong Egyptian cigarettes, too. This deleterious habit, combined with a lack of exercise and the punishing schedule of performances that Caruso willingly undertook season after season at the Met, {{may have contributed to the}} persistent ill-health which afflicted the last year of his life.|$|E
25|$|George Banta Sr., a Phi Delt from Franklin-Indiana, was {{instrumental}} in expanding the Delta Gamma sorority. For his efforts, {{he was the only}} man ever initiated into Delta Gamma. Banta would later perform initiation ceremonies for new members of the sorority, including Lillian Vawter, his fiancée. Guy Potter Benton, a graduate of the Phi Delt chapter at Ohio Wesleyan University, was president of Miami University in 1902 when he helped with the founding of Delta Zeta. Dr. Benton aided in the preparation of a ritual, badge, and colors. He was a great assistance to Delta Zeta and at one point chased down a man who stole the newly formed ritual of the sorority. For his work, Delta Zeta named him the Grand Patron of the sorority and is the only man to ever wear the Delta Zeta badge. To this day, <b>an</b> <b>amiable</b> friendship exists between Phi Delta Theta and these two sororities.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{character}} of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, {{the character}} of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. He was <b>an</b> <b>amiable</b> man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet with his tears, to bemoan his fate. His ideal is a quiet retirement {{in the country with}} the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet's yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.|$|E
