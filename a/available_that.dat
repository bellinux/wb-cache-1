Urine test kits are <b>available</b> <b>that</b> detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks' {{first product}} was the Junos router {{operating}} system, which {{was released on}} July 1, 1998. The first Juniper router was made <b>available</b> <b>that</b> September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40. It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM. It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products. The M40 {{was followed by the}} smaller M20 router in December 1999 and the M160 in March 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made <b>available</b> <b>that</b> added support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E
5|$|There {{were still}} many unknown factors. The {{properties}} of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown; {{even more so}} those of plutonium, a chemical element that had only recently been discovered by Glenn Seaborg and his team in February 1941, but which was theoretically fissile. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned breeding plutonium in nuclear reactors from uranium-238 atoms that absorbed neutrons from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only microscopic quantities of plutonium were <b>available</b> <b>that</b> had been produced by cyclotrons.|$|E

5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains a number of software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get past them. There is also an unofficial patch <b>available</b> <b>that</b> fixes some glitches and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are <b>available</b> <b>that</b> contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was <b>available</b> <b>that,</b> although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E

Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line, {{as well as}} remote desktop access software. The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product. The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004. An open interface {{for the development of}} third party tools for the appliance was made <b>available</b> <b>that</b> September.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots <b>available</b> <b>that</b> day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques <b>available</b> <b>that</b> may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom Hearts games contain {{elements}} of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. The games {{are driven by}} a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown {{in the form of}} a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests <b>available</b> <b>that</b> provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea or coffee. The Scuppernong served {{as a means of}} transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its most natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became <b>available</b> <b>that</b> same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also <b>available</b> <b>that</b> can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E
