In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and <b>agglutinin.</b> That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E

This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.|$|E

Adhesion leads to loss of active <b>agglutinins</b> from the flagella and recruitment of new <b>agglutinins</b> from a pool associated with the cell body. We {{have been interested in}} determining the precise cellular location of the pool and learning more about the relationship between <b>agglutinins</b> in the two domains. In the studies reported here we describe methods for purification of mt+ cell body <b>agglutinins</b> by use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography (molecular sieve, ion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction), and sucrose gradient centrifugation. About 90 % of the total <b>agglutinins</b> were associated with the cell body and the remainder were on the flagella. Cell body <b>agglutinins</b> were indistinguishable from mt+ flagellar <b>agglutinins</b> by SDS-PAGE, elution properties on a hydrophobic interaction column, and in sedimentation properties on sucrose gradients. The nonadhesiveness of cell bodies suggested that the cell body <b>agglutinins</b> would be intracellular, but our results are not consistent with this interpretation. We have demonstrated that brief trypsin treatment of deflagellated gametes destroyed all of the cell body <b>agglutinins</b> and, in addition, we showed that the cell body <b>agglutinins</b> were accessible to surface iodination. These results indicated that C. reinhardtii <b>agglutinins</b> have a novel cellular disposition: active <b>agglutinins,</b> representing approximately 10 % of the total cellular <b>agglutinins,</b> are found only on the flagella, whereas the remaining 90 % of these molecules are on the external surface of the cell body plasma membrane in a nonfunctional form. This segregation of cell adhesion molecules into distinct membrane domains before gametic interactions has been demonstrated in sperm of multicellular organisms and may be a common mechanism for sequestering these critical molecules until gametes are activated for fusion. In experiments in which surface- iodinated cell bodies were permitted to regenerate new flagella, we found that the <b>agglutinins</b> (as well as the 350, 000 Mr, major flagellar membrane protein) on the newly regenerated flagella were iodinated. These results indicate that proteins destined for the flagella can reside on the external surface of the cell body plasma membrane and are recruited onto newly forming flagella as well as onto preexisting flagella during fertilization...|$|R

25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut <b>agglutinin</b> receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cold <b>agglutinins</b> and cryoglobulins are {{uncommon}} {{in the same}} patient as observed in our case.

40|$|The complex {{antigenic}} {{structure of}} bacteria raises many practical {{difficulties in the}} use of intact bacteria as diagnostic serological reagents, since the presence of several reactive antigenic groupings may confuse the significance of positive reactions.

Infection with an organism of this group will give rise to the production of flagellar and somatic <b>agglutinins.</b> The classification of the organism responsible for the particular infection, according to the Kaufmann-White scheme (1), depends in part on the differentiation of these <b>agglutinins</b> by the use of chemically treated bacterial suspensions.
