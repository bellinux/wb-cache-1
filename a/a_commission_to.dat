5|$|<b>A</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts {{was awarded to}} Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked {{throughout}} his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the case. Under the chairmanship of Lord Blantyre, the hearing opened on 5February 1697.

5|$|In 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services, the Australian Army's {{most senior}} medical officer, with {{the rank of}} major general. He oversaw the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. In 1944 he accepted <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> edit the medical series volumes of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1939–1945 but {{was never able to}} do so as he was killed in a plane crash in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit {{was made by}} George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|In March 1898, a {{resolution}} {{was introduced in}} Congress for <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. The bill passed the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|On June 3, 2009, Nancy Reagan {{unveiled}} {{a statue of}} her late husband in the United States Capitol rotunda. The statue represents the state of California in the National Statuary Hall Collection. After Reagan's death, both major American political parties agreed to erect a statue of Reagan {{in the place of}} that of Thomas Starr King. The day before, President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act into law, establishing <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> plan activities to mark the upcoming centenary of Reagan's birth.|$|E
5|$|Several forts in Confederate {{territory}} {{remained in}} Union hands. Davis sent <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> Washington {{with an offer}} to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, {{as well as the}} Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State William Seward through Supreme Court Justice John A. Campbell. From Alabama, he later resigned from the federal government. Seward hinted that Fort Sumter would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula was first proposed in 1524, when the Order of St. John sent <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> inspect the Maltese Islands. Back then, the only fortification on the peninsula was a militia watchtower built by the Aragonese in 1488. The tower was strengthened in 1533, but the proposed city was not built since the Order focused on building the fortifications of Birgu, which had become their base.|$|E
50|$|Organizationally, {{the pact}} {{established}} three commissions: <b>a</b> Political <b>Commission</b> <b>to</b> work out <b>a</b> timetable and guidelines for future elections, <b>a</b> Human Rights <b>Commission</b> <b>to</b> oversee and promote improvements in that area, and <b>a</b> Peace <b>Commission</b> <b>to</b> explore possible resolutions {{of the civil}} conflict. The guidelines established by the pact eased the chaotic governmental situation to some degree; they were also significant in bringing Arena into a formal governmental association with more moderate actors (such as the PDC) and committing the areneros (at least in principle) {{to the preservation of}} some degree of reform.|$|R

5|$|Tiberius {{was elected}} to the office of Tribune of the Plebs in 133 BC. He {{immediately}} began pushing for a programme of land reform, partly by invoking the 240-year-old Sextian-Licinian law that limited the amount of land that could be owned by a single individual. Using the powers of Lex Hortensia, Tiberius established <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> oversee the redistribution of land holdings from the rich to the unlanded urban poor. The commission consisted of himself, his father-in-law and his brother Gaius.|$|E
5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives {{argued that the}} industry was seeing hard times; Lewis accused them of {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> look into their grievances.|$|E

Horvath, however, applied for <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> join the U.S. Navy and was sworn in as a {{lieutenant}} j.g. that August. He was sent at first to Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois for training, where he practiced dentistry and acted as an assistant to Brown, who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team.

5|$|After {{his term}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, where he served as {{the first president of}} the Louisville Medical Institute and the Kentucky Historical Society. In 1840, he was appointed to <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> prosecute land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico, but resigned his commission in 1842 because of failing health. He died July 13, 1843 and was buried on the grounds of Federal Hill, his estate in Bardstown. According to tradition, Stephen Collins Foster, a distant relative of Rowan's, was inspired to write the ballad My Old Kentucky Home after a visit to Federal Hill in 1852, but later historians have been unable to conclude whether or not Foster ever visited the mansion at all. The mansion is now owned by the state of Kentucky and forms the centerpiece of My Old Kentucky Home State Park.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E

5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the pulpit of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> <b>to</b> investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in the pulpit which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Democratic {{rule was}} {{restored}} in 1983, and Duhalde ran {{for mayor of}} Lomas de Zamora. Being a centrist, the PJ appointed him candidate as a compromise between the internal opposing factions. The elections ended in a technical tie with the candidate of the Radical Civic Union (UCR), Horacio Devoy; Duhalde won by just 700 votes. There was a tie in the elections for the local legislature as well, as both the PJ and UCR got eleven legislators. Duhalde reported that a colonel sought his support for a possible coup against the newly elected president Raúl Alfonsín. Duhalde refused and reported directly to Alfonsín himself. He was elected national deputy in 1987, and became {{vice president of the}} Argentine Chamber of Deputies.
