40|$|Improvements in the {{management}} of Natura 2000 sites are essential to achieve the targets set out by the Habitats and Birds Directives of the European Union. A current focus is on the development of management plans, which are fundamental instruments in the implementation of conservation measures. This study explores the viability of using existing forest plans to assist in this purpose. As case study, we consider the regulatory framework of the Veneto Region, northern Italy. We collected quantitative and qualitative data on forest plans at the regional and at three sub-regional spatial scales: local, district, and biogeographical. Forest plans cover about 54 % of the terrestrial area of Natura 2000 sites in Veneto, and 75 % of Sites of Community Importance in the <b>Alpine</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> At the local scale of analysis, metrics from forest plans represent a valuable historical record which can be used to interpret the current state and future trends, especially for forests with long management records. These data can be used to assess biodiversity indicators for the monitoring of Natura 2000 forest and non-forest habitats, in compliance with Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. Moreover, the heterogeneous stand conditions which are promoted by some forest management approaches can improve the conservation efforts for some habitats and species. The scale of local forest plans are typically the most appropriate for implementing habitat management strategies. From this study, we conclude that management authorities should take advantage of the wide spatial coverage and distribution of existing forest plans, especially in mountain areas inside and outside the Natura 2000 network, for the successful conservation of European Union habitats and species...|$|E
40|$|The {{alpine region}} is of crucial {{importance}} for the European Union; as a result, the Carpathian Convention aims at its sustainable development. Since sustainability implies also conservation through natural protected areas, aimed at including regions representative for the national biogeographical space, this article aims at assessing the efficiency of conservation. The methodology consisted of using spatial metrics applied to Romanian and European data on the natural protected areas, land cover and use and their transitional dynamics. The findings show a very good coverage of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> (98 % included in the Convention area, and 43 % of it protected within the Convention area) and of the ecological region of Carpathian montane coniferous forests (88 % included in the Convention area, and 42 % of it protected within the Convention area). The dominant land cover is represented by forests (63 % within the Convention area, and 70 % of the total protected area). The main transitional dynamics are deforestation (covering 50 % of all changes area within the Convention area and 46 % from the changed area within its protected area) and forestations – including afforestation, reforestation and colonization of abandoned agricultural areas by forest vegetation (covering 44 % of all changes area within the Convention area and 51 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000 and deforestation (covering 97 % of all changes area within the Convention area and 99 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000. The {{results suggest that the}} coverage of biogeographical and ecological zones is good, especially for the most relevant ones, but deforestations are a serious issue, regardless of occurring before or after achieving the protection status...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining and {{increasing}} landscape connectivity, especially of forest landscapes, {{are some of}} the main concerns regarding biodiversity conservation. The connectivity of protected areas for different species represents an indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 network. Our research aims to evaluate the connectivity of forest landscapes in the Romanian <b>Alpine</b> <b>Biogeographical</b> <b>Region</b> (ABR) for various terrestrial species. We analysed the distribution of forest patches and Sites of Community Importance (SCI), as part of Natura 2000 network, in the Romanian ABR. We evaluated the connectivity of forest patches for terrestrial species with different dispersal distances, identifying those patches with significant contribution to maintain the forest landscape connectivity, through the graph theory approach. To quantify the importance of each node, we evaluated the dPCconnector fraction derived from the dPC index. Of the 125 SCIs in the Romanian ABR, 71 protected areas have over 1000 ha, four of them have more than 100, 000 ha. The total protected surfaces cover ~ 35 % of the Romanian ABR, and the forest surfaces, protected in SCIs, cover 26 % of the total Romanian ABR. Regarding the connectivity scores, we found that the forest surfaces across the ABR are well connected (0. 89 or 1 for different dispersal distances) in comparison with the Natura 2000 forest patches. The forest patches are well connected especially for the species with large dispersal distance in both cases (d = 25 km). For the species characterized by a small dispersion distance, the connectivity is lower (0. 46) in the case of protected forests. Our results evidence that the connectivity objective of the forest surfaces protected through the Nature 2000 network is not totally achieved. Furthermore new protected areas are needed where the forest are still present for increasing landscape connectivity for species...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} status of 203 amphibian aquatic breeding sites, {{selected from the}} national database of the Societas Herpetologica Italica (SHI), was surveyed in the period 2008 - 2009 to assess their {{ecological status}}. Sites were randomly extracted, after stratification by the three <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> present in Italy, besides Sardinia and Sicily. The field surveys, conducted by professionals, amateurs and volunteers, showed that since 1979 about 11 % of the sites were destroyed or no more suitable for the reproduction of amphibians that bred in the same site in the past. The percentage of destroyed or altered sites was 8 %, both in the Mediterranean and <b>Alpine</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> and 15 % in the Continental one. However, there were no statistical significant differences among the regions, suggesting {{that the rate of}} amphibian site loss was similar in different parts of Italy. This nation-wide monitoring project demonstrated that in Italy, during the last thirty years, a relevant proportion of amphibian breeding habitats has been destroyed or altered. The main cause of site alteration were land reclamation and water extraction...|$|R

At the European level, the control of invasive alien species is a major goal of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and a cornerstone, in this sense, is the Regulation (EU) no. 1143 / 2014 on invasive alien species. In this study, {{we focus on the}} <b>Alpine</b> and Continental <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of Europe (defined in art. 1 of the Habitats Directive; 92 / 43 /EEC), and aim to give an overview of the main protected forest habitat types threatened by invasive alien species, and focus on five major invasive alien tree species (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Prunus serotina, Quercus rubra, and Robinia pseudoacacia). We considered the assessment reports under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for the period 2007 – 2012, and six documents on the interpretation of habitats, to identify those most threatened by invasive alien species and in particular by the five invasive alien trees. We also assessed selected examples of impacts by these alien tree species on different species groups within Natura 2000 sites to highlight potential effects on biodiversity. Riparian forest habitats and oak dominated woodlands are among the most prone to invasion within the two <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> A. altissima and R. pseudoacacia are the most reported invasive alien trees in these protected forest habitat types. Furthermore, examples of the impacts of these tree species have indicated potential detrimental effects on forest habitats structure and functions, and on single species listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives. In conclusion, we emphasise the need for effective management and systematic monitoring of these five invasive alien tree species within Natura 2000 sites...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} for biogeographers and conservation planners {{is to identify}} where to best locate or distribute high-priority areas for conservation and to explore whether these areas are well represented by conservation actions such as protected areas (PAs). We aimed to identify high-priority areas for conservation, expressed as hotpots of rarity-weighted richness (HRR) -sites that efficiently represent species-for birds across EU countries, and to explore whether HRR are well represented by the Natura 2000 network. Natura 2000 is an evolving network of PAs that seeks to conserve biodiversity through {{the persistence of the}} most patrimonial species and habitats across Europe. This network includes Sites of Community Importance (SCI) and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), where the latter regulated the designation of Special Protected Areas (SPA). Distribution maps for 416 bird species and complementarity-based approaches were used to map geographical patterns of rarity-weighted richness (RWR) and HRR for birds. We used species accumulation index to evaluate whether RWR was efficient surrogates to identify HRRs for birds. The results of our analysis support the proposition that prioritizing sites in order of RWR is a reliable way to identify sites that efficiently represent birds. HRRs were concentrated in the Mediterranean Basin and <b>alpine</b> and boreal <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of northern Europe. The cells with high RWR values did not correspond to cells where Natura 2000 was present. We suggest that patterns of RWR could become a focus for conservation biogeography. Our analysis demonstrates that identifying HRR is a robust approach for prioritizing management actions, and reveals the need for more conservation actions, especially on HRR...|$|R

40|$|Background: Italian forests {{contains}} a high total diversity of plants species {{and this is}} likely due to the huge biogeographical gradients covered by the country (from the Alps to the Mediterranean) {{as well as to}} the long lasting human exploitation and management practices. This study aims to investigate the interactive effects of ecology and biogeography in determining the total plant diversity of Italian forests using a spatially representative sample of forests made of 201 plots sampled all over the country (CONECOFOR LI network). The general hypothesis to be tested is that the effects of present day ecological factors are less important than biogeographical factors in determining the total diversity of forested areas. The plant diversity of the sampled forest plan communities was divided into different spatial components, in particular: plot, site, forest type (used as a proxy for present day ecological conditions) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Species presence absence was only used. The three following hypotheses have then been tested: Hypothesis 1 : The diversity component accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components (plot, site, forest type). Hypothesis 2 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent).

40|$|Aim: Climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers) are {{under-represented}} in many global datasets that underpin {{knowledge in}} functional trait biology, important for ecological theory, conservation and predicting forest dynamics under global change. To address this omission, we tested {{a set of}} hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location: Global. Methods: Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, climbing mechanism, dispersal mode, and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses across species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results: We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> SLA and seed mass {{were the only two}} traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> Main conclusions: The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others. 15 page(s...|$|R
