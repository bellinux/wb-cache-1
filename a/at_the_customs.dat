The raid failed, but may have delayed the Syrian attack on Degania, thus giving its defenders twenty-four hours to prepare. A second raid, by a Yiftach company, crossed the Jordan and struck the Syrian camp <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> House, near the main Bnot Yaakov Bridge. After a short battle, the Syrian defenders (one or two companies) fled. The Palmachniks destroyed the camp and several vehicles, including two armored cars, without losses.|$|E

In late January, the king appointed Rosenberg as a customs appraiser in Honolulu, although the appointment was controversial; by mid-February he was fired by the head of customs. One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as the new head of customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a guard <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> Office, although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E

During this expedition he discovered a new species of anopheline mosquito, which after identification by Major James, I.M.S., was named after him as Anopheles aitkeni. During his service he took to writing the Annual Reports of the Customs Department and was frequently thanked for the same.

25|$|The couple faced another hurdle when Brenda {{wanted to}} publish {{an article about}} the alarm of her {{pregnancy}} but Dylan objected, arguing that it was very personal. Typical of their relationship, Brenda and Dylan were once again reconciled after another dispute. In addition, Brenda was the victim of an armed robbery at the Peach Pit. This scene shocked her a lot and led her to see a psychologist, Dylan helped her a lot when she began to have nightmares about this event. Things get more serious when Brenda {{spends a lot of time}} with Dylan without worrying about the limitations imposed by her parents. The latter invited her to a trip to Mexico and Brenda agrees, despite the formal prohibition of her father. The trip will be punctuated by a dispute and a passage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>customs</b> where Brenda will realize that she does not have her passport and is therefore forced to phone her parents. When Brenda's parents are aware of her trip to Mexico with Dylan, the girl's father formally banned her from seeing him again. But she refuses to break and hides her relationship with Dylan.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson {{received}} his primary education at Centenary Tabernacle Day School before entering United Methodist Collegiate School in 1911. There, he engaged in numerous leadership activities. On one such occasion, he led his classmates in {{a protest against}} unreasonable punishment by school authorities. He also edited the school's newspaper, Wall Paper. He dropped out two years later to support his family. He was first employed as a temporary outdoor officer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>customs</b> department. Soon, he became a permanent employee of the department. He became involved in a labour strike for increased pay and better working conditions. It is widely believed that Wallace-Johnson led the strike, but this fact remains uncertain. All employees involved in the strike were dismissed, but reinstituted to their jobs a year later after the Secretary of State for the Colonies assessed the case. During the one-year break, he held jobs as a surveyor, farmer, fisher and a clerk in a law office. He was very popular as a lay preacher among rural villagers. He was interested in joining the ministry, but he lacked the proper education needed to enter the occupation. All during this time, he wrote articles in the Aurora, a newspaper edited by H. C. Bankole-Bright. Wallace-Johnson considered Bankole-Bright {{to be the most}} influential person in his life at the time. Following a 1938 feud, Bankole-Bright would become Wallace-Johnson's political nemesis.|$|E

500|$|Approximately 500 Zanzibari men {{and women}} were killed or wounded during the bombardment, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace. It is unknown how many of these {{casualties}} were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been [...] "decimated". British casualties amounted to one Petty Officer severely wounded aboard Thrush who later recovered. Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's Indian quarter suffered from opportunistic looting, and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in the chaos. To restore order, 150 British Sikh troops were transferred from Mombasa to patrol the streets. Sailors from St George and Philomel were landed to form a fire brigade to contain the fire, which had spread from the palace to the nearby customs sheds. There was some concern about the fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>customs</b> sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but no explosion occurred.|$|E

At 9:30a.m., authorities detained Hendrix after finding {{a small amount of}} what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. A mobile lab was set up to determine what had been found, and at 1:30p.m. Metro police detective Harry Midgley arrested him for illegal possession of narcotics.

Believing that the Spanish forces would not come to his aid, on August 5, Veve went to the lighthouse to seek American protection of his town from the Spanish. [...] Obtaining an invitation from Captains Rodgers and Charles J. Barclay of Amphitrite, Dr. Veve and other Fajardan civic leaders rowed out to the American monitor on the morning of August 5, and persuaded the naval captains to protect the women and children of the prominent town families from a feared Spanish reprisal. Leyden had since returned from St. Thomas and Puritan, Hannibal and the two army transports proceeded on to Ponce. On the afternoon of August 5, Captain Barclay, Ensign Albert Campbell, a few prominent Fajardan leaders, including Veve and a landing party of 14 bluejackets boarded the shallow-draft Leyden and navigated through the shoals to shore. The American bluejackets and the contingent of Fajardans posted the American flag <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Customs</b> House in the harbor and marched to the town where they hoisted the United States flag over the City Hall. Before the sailors returned to their ship, Barclay organized a citizens militia to patrol the town and appointed Dr. Veve as military governor of the eastern region of Puerto Rico.|$|E
