5|$|The film {{required}} a lengthy production period, taking {{over a year}} for the casting to be completed and another year and three months for editing. Burshtein, who was doubtful <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the process would be completed, took a step-by-step approach, focusing first on the writing, then on accumulating enough funding for the project, followed by the filming and editing. Burshtein became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to direct a film intended for wide distribution. The film premiered at the 69th Venice Film Festival on 1 September 2012 and was later released in the United States on 24 May 2013.|$|E
5|$|Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He {{was caught}} in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial {{proposal}} to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet {{for the sake of the}} Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

60|$|Of his shorter pieces, {{the three}} Elegies on Birds are well deserving of notice.

Thrice has Shenstone mentioned it in his Letters, {{in such a manner}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> show <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it had pleased him. The Goldfinches is only less excellent. He has spoiled the Swallows by the seriousness of the moral.|$|R
25|$|There is some {{question}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the pottery {{of this age}} relies on Minoan pottery for both their shapes and the patterns.

25|$|Historians {{are divided}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> to credit Lagrange {{and others for}} the {{development}} of Fourier theory: Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler had introduced trigonometric representations of functions, and Lagrange had given the Fourier series solution to the wave equation, so Fourier's contribution was mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series.|$|E

25|$|In effect, the Target Insulation is a {{ratio of}} 1.33W/m²·K of wall area (Document L 2006).

25|$|Although {{neutrino}} oscillations {{have been}} experimentally confirmed, the theoretical foundations are still controversial, {{as it can}} be seen in the discussion related to sterile neutrinos. This makes predictions of possible Lorentz violations very complicated. It is generally assumed that neutrino oscillations require a certain finite mass. However, oscillations could also occur as a consequence of Lorentz violations, so there are speculations <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> those violations contribute to the mass of the neutrinos.|$|E

5000|$|Relative Humidity (RH) is {{the amount}} of water held in the air <b>as</b> related <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> could be held in fully {{saturated}} air. The possible amount of moisture held at a given time is directly related to temperature; warm air holds more humidity than cold. Collecting institutions aim to keep the RH constant in exhibitions and storage areas because many organic objects expand and contract as both temperature and RH change. Furniture will swell and stick with high moisture, but may crack or shrink if there is too little. “Rapidly fluctuating temperature and relative humidity compound all of these effects.” [...] High humidity may accelerate mold growth and some chemical changes, like metal corrosion, if not properly maintained.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{beneficial}} roles of riparian buffers is {{the capacity to}} attenuate groundwater nitrate before it can discharge to streams. Denitrification {{is one of the}} most important processes that permanently removes nitrate from groundwater; it requires anoxic conditions, a carbon source, and a suitable residence time as the reaction is microbially mediated. As denitrification rates are highly dependent on carbon availability, there is a higher potential towards the soil surface where carbon sources are more abundant. These facts highlight the importance of hillslope-floodplain hydrology <b>as</b> <b>to</b> determine <b>how</b> <b>much</b> nitrate can be removed from the landscape. There are three crucial hydrological factors that impact denitrification...|$|R

[...] This is vital in understanding {{the nature of a}} novel which, to an extent, lends itself quite easily to misunderstandings and criticisms. Indeed, some of the confusion stems from the subtitle A Memoir in the Form of a Novel, which may lead one to believe that Oliver alone is the fictional representation of Santayana.|$|R
