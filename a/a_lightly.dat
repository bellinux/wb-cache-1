5|$|M-90 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan. It runs from near North Branch eastward to Lexington situated on Lake Huron. The highway is <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> traveled roadway that runs through rural farmlands. The trunkline runs mostly east–west with two short north–south segments where it turns to run concurrently with other state highways. Along the routing, there are two river crossings and one railroad crossing.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route252 (NY252) is an east–west {{state highway}} south of Rochester in Monroe County, New York, in the United States. The western {{terminus}} {{of the route}} is at an intersection with NY33A in Chili and the eastern terminus is at a junction with NY64 and NY96 {{in the village of}} Pittsford. NY252 passes {{through the center of the}} town of Henrietta's commercial district, where it intersects NY15. The route passes through three distinct areas: <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated, rural area of Chili west of the Genesee River, the heavily developed commercial district centered on NY252's intersections with NY15 and NY15A, and a mostly residential area of the town of Pittsford.|$|E

The Kingfisher's high operating ceiling of 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections back to the ship. The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot down or forced to ditch in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continued}} onward through open fields, intersecting CR86 {{just before}} passing over the New York State Thruway (I-90). Past the Thruway, NY428 continued north along Silver Creek {{into the village}} of Silver Creek, where it became known as Division Street at the village line. It followed Division Street for two blocks through <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated area before turning west onto Burgess Street for another two blocks through a more densely populated portion of the community. NY428 ended at an intersection with US20 south of the village center.|$|E
5|$|In Somerset, NY148 {{remains a}} two-lane roadway, passing through sparsely {{developed}} areas {{on its way}} to the village of Barker. In the southern part of the community, the route meets Coleman and West Somerset roads (CR2 and CR3, respectively). Through Barker, NY148 is a two-lane residential street, passing west of Barker Free Library and east of Barker High School. After Haight Road, NY148 leaves the village, continuing north through <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated area. At Arlington Road, the number of homes along NY148 rises once again as the route enters the hamlet of Somerset, located at the junction of NY148 and NY18 (Lake Road). This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY148, while CR15 continues north through Somerset towards Lake Ontario.|$|E

5|$|NY141 {{begins at}} a trumpet {{interchange}} with NY9A {{on the western}} edge of the hamlet of Hawthorne, located within the town of Mount Pleasant. This junction also serves as the south end of NY9A's overlaps with NY100. NY141 initially heads to the northeast as an independent route, following the two ramps not carrying either direction of NY100. After just , all four ramps merge into a four-lane divided highway, creating a short overlap between NY141 and NY100. The divided highway ends at Brighton Avenue, the first road that it intersects. NY100 splits from NY141 here, following Brighton Avenue southward while NY141 heads southeastward along the two-lane Broadway, passing through <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> developed commercial area. After one block, the route intersects Bradhurst Avenue, here a state-maintained street serving as a one-block spur of NY100.|$|E
5|$|NY264 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with CR57 (Main Street; formerly NY57) {{in the village}} of Phoenix, located in the town of Schroeppel. The route proceeds north through the village as a two-lane road named Volney Street, passing several blocks of homes before crossing CSX Transportation's Baldwinsville Subdivision rail line. Past the railroad, NY264 leaves the Phoenix village limits, taking on a northwesterly alignment as it continues through <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated area of the town of Schroeppel as an unnamed road. NY481 approaches NY264 from the southeast, and the freeway loosely parallels the surface road as NY264 intersects the eastern terminus of CR59. Not far to the north, the route enters an interchange with NY481 (exit14) and meets the nearby southern terminus of CR6.|$|E
5|$|NY38 {{proceeds}} out of Freeville, {{passing over}} Fall Creek and heading north along Groton Road through <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated {{area of the}} town of Dryden. The route passes by a mixture of open fields, forests, and isolated homes {{on its way to the}} Dryden–Groton town line, where it meets the southern terminus of NY34B southeast of the hamlet of Peruville. NY38 parallels the Owasco Inlet into Groton and the village of the same name, becoming Peru Road at the southern village line. It continues north, following South and Main Streets through the densely populated village to an intersection with NY222's western terminus at Cortland Street. At this point, NY38 becomes Cayuga Street and winds its way northward along the Owasco Inlet and out of the village. Now known as Locke Road, NY38 heads the northwest through another rural, largely undeveloped area into Cayuga County.|$|E

5|$|Scelidosaurus was an ornithischian. It was {{the oldest}} ornithischian known until the {{description}} of Geranosaurus in 1911. During the twentieth century, it has been classified at different times as an ankylosaur or stegosaur. Alfred von Zittel (1902), William Elgin Swinton (1934), and Robert Appleby et al. (1967) identified the genus as a stegosaurian, though this concept then encompassed all armoured forms. In a 1968 paper, Romer argued it was an ankylosaur. In 1977, Richard Thulborn of the University of Queensland attempted to reclassify Scelidosaurus as an ornithopod similar to Tenontosaurus or Iguanodon. Thulborn argued Scelidosaurus was <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> built bipedal dinosaur adapted for running. Thulborn's 1977 theories on the genus have since been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda (JTWC designation: 20S, {{also known}} as simply Cyclone Glenda) of March 2006 was among the strongest {{tropical}} cyclones to threaten Western Australia, though it weakened considerably before landfall and moved ashore in <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated region. It began as a tropical low on 15 March in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The precursor disturbance drifted over Top End and later across the northeastern portion of Western Australia, and after emerging into the Indian Ocean it strengthened into a tropical storm. Aided by favourable environmental conditions, Glenda rapidly intensified to reach Category5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and with a peak intensity of 910mbar it was among the strongest cyclones on record within the Australia region. On 30 March it moved ashore near Onslow as a Category3 cyclone, {{and the next day}} it degenerated into a remnant tropical low over land.|$|E

5|$|The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were {{planning}} {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish goatherd who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which {{the east side of the}} Rock of Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the upper section was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east side was considered virtually impregnable, only the west side was fortified; if the Rock could be climbed from the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> armed force.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY26 in Cincinnatus, {{a town in}} eastern Cortland County. It heads east across the Otselic River and through the hamlet of Lower Cincinnatus before curving to the northeast and crossing into Chenango County very soon afterward. Across the county line, it continues northeast through <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> developed valley surrounding Brakel Creek to the Pharsalia State Wildlife Management Area, where it connects with CR42, a highway that was once part of NY23. From here, the route heads southeastward along another valley, this one surrounding Canasawacta Creek, {{to the city of}} Norwich, the county seat of Chenango County. It heads east–west across the city on Pleasant and Rexford streets, passing through mostly residential areas and intersecting with NY12 at Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) celestial body could bear signs of such activity.|$|E
