5000|$|Dr. Robert W. Hutson (1920-2001), a California periodontist, {{designed}} and patented a toothbrush in 1950. The application for his [...] "Hutson toothbrush" [...] was filed on January 13, 1950, and U.S. Patent No. 160,604 was granted on October 24 the same year. In 1958, he {{was granted a}} new patent for a [...] "mouthbrush" [...] having numerous fine, soft, flat-ended nylon bristles, and a similar appearance to the 1950 design. [...] He claimed in his application that this brush was less abrasive to tooth enamel, better for massaging the gums, and more effective at picking up tooth powder than other brushes available at the time, which had coarse, <b>angle-cut</b> bristles.|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} minus {{identity}} lenses {{with the}} <b>angle-cut</b> collimator can achieve high contrast image in high-energy proton radiography. This article presents the principle of choosing the <b>angle-cut</b> aperture of the collimator for the different energies and objects. The numerical simulation using the Monte Carlo code Geant 4 has been implemented to investigate the entire radiography for the French test object. The optimum <b>angle-cut</b> apertures of the collimators are also obtained for different energies...|$|E
40|$|The usual {{configuration}} of uniaxial {{whispering gallery mode}} resonators is a disk shaped geometry where the optic axis points along the symmetry axis, a so called z-cut resonator. Recently x-cut resonators, where the optic axis lies in the equatorial plane, became of interest as they enable extremely broadband second harmonic generation. In this paper {{we report on the}} properties of a more generalized system, the so called <b>angle-cut</b> resonator, where the optic axis exhibits an arbitrary angle against the symmetry axis. We show experimentally that the modal structure and quality factors are similar to common resonators but that the polarization properties differ quite significantly: due to the asymmetry the polarization depends on the equatorial position and is, in general, elliptical.

40|$|High energy protons of 10 to 50 GeV {{can be used}} to {{radiograph}} dense objects. Because the transmitted beam particles undergo multiple {{coulomb scattering}} (MCS) in the object, a magnetic lens system is used to focus the particles exiting each point of the object onto a distant image plane. Without the lens, the MCS would seriously blur the radiographic image. Correlations can be introduced in the illuminating beam to cancel {{a major part of the}} chromatic and geometric aberrations in the lens, while providing locations inside the lens where the rays are sorted by MCS angle. This allows the introduction of angle cut apertures to aid material identification. The requirement for a matched multistage lens system with successively smaller <b>angle-cut</b> apertures leads to the use of minus-identity ({minus}I) lenses, in which the angle sorting is in the longitudinal mid plane of the lens, and the exit beam correlations are the same as the input correlations. A single stage {minus}I lens has been successfully tested at Brookhaven with 10 -GeV protons and another is being used in dynamic experiments with 0. 8 -GeV protons at Los Alamos. The resolution achievable at higher energies is briefly surveyed...|$|E
40|$|Coherence domain optical imaging {{techniques}} have been developing {{quickly in the}} past few decades after the invention of laser. In this thesis, I will report the imaging methods that constitute my research projects during these years of graduate studies, including paired-angle-rotation scanning (PARS) forward-imaging probe for optical coherence tomography (OCT), full-field phase imaging technique based on harmonically matched diffraction grating (G 1 G 2 grating), and Fresnel zone plate (FZP) based optifluidic microscopy (OFM). Compared with conventional optical microscopy, the coherence domain optical imaging has many advantages and greatly extends the application of {{imaging techniques}}. OCT, based on low-coherence interferometry, is a high-resolution imaging technique that has been successfully applied to many biomedical applications. The development of various probes for OCT further made this technique applicable to endoscopic imaging. In the project of PARS-OCT probe, I have developed a forward-imaging probe based on two rotating <b>angle-cut</b> GRIN lenses. The diameter of the first prototype PARS-OCT probe that I made is 1. 65 mm. My colleagues further built a probe with diameter of 0. 82 mm. To our knowledge, this is the smallest forward-imaging probe that has been reported. The first prototype probe was characterized and successfully used to acquire OCT images of a Xenopus laevis tadpole. Full-field phase imaging techniques are important for metrology and can also obtain high-resolution images for biological samples, especially transparent samples such as living cells. We have developed a novel full-field phase imaging technique based on the G 1 G 2 grating. The G 1 G 2 interferometry uses the G 1 G 2 grating as a beam splitter/combiner and can confer nontrivial phase shift between output interference signals. Thus the phase and intensity information of the sample can be obtained by processing the two direct CCD images acquired at the output ports of the G 1 G 2 grating. The details of this technique are explained in this thesis, and the phase imaging results for standard phase objects and biological samples are also shown. OFM is a novel high-resolution and low-cost chip-level microscope developed by our group several years ago. Combining the unique imaging concept and microfluidic techniques, OFM system can be potentially useful to many biomedical applications, such as cytometry, blood parasite diagnosis, and water quality inspection. In the project of FZP-OFM, I applied the FZP to project the OFM aperture array onto an imaging sensor for OFM imaging. In this way, the sensor and the aperture array can be separated and will be useful for some situations. To demonstrate its capability, the FZP-OFM system was used to acquire OFM images of the protist Euglena gracilis. The studies in my research show the possibility of the application of various coherence domain optical imaging techniques in biomedical area, which is the primary objective of this thesis...|$|E
