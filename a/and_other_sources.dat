Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E
