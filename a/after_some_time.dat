At Lambeth, Vermigli assisted Cranmer by helping write sermons against the rebellion. <b>After</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> he returned to Oxford, where he was made first canon of Christ Church in January 1551.

The team {{repeated the}} Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> {{away from}} TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live {{to declare that}} he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> off {{to recover}} in Zwittau, Schindler was {{promoted}} to second in command of his Abwehr unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava, on the Czech-Polish border, in January 1939. He was involved in espionage {{in the months leading}} up to Hitler's seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March. Emilie helped him with paperwork, processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the Abwehr office. As he frequently travelled to Poland on business, he and his 25 agents were in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland. One assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass, deemed critical for the movement of German troops. Schindler continued to work for Abwehr until as late as fall 1940, when he was sent to Turkey to investigate corruption among the Abwehr officers assigned to the German embassy there.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> Neto's {{parents and}} sister visit him, and are deceived by {{the doctor who}} says Neto {{requires}} months of treatment. Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electric shock treatment. Suddenly, in another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire are missing him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto {{if he wants to}} return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client {{in the midst of a}} sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes Coca-Cola and cachaça. Drunk, he carries his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other. However, he goes berserk and starts to damage the place. The police are called and send him to another psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
