In the original play, Nyasha Hatendi played multiple roles including Spencer, Paul and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Parth Thakerar played these roles in the subsequent UK tour.|$|R

5|$|After its sale to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust, 70000 was {{overhauled}} at Crewe {{and returned}} to the main line in 2011 (its 60th anniversary), initially in unlined black without name plates <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> outshopped in 1951 (the plates were first fitted for the Festival of Britain later that year).|$|E
5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>originally</b> built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The {{completed}} house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of unpainted, cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an oriel window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian window on the third floor above that. An oval portico protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>originally</b> planned, the fee {{to enter}} or exit at Howard Beach and Jamaica {{would have been}} $5, with airport and airline {{employees}} receiving a discounted fare of $2. Trips within the airport terminals would be free, as is currently the case. On July 25, 2008, to celebrate the airport's 60th anniversary, the Port Authority let riders use the AirTrain for free for one day.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, Universal {{confirmed}} that the roller coaster would not open <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> planned {{and said it would}} open in the summer. Though Universal has never mentioned what the exact problem with the roller coaster was, it is believed by newspapers that issues with the anti-rollback devices on the lift hill that were not working correctly caused the delay.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 March, the prisoners enacted their plan. Serious {{problems}} arose immediately. The tunnel hatch proved difficult to open and the tunnel exit was several metres short of the relatively safe forested area. These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs managed to make their break for freedom. <b>As</b> <b>originally</b> intended, Marcinkus {{was one of the}} first ten to escape.|$|E

5|$|Trollope's {{fortunes}} suffered {{because of}} the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to mismanagement by the publishers, it was not serialised in a popular magazine, <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> intended. Instead, it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of serialisation that had become unpopular with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.|$|E
5|$|US-60, <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> designated, did {{not enter}} Oklahoma. Instead, it ended in Springfield, Missouri, {{continuing}} east from there. AASHO approved an extension of US-60 on May 29, 1930, which extended it west through Oklahoma to Amarillo, Texas. US-60's extension displaced US-164 in its entirety; that designation was then retired.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|A girl born at {{the station}} in 1924 was the first baby to be born on the Underground network. The Bakerloo line {{building}} remains much <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar proposals have been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran a consultation on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the more}} northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Alan Wake {{was first}} {{released}} {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 video game console. The game {{was scheduled to be}} released on 18 May 2010 in North America, and on 21 May in Europe. When the game went gold on 7 April 2010, the European release date was moved up a week. Therefore, the game was released in Europe first, on 14 May 2010, and then in North America on 18 May, <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> scheduled. On 23 November 2010, Alan Wake was released on the Games on Demand service of Xbox Live. On 16 February 2012, a version of the game for Microsoft Windows was released.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation. There is no representative of deities adorning {{the outside of}} the buildings. This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left <b>as</b> <b>originally</b> constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. <b>As</b> <b>originally</b> proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E
