5|$|Grasshoppers exemplify a {{range of}} anti-predator adaptations, {{enabling}} them to <b>avoid</b> detection, to escape if detected, {{and in some cases}} to <b>avoid</b> being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to <b>avoid</b> detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to <b>avoid</b> the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to <b>avoid</b> unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Chen et al. derived the {{generating}} function for partitions <b>avoiding</b> right nestings and posed {{the problem of}} finding the {{generating function}} for partitions <b>avoiding</b> right crossings. In this paper, we derive the generating function for partitions <b>avoiding</b> right crossings via an intermediate structure of partial matchings <b>avoiding</b> 2 -right crossings and right nestings. We {{show that there is}} a bijection between partial matchings <b>avoiding</b> 2 -right crossing and right nestings and partitions <b>avoiding</b> right crossings...|$|R

5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to <b>avoid</b> detection, scientific divers to <b>avoid</b> disturbing marine animals, and media divers to <b>avoid</b> bubble interference.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{preventative}} measures are recommended, including <b>avoiding</b> straining {{while attempting to}} defecate, <b>avoiding</b> constipation and diarrhea either by eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluid or by taking fiber supplements, and getting sufficient exercise. Spending less time attempting to defecate, <b>avoiding</b> reading while on the toilet, and losing weight for overweight persons and <b>avoiding</b> heavy lifting are also recommended.|$|R

5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} withdrawal symptoms.

5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} <b>avoid</b> {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to <b>avoid</b> prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately <b>avoid</b> conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{obtain the}} {{generating}} functions for partial matchings <b>avoiding</b> neighbor alignments and for partial matchings <b>avoiding</b> neighbor alignments and left nestings. We {{show that there}} is a bijection between partial matchings <b>avoiding</b> the three neighbor patterns (neighbor alignments, left nestings and right nestings) and set partitions <b>avoiding</b> right nestings via an intermediate structure of upper triangular matrices. Combining our bijection and the bijection given by Dukes and Parviainen between upper triangular matrices and self-modified ascent sequences, we get a bijection between partial matchings <b>avoiding</b> the three neighbor patterns and self-modified ascent sequences...|$|R

30|$|Demographics {{indicated}} different {{trends in}} responses among respondents. The four Chinese men who participated were largely unable to produce responses regarding <b>avoided</b> clothing and styles. One of these respondents said he only <b>avoids</b> clothing that is “too colorful or fashionable” because “it {{is not his}} style.” Another said he only <b>avoids</b> “hip-hop clothing” {{because it does not}} match his serious personality. The other two respondents said that there were no types of clothing or styles they <b>avoided.</b> These sentiments contrast greatly with the responses from American students, all but one of whom listed one or several types of <b>avoided</b> clothing and styles.|$|R
