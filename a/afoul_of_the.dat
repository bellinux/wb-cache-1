5|$|Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did {{not share}} a united {{political}} view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral. This stance was adopted to ensure the magazine did not fall <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial government's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government. However, writings falling under various parts the political spectrum were published, including works by cultural nationalists, a sonnet dedicated to Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg, and notes on fascism.|$|E
5|$|His 1815 Polish {{translation}} of Homer's Iliad {{met with a}} negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume Works (Dzieła). Volumes 7–9 comprised his Humankind: A Didactic Poem (Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as {{an important contribution to}} the history of Polish philosophy. However, the work ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E

2500|$|With {{that finding}} as anchor, the Court ruled a total ban on {{operative}} handguns {{in the home}} is unconstitutional, as <b>the</b> ban runs <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> self-defense purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Amendment – a purpose not previously articulated by the Court – and the [...] "in common use at the time" [...] prong <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Miller decision: since handguns are in common use, their ownership is protected.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States {{government to}} have him overthrown. The US was also concerned {{by the presence of}} communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
50|$|As was {{the case}} with many artists and writers working under Stalinism, Lebedev ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> {{official}} censorship. <b>The</b> book Inside the Rainbow - Russian Children's Literature 1920-35: Beautiful Books, Terrible Times offered by Dutch publishers Pegasus details threats made by Soviet authorities against Lebedev. The book was <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> reviews in <b>The</b> Guardian and The Financial Times, among other publications.|$|R
5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} to move against him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> Himmler in <b>the</b> late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|R

5|$|While Cáceres {{was engaged}} in what would evidently be a lengthy siege, Montejo sent a column of Spanish {{soldiers}} into the area around Gracias a Dios; he sent a second column, with 20 Spaniards accompanied by native auxiliaries, south to the Valley of Xocorro. Montejo led a third column in person, taking 23 Spanish soldiers to Comayagua. He also sent a message ahead, for Santa María de Comayagua to send support to Cáceres at the Peñol, and fourteen soldiers marched from there to join the siege. The Xocorro column was forced to return to Santa María de Comayagua after falling <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish authorities in San Miguel, who claimed they were infringing upon their jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{diabetes}} worsened {{during the}} course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. Cẩn left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, to Catholic charities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's {{presidency}} in 1951, Jacobo Árbenz {{was elected to the}} {{presidency in}} a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz' policies ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Fruit Company, which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz' overthrow, and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power {{at the head of a}} military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations against civilians.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1930, Harry M. Wicks, {{using the}} {{pseudonym}} [...] "Herbert Moore," [...] his given and middle names, arrived in Sydney, Australia as a plenipotentiary representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comintern. Wicks made use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> self-criticism — ritual public confession of failings by [...] "errant" [...] individuals — {{as a means}} of instilling ideological uniformity and party discipline. Australian party leaders Jack Ryan and Jack Kavanagh were two who ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> Wicks during <b>the</b> reorganization.|$|R
25|$|In late 1972 Tek {{had joined}} the band TV Jones as lead singer/guitarist along with Chris Jones on guitar, Gerry Jones on drums (brother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> now {{successful}} jazz trumpet player Vince Jones), Giles Vanderwerf on bass. TV Jones had a fanatical cult following in Wollongong, {{to the point where}} things got crazed and dangerous where by in 1974, the group fled north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. The band was hopeful of success, but amid disastrous engagements at Chequers and the Whisky A Go Go, ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> police and organised crime simultaneously. After unsuccessful album recording sessions in North Sydney, the group began to disintegrate, sacking Tek from TV Jones as a negative influence.|$|R
2500|$|Hewett's time at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Normal School can {{be viewed}} as {{generally}} successful. The college was organized along conventional lines for normal colleges, and commenced with several areas of pedagogy directed to <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> degreed teachers, who were needed by the state-to-be. The enrollment increased rapidly and for a time exceeded that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> New Mexico in Albuquerque. However, Hewett fell <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region who disagreed with his increasingly vocal position that <b>the</b> archaeological resources <b>of</b> New Mexico Territory required preservation. He was also criticized for an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to pedagogy—a euphemism for his enthusiasm for taking students into the field (at the Pajarito Plateau) at summer camps, a highly innovative practice at the time and one that reinforced the concerns that his critics had about his enthusiasm for preserving the sites there. Particularly contentious was the fact that he included women in his field camps. By early 1903 he was pressured out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president's office. Hewett is the namesake for buildings at today's New Mexico Highlands University.|$|R
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E

Mowry had recently {{retired from the}} Army at Fort Yuma, and was twice elected as delegate to Washington for <b>the</b> proposed territory <b>of</b> Arizona, but Congress, not recognizing Arizona as an organized territory, refused to seat him. Cross and Mowry, who agreed on their aspirations for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> Arizona, but represented rival mining interests, settled their differences in a bloodless duel on 8 July 1859.|$|R
500|$|Bond disobeys M's {{order and}} travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Marco belonged to an {{organisation}} of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate {{a meeting to}} select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for [...] "the Pale King" [...] to be assassinated, Bond escapes the meeting and is pursued across the city by the organization's assassin, Mr. Hinx. Moneypenny informs Bond that the Pale King is Mr. White, a former member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization's subsidiary Quantum.

50|$|According to {{controversial}} radiocarbon dates, Corded Ware ceramic {{forms in}} single graves develop {{earlier in the}} area that is now Poland than in western and southern Central Europe. The earliest radiocarbon dates for Corded Ware indeed come from Kujawy and Lesser Poland in central and southern Poland and point to the period around 3000 BCE. However, subsequent review has challenged this perspective, instead pointing out that the wide variation in dating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corded Ware, especially <b>the</b> dating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> culture's beginning, is based on individual outlier graves, is not particularly in line with other archaeological data and runs <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> plateaus in <b>the</b> radiocarbon calibration curve; in the one case where the dating can be clarified with dendrochronology, in Switzerland, Corded Ware is found for only a short period from 2750 BCE to 2400 BCE.|$|R
25|$|On December 23, 2009, William J. Kelly, {{conservative}} {{activist and}} candidate for Illinois Comptroller, attempted {{to remove a}} FFRF sign at a holiday display.

5|$|Pursuant to dynastic imperatives and <b>the</b> ethos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, {{the nobles}} {{required}} Tamar to marry {{in order to}} have a leader for the army and to provide an heir to the throne. Their choice fell on Yuri, son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murdered prince Andrei I Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal, who then lived as a refugee among <b>the</b> Kipchaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Caucasus. The choice was approved by Tamar's aunt Rusudan and the prince was brought to Georgia to marry the queen in 1185. Yuri proved to be an able soldier, but a difficult person and he soon ran <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> his wife. <b>The</b> strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at the royal court in which Tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant. The turning point in Tamar's fortunes came with <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful Catholicos-Patriarch Michael whom the queen replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze. Tamar gradually expanded her own power-base and elevated her loyal nobles to high positions at the court, most notably the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} a concern in the {{administration}} over whether {{the use of military}} forces to support and carry out the evacuation was permitted under the newly passed War Powers Act.

25|$|Schlesinger and Warner Bros. had {{problems}} with Clean Pastures from the start.

40|$|Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s {{initiative}} {{process is}} unique—Alaska {{is the only}} state with a robust initiative culture and advance oversight over <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> initiatives by <b>the</b> Lieutenant Governor. This state of affairs is appropriate because it recognizes both the savings to the state and the benefit to citizens that advance oversight can achieve. It also places <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> advance oversight in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual most qualified in Alaska to wield it. However, despite being generally commendable, the Alaskan initiative oversight process is not perfect. Because the Lieutenant Governor has this unique power, it is inappropriate for them to be elected on the same ticket with the Governor. This Note proposes that the Lieutenant Governor and Governor positions should be more distinct, by holding separate elections for the two offices and by establishing a standardized line <b>of</b> succession to <b>the</b> fill vacancies in <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lieutenant Governor. On the way to this conclusion, this Note discusses a number of factors that should be considered before any change to the initiative process is made.
