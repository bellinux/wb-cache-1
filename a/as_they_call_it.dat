25|$|Territorial {{expansion}} of the Luhya people (the western neighbours of the Terik) has strained Terik-Luhyia relations during the last decades. Luhya are felt {{to be a threat}} to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The {{expansion of}} the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because they were afraid of the Luhya.|$|E
500|$|I {{perceived}} that that teaching {{which is our}} salvation was to be had in a much purer and more lively form if sought at the fountain-head and drawn from the actual sources than from pools and runnels. And so I have revised the whole New Testament (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> against the standard of the Greek original... I have added annotations of my own, in order {{in the first place}} to show the reader what changes I have made, and why; second, to disentangle and explain anything that may be complicated, ambiguous, or obscure.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was work}} for the Stanton girls at the [...] "film factory," [...] <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> next morning, so they had left the hotel before Mr. Merrick's party {{assembled}} at the breakfast table.|$|R

60|$|She {{remembered it}} all so well! This rocking of the arms, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> was {{a trick of}} hers that {{signified}} sudden joy or pain. They hung rigid by her side, and then shook violently with emotion.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{even have}} {{recurring}} nightmares that I'm in my cell at Abu Ghraib, cell 49 <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> being tortured {{at the hands}} of the people of a great nation that carries the torch of freedom and human rights," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|I {{forgot to}} mention, that the gentlemen that played gave a hundred guineas to the box, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> {{and at the}} end of their play they asked for my gentlewoman of the bedchamber, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> her (Mrs. Amy, forsooth), and gave it her, and gave twenty guineas more among the servants.|$|R

60|$|All {{the rest}} joining in, and seeming {{unanimous}} in the opinion, {{that it was}} high {{time for me to}} be stirring myself, and doing boy's business, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> I made no more ado, but jumped into the rigging.

60|$|It {{was near}} {{an hour from}} the first flash, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> before <b>they</b> could get all things ready; but then they fired two rockets from the {{adjoining}} hill, soon after one another, and, after that, at about ten minutes' distance of time, a third, which was just as by agreement, and was perfectly understood, the rockets performing extremely well.|$|R
60|$|The Parliament, {{sensible}} of this, {{and receiving}} daily {{accounts of the}} progress we made, began to cool a little in their temper, abated of their first rage, and voted an address for peace; {{and sent to the}} king to let him know they were desirous to prevent the effusion of more blood, and to bring things to an accommodation, or, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> a right understanding.|$|R
