25|$|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin died in New York City, {{where he}} was in {{residence}} at the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue. On March 15, 1955, {{at the house of}} his diplomat cousin Jean de Lagarde, Teilhard told friends he hoped he would die on Easter Sunday. In the Easter Sunday evening of April 10, 1955, during an animated discussion at the apartment of Rhoda de Terra, his personal assistant since 1949, the 73-year-old priest suffered a heart attack; regaining consciousness for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>he</b> died a few minutes later. He was buried in the cemetery for the New York Province of the Jesuits at the Jesuit novitiate, St. Andrew-on-Hudson in Hyde Park, New York.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E

Pausing for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, Sarah: [...] "I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory." ...|$|E

60|$|He didn't {{raise his}} tone, {{and there was}} in it more of sorrow than of indignation. The banker turned an ashen gray.. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> elapsed before <b>he</b> spoke, <b>a</b> {{transforming}} <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> suddenly became ice.|$|R
500|$|When the {{helicopter}} arrives, {{it contains a}} wounded soldier, which occupies Hawkeye and Trapper; they say their short goodbyes before going {{to care for the}} soldier. Beginning to board {{the helicopter}}, Henry spots an emotional Radar saluting him and pauses for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>He</b> runs back to him to return the salute, hug him, and leave him with the words: [...] "You behave yourself, or I'm gonna come back and kick your butt." [...] Blake then boards the helicopter and leaves the 4077th.|$|E
500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Millennium" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the entry [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "visually captivating", particularly praising the installment's [...] "use {{of light and}} dark symbolism". Ultimately, he noted that [...] "it's good to once again see Mulder and Scully temporarily set free from the show's overarching conspiracy." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "there were a lot of big, big things going on in this ep , starting with Millenniums ace profiler Frank Black [...] reluctantly helping Mulder and Scully solve the apparent suicides of four FBI agents." [...] Rosell ultimately concluded that the reason the episode was a success was due to Mulder and Scully's kiss, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> called [...] "inevitable" [...] although he did note that [...] "many think [...] really signaled the beginning of the end." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review and called it [...] "highly entertaining" [...] and [...] "cause for celebration". He noted that, while he had never seen an episode of Millennium, the series mythology and story-arcs [...] "integrated seamlessly into this episode" [...] in a way that non-Millennium fans could still enjoy it. John Drake of Xposé considered the episode [...] "excellent" [...] and rated it 5 stars out of 5. Drake commended Lance Henriksen's performance, saying that [...] "not only provides continuity with Millennium, but adds a new dimension as Frank tries to leave the wreckage of his professional life behind". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". He called the entry [...] "tired" [...] and wrote that it was [...] "both too ambitious and not epic enough" [...] to bring closure to Millennium. Furthermore, he felt that the story's basic plot was too confusing and almost laughable. Despite this, he enjoyed Johnson's role as the villain, calling him [...] "interesting", and he wrote that the scene with Mulder and Black in the cellar was [...] "kind of cool" [...] because of the [...] "creepy zombie sequences".|$|E

But Jorg enters to give him the news that he has tracked down Raffaele who will be returning to the castle. Stankar rejoices (O gioia inesprimibile, che questo core inondi! - [...] "Oh, the inexpressible joy that floods this heart of mine!"), as he sees revenge being within reach. He leaves.|$|E
2500|$|At Bash at the Beach, Hall and Nash were {{scheduled}} to team with their mystery partner against Lex Luger, Randy Savage and Sting. At {{the onset of the}} match, Hall and Nash came out without a third man, telling [...] "Mean Gene" [...] Okerlund that he was [...] "in the building," [...] but that they did not need him yet. Shortly into the match, a Stinger Splash resulted in Luger being crushed behind Kevin Nash, and being taken away on a stretcher, reducing the match to The Outsiders vs. Sting and Savage. Hall and Nash took control of the match when Hulk Hogan came to the ring. After standing off with The Outsiders for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>he</b> suddenly leg dropped Savage, showing himself to be the Outsiders' mysterious third man. Giving an interview with Okerlund directly after the match, Hogan claimed the reason for the turn was that he was tired of fans that had turned on him. Hogan labeled the new faction [...] "the new world order of wrestling", beginning a feud between wrestlers loyal to WCW and the nWo. The fans in attendance were so outraged at Hogan's betrayal that they pelted the ring with debris, such as paper cups and plastic bottles, for the duration of his interview. One fan even jumped the security railing and tried to attack Hogan in the ring, but was swiftly subdued by Hall, Nash, and arena security.|$|E
