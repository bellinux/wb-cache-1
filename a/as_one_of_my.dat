It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> top ten films, period." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa have {{admitted}} they were [...] "not computer literate", and felt {{this was a}} detriment to their writing. Gordon was disappointed in the episode, stating that it [...] "still qualifies <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> biggest disappointments", ranking it as the worst episode of the first season. Glen Morgan felt that [...] "parts of the episode worked. What maybe fell a little flat {{is that we were}} a little too afraid of doing HAL and, in a sense, I think that's what the building needed; to have a scary personality." [...] James Wong had mixed feelings, saying that the episode [...] "had some neat stuff at the end...although I think the ending was a little unsatisfying to me visually, as well as in terms of how Mulder comes to dismember the machine. Overall a fun episode." [...] Chris Carter was more supportive of the episode, stating that the script addressed the question of what made up an X-File, and that it doesn't always have to be paranormal. He also felt positive about the episode's action scenes.|$|E

500|$|... "Dwight Christmas" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} story editor Robert Padnick, marking his fourth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season. It was directed by Charles McDougall, his first directing credit for the season. McDougal's first job for the series was directing its first Christmas episode during the show's second season. The basic plot of the episode, involving Belsnickel, had originally been conceived during the writing for fourth season {{and was going to}} air as that year's Christmas installment. However, the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike halted production, and the unfinished script was never used. According to executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels, the writing staff wanted to use the premise for many years, but could never find a right time to implement it, until an opportunity during the show's last season presented itself. Before the episode aired, Kemper, in an interview with TV Guide said that [...] "I feel like I might be expected to say this because it is the last one, but I truly love this episode so much" [...] and that she [...] "specifically love Dwight's storyline" [...] because [...] "he brings in his family Christmas traditions. I've always held Dwight <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite characters and now 'Dwight Christmas' just takes it to a new level." [...] Fischer said that filming the last Christmas episode was [...] "emotional" [...] and regretted not being able to have Mindy Kaling, who portrayed Kelly Kapoor on the series, film a karaoke scene. This is the second episode of season nine to not feature Andy or Clark. Ed Helms, who portrayed Andy, left the show temporarily in the season's sixth episode [...] "The Boat" [...] in order to film The Hangover Part III, whereas Clark Duke, who portrayed Clark, left for a few episodes to film Kick-Ass 2.|$|E

Before the raid, Ling Tong led 3,000 troops to engage the enemy and duelled with Zhang Liao before {{he was ordered to}} retreat. When Gan Ning saw that, he told Sun Quan, [...] "Tonight I'll bring only 100 men to raid Cao Cao's camp. If I lose a single soldier, this will not count <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> contributions." [...] That night, he led 100 horsemen to attack Cao Cao's camp and all of them returned alive after inflicting damage and casualties on the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|When Sedgwick visited Paris {{at the end}} of 1826 {{he found}} hostility to Diluvialism: Alexander von Humboldt {{ridiculed}} it [...] "beyond measure", and Louis-Constant Prévost [...] "lectured against it". In the summer of 1827 Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison travelled to investigate the geology of the Scottish Highlands, where they found [...] "so many indications of local diluvial operations" [...] that Sedgwick began to change his mind about it being worldwide. When George Poulett Scrope published his investigations into the Auvergne in 1827, he did not use the term [...] "diluvium". He was followed by Murchison and Charles Lyell whose account appeared in 1829. All three agreed that the valleys could well have been formed by rivers acting over a long time, and a deluge was not needed. Lyell, formerly a pupil of Buckland, put strong arguments against diluvialism in the first volume of his Principles of Geology published in 1830, though suggesting the possibility of a deluge affecting a region such as the low-lying area around the Caspian Sea. Sedgwick responded to this book in his presidential address to the Geological Society in February 1830, agreeing that diluvial deposits had formed at differing times. At the society a year later, when retiring from the presidency, Sedgwick described his former belief that [...] "vast masses of diluvial gravel" [...] had been scattered worldwide in [...] "one violent and transitory period" [...] as [...] "a most unwarranted conclusion", and therefore thought [...] "it right, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> last acts before I quit this Chair, thus publicly to read my recantation." [...] However, he remained convinced that a flood as described in Genesis was not excluded by geology.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was glad}} of that smile, and proceeded. [...] "You will {{let me speak}} to you, <b>as</b> to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own girls? To them, I should say, use the only true cure. Don't brood over vexations, small or great, but {{think of them as}} trials that, borne bravely, become blessings." ...|$|R

Crown Hall is considered architecturally significant because Mies van der Rohe refined the basic steel and glass construction style, beautifully capturing simplicity and openness. While designing Crown Hall, Mies stayed true to his famous words, [...] "less is more" [...] and he considered the building {{to be the best}} embodiment <b>of</b> that maxim. <b>Mies</b> once described his creation as being [...] "almost nothing." [...] With World War II and the Great Depression leaving a large break in construction, Mies reconstructed curriculum to appreciate minimalism and to focus on using only what was necessary; an approach not yet favorable in most architecture schools of the time.|$|R

2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
