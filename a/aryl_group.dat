25|$|Pyrroles can be {{prepared}} by silver-catalyzed cyclization of alkynes with isonitriles, where R2 is an electron-withdrawing group, and R1 is an alkane, <b>aryl</b> <b>group,</b> or ester. Examples of disubstituted alkynes have also been seen to form the desired pyrrole in considerable yield. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a silver acetylide intermediate. This method {{is analogous to the}} azide–alkyne click chemistry used to form azoles.|$|E
25|$|In a {{rearrangement}} reaction, {{the carbon}} {{skeleton of a}} molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. These include hydride shift reactions such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, where a hydrogen, alkyl or <b>aryl</b> <b>group</b> migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon. Most rearrangements {{are associated with the}} breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. Other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the Cope rearrangement.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the most}} common {{aromatic}} compounds are derivatives of benzene (an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleum and its distillates), the word “aromatic” occasionally refers informally to benzene derivatives, {{and so it was}} first defined. Nevertheless, many non-benzene aromatic compounds exist. In living organisms, for example, {{the most common}} aromatic rings are the double-ringed bases in RNA and DNA. An aromatic functional group or other substituent is called an <b>aryl</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a related}} reaction, alkyl halides undergo {{nucleophilic}} displacement by phenoxides. The R–X {{cannot be used}} to react with the alcohol. However, phenols {{can be used to}} replace the alcohol, while maintaining the alkyl halide. Since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong base like sodium hydroxide to form phenoxide ions. The phenoxide ion will then substitute the –X group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an <b>aryl</b> <b>group</b> attached to it in a reaction with an SN2 mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The use of cation-pi {{interactions}} {{has also}} been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies {{can be used to}} effect enantioselective cationic polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated polyene cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and stereoselectivity. The enantioselectivity correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the <b>aryl</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an alkoxy group. The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an <b>aryl</b> <b>group.</b> Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E
25|$|A boronic acid is a {{compound}} related to boric acid {{in which one}} of the three hydroxyl groups is replaced by an alkyl or <b>aryl</b> <b>group.</b> As {{a compound}} containing a carbon–boron bond, members of this class thus belong to the larger class of organoboranes. Boronic acids act as Lewis acids. Their unique feature is that they are capable of forming reversible covalent complexes with sugars, amino acids, hydroxamic acids, etc. (molecules with vicinal, (1,2) or occasionally (1,3) substituted Lewis base donors (alcohol, amine, carboxylate)). The pKa of a boronic acid is ~9, but they can form tetrahedral boronate complexes with pKa ~7. They are occasionally used in the area of molecular recognition to bind to saccharides for fluorescent detection or selective transport of saccharides across membranes.|$|E
500|$|The oxazolidinone pharmacophore—the {{chemical}} [...] "template" [...] {{essential for}} antimicrobial activity—consists of a 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one moiety with an <b>aryl</b> <b>group</b> at position 3 and an S-methyl group, with another substituent attached to it, at position 5 (the R-enantiomers of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In {{addition to this}} essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An acetamide substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used {{in all of the}} more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some isosteric groups are used. A fluorine atom at the 3′ position practically doubles in vitro and in vivo activity, and the electron-donating nitrogen atom in the morpholine ring helps maintain high antibiotic potency and an acceptable safety profile.|$|E

2500|$|The {{search for}} {{selective}} and potent α7 nAChR agonists {{has produced a}} series of compounds that have good potential as drug candidates. One such search produced SEN12333/WAY-317538 among other compounds that have desirable pharmacokinetic profiles and are selective of α7 nAChRs over α1, α3 and α4β2 nAChRs. Structure activity relationships for these compounds have been proposed. The optimal pharmacophore of α7 nAChR agonist is made of three parts. There is a basic moiety connected to a carbon chain linked to an aromatic moiety by an amide bridge. [...] The amide bridge can be inverted without affecting the potency of the agonist. [...] A biaryl group shows more potency than a monoaryl group as the aromatic moiety and substitution at position 2 on the later <b>aryl</b> <b>group</b> will further increase the potency. Potency is higher for agonists with H+ donor/acceptor on the later <b>aryl</b> <b>group</b> on the biaryl group. A high number of hydrogen bond acceptors could decrease permeability across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) due to the polar surface area {{and needs to be}} taken into account when designing agonists to target α7 nAChRs.|$|E
50|$|It is of {{considerable}} interest {{that when one}} of the aryl groups has a para-cyano or para-methoxy group, that substituted <b>aryl</b> <b>group</b> migrates in preference.
