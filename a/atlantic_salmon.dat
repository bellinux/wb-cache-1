5|$|The direct {{environmental}} and economic impacts of introduced C. mutica populations remain unknown. They provide valuable food sources for larger predators, particularly fish. In New Zealand, for example, they {{have become part of}} the diet of the native big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis). In Europe, wild and farmed fish like the common dab (Limanda limanda), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar), consume large amounts of non-native C. mutica.|$|E

50|$|After the {{construction}} of dams on the Oswego River, which carries the outflow of Oneida Lake (the Oneida River) to Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence River and the <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, <b>salmon</b> disappeared from Fish Creek, although they were reintroduced in 1997.|$|R
5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon,</b> vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon).</b> In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine {{species of}} fresh water fish are {{recognized}} on the territory of peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and European perch. The rivers are an important habitat for the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon,</b> which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, {{with a number of}} remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider, is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea.|$|E

NAFO continues ICNAF's legacy under a mandate of providing scientific advice to member states with the premise of ensuring the conservation and management of fish stocks in the region. The NAFO mandate includes most fishery resources in the Northwest <b>Atlantic,</b> except <b>salmon,</b> tunas/marlins, whales, and sedentary species (e.g. shellfish).|$|R
25|$|The {{commercial}} salmon {{fisheries in}} California have been either severely curtailed or closed completely in recent years, due to critically low returns on the Klamath and or Sacramento rivers, causing {{millions of dollars}} in losses to commercial fishermen.

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon,</b> brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Mountain hare (apparently {{absent from}} Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now {{abundant}} and predated on by wild cat and pine marten. Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
50|$|Muddler {{patterns}} are generally effective when fishing for any freshwater or saltwater species in cold or warm water environments.

50|$|The Rocky River has a {{man-made}} salmon ladder spanning the 8 m waterfalls at its mouth. Originally not a salmon river {{because of those}} falls, the river was seeded with salmon fry in the mid-1980s. The salmon began using the man-made ladder to bypass the falls in 1987. In 2002, the river opened to recreational anglers, making it <b>Atlantic</b> Canada's newest <b>salmon</b> river.|$|R
25|$|Globally, Chile is {{the only}} country other than New Zealand {{currently}} producing significant quantities of farmed Chinook salmon. The United States has not produced farmed Chinook in commercial quantities since 1994. New Zealand will likely remain the major producer of the species as other countries' (predominantly Norway, Canada and the United Kingdom) salmon productions are focused typically on other species such as <b>Atlantic</b> and coho <b>salmon.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{stocking}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> resumed in the Salmon River in 1995. Small returns {{several years}} later established a limited summer fishery.

40|$|Abstract Background Growth hormone (GH) is an {{important}} regulator of skeletal growth, {{as well as other}} adapted processes in salmonids. The GH gene (gh) in salmonids is represented by duplicated, non-allelic isoforms designated as gh 1 and gh 2. We have isolated and characterized gh -containing bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) of both <b>Atlantic</b> and Chinook <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in order to further elucidate our understanding of the conservation and regulation of these loci. Results BACs containing gh 1 and gh 2 from both <b>Atlantic</b> and Chinook <b>salmon</b> were assembled, annotated, and compared to each other in their coding, intronic, regulatory, and flanking regions. These BACs also contain the genes for skeletal muscle sodium channel oriented in the same direction. The sequences of the genes for interferon alpha- 1, myosin alkali light chain and microtubule associated protein Tau were also identified, and found in opposite orientations relative to gh 1 and gh 2. Viability of each of these genes was examined by PCR. We show that transposon insertions have occurred differently in the promoters of gh, within and between each species. Other differences within the promoters and intronic and 3 '-flanking regions of the four gh genes provide evidence that they have distinct regulatory modes and possibly act to function differently and/or during different times of salmonid development. Conclusion A core proximal promoter for transcription of both gh 1 and gh 2 is conserved between the two species of salmon. Nevertheless, transposon integration and regulatory element differences do exist between the promoters of gh 1 and gh 2. Additionally, organization of transposon families into the BACs containing gh 1 and for the BACs containing gh 2, are very similar within orthologous regions, but much less clear conservation is apparent in comparisons between the gh 1 - and gh 2 -containing paralogous BACs for the two fish species. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a burst of transposition activity occurred during the speciation events which led to <b>Atlantic</b> and Pacific <b>salmon.</b> The Chinook and other Oncorhynchus GH 1 s are strikingly different in comparison to the other GHs and this change is not apparent in the surrounding non-coding sequences. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{fish species}} serve as vectors {{for the disease}} and have {{subsequently}} spread the pathogen {{to other parts of}} the world. [...] An example is the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) which is responsible for the spread of redmouth disease to trout in Europe. [...] Other vectors include the goldfish (Carassius auratus), <b>Atlantic</b> and Pacific <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar), the emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), and farmed whitefish (Coregonus spp.). Infections have also occurred in farmed turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and seabream (Sparus auratus).

5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile <b>Atlantic</b> and Pacific <b>salmon,</b> herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|R
25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, <b>Atlantic</b> and Chinook <b>salmon,</b> redfin perch, common carp, and mosquitofish, {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish. It {{has been linked to}} declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|R
