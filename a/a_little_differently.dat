25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>differently</b> than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E
25|$|Velvet worms are {{segmented}} {{animals with}} a flattened cylindrical body cross-section {{and rows of}} unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20cm (.2 to 8in), with the average being about 5cm (2 in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin s, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>differently</b> from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.|$|E

500|$|In {{original}} {{performances of}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{the actor who}} played Egeus and the actor who played Philostrate were probably one and the same. This can be gathered through discrepancies between the First Folio and earlier quarto versions of the play. In Act V, scene 1, for example, the quartos say [...] "Call Philostrate" [...] in several places where the 1623 Folio says [...] "Call Egeus". This would be an easy mistake to make if one actor had spoken both parts in this scene. One actor filling both roles explains the jumbled dialogue in this scene. Howard Furness, editor of several Shakespeare editions, interprets this <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>differently,</b> saying that Shakespeare may not have originally intended both roles to be played by the same person, but that directors combined the roles to save money. In any case, Act V, scene 1 is the only scene in which both men are present at the same time. In cases where one actor was playing both roles, Egeus' character would probably have filled both roles in this scene, absorbing Philostrate's lines into his own.|$|E

[...] Jackson also felt that the couple's relationship was crucial to Lucky's growth and acceptance of his parents, stating to Soaps In Depth in 1999: [...] "I think it was through that relationship and that love that Lucky obtained a sense of peace that made him want to mend things with his parents more.

Working with requirements is not an easy thing and their poor understanding and incorrect implementation may adversely affect the project. Dissatisfaction arises at the both sides of project because customers do not get what they have wanted and development team does worthless and unnecessary work from their point of view. Problems with requirements and with setting up the right processes to deal with them are the area of Requirements Management. Over the years there was defined a few best practices within this scope. This thesis describes some basic techniques, methods and rules. There is also a requirements splitting into five types.

40|$|Our {{lives would}} not be what they are today without animals. From the food we eat, to the clothes we wear, animals provide {{tangible}} evidence of their importance every day. But more than that, animals have shaped {{who we are and}} what we believe. Often in ways we don 2 ̆ 7 t see. That 2 ̆ 7 s what inspired me to write Being Human. This work began as an examination of how humans have altered animals to better match our imaginations and ideals, and too, the way these animals have irrecoverably altered how we live and look at the world. Consider, for example, that before they became physically useful to us in providing meat or skills or companionship, animals were central figures in our stories, mythologies, and religions. All the while, of course, these animals remained both ignorant and at the mercy of whatever we imagined [...] or needed [...] them to be. And what does all of this say about us? What can we learn about ourselves from looking at animals, and more specifically, looking at the way we treat them? In a society where animal flesh comes to us freshly packed and cleanly saran-wrapped, and pets are treated as members of our families, we tend to look at animals as one thing or another. A farm pig is not a companion animal, any more than a cat is a meal-in-waiting. At least not in our culture. We generally see what 2 ̆ 7 s convenient or desirable and when things get messy or complicated, we tend to look away. In so doing, we miss the opportunity to clearly see who we really are, what we 2 ̆ 7 re capable of, and what, if anything, we might want to change as a result. I chose four specific animals that show us different sides of ourselves. These beings are both familiar and strange, part of our everyday lives but often only found on the periphery. Each animal symbolizes one of four categories: food, pest, worker and pet. And each connects to a human need: pigs with consumption, pigeons with communication, horses with control and cats with companionship. They are arranged in this order to reflect the deepening complexity of their respective human needs [...] from the simplest, the need to eat, to the most complex, the need for companionship. (Arguably, control can be considered the most complex, however I chose companionship as the culminating need because it inherently involves all of the other three.) I hope if I accomplish only one thing, it is this: after reading, you see these animals [...] and your relationship to them [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>differently</b> than before...|$|R
