5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the iconography of classical art mapped the reality of classical society.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological and iconographical {{evidence}} provide <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> {{of perspectives}} than literature.

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds.

5|$|In 2007–2008, the {{promenade}} hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at the smaller Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G. Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly bunched. He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist unfettered to choose from <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of pieces.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings {{can serve as a}} good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|Social rodents have <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of vocalizations than do solitary species.

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless modem company to one that also produces <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> of hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products.
