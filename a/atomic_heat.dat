In 1815 he {{interrupted}} his studies at Berlin {{to serve as a}} volunteer in the Hundred Days against Napoleon, and was wounded in the Battle of Ligny. Subsequently he entered Berlin University as a student of theology, but soon turned to scientific subjects. His earlier papers were mostly concerned with crystallography, and the reputation they gained him led to his appointment as Privatdozent at the University of Königsberg, where in 1828 he became extraordinary, and in 1829 ordinary, professor of mineralogy and physics. His 1831 study on the specific heats of compounds included what is now known as Neumann's Law: the molecular heat of a compound is equal to the sum of the <b>atomic</b> <b>heats</b> of its constituents.|$|R

Mechagodzilla is teamed up with the dinosaur Titanosaurus, who is controlled by Katsura's crazed father. Although Mechagodzilla survives another decapitation during a battle against Godzilla, it is once more defeated after Katsura commits suicide, destroying the robot's controls and freezing it long enough for Godzilla to use its <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> ray on Mechagodzilla's headless body, causing it to explode.|$|E
50|$|Godzilla {{comes to}} the rescue, {{although}} it is outmatched by the two titans.

Interpol agents infiltrate the aliens' hideout, rescue Ichinose, and kill Mafune and many of the aliens. The remaining aliens attempt to escape in their ships, but Godzilla shoots them down with his <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> ray. Katsura, while being embraced by Ichinose, shoots herself to destroy Mechagodzilla 2's control device (which had been implanted in her body by the aliens). This helps Godzilla destroy the robot.

The JSDF erects microwave-emitting plates during an artificial thunderstorm, hitting Godzilla with lightning and heating up its body temperature during a battle in the mountains outside Osaka. Godzilla is only moderately affected, but Biollante arrives to engage it in battle once again. The fight ends after Godzilla fires its <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> ray inside Biollante's mouth. An exhausted Godzilla collapses on the beach, and Biollante disintegrates into the sky, forming an image of Erika amongst the stars. Shiragami, watching the scene, is killed by SSS9.

The source is based on an Erbium Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) source that seeds a high power Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA). The main {{interest}} of this source is its very low coherence length, thus allowing an incoherent superposition of several trapping beams without any optical interference. The behavior of the superimposed beams is then a scalar sum greatly simplifying complex configurations.

50|$|The {{original}} climax for Mothra {{was entirely}} {{different from what}} {{ended up in the}} final print. Originally, Nelson and his group had planned to kidnap Shinji Chujo {{for a longer period of}} time, rather than leaving him tied up as they fled the country. Instead, they took the small boy on a private plane as they attempted to flee, only to accidentally crash near a mountainside. Meanwhile, the film's heroes are in close pursuit, having brought along the authorities to help save the boy. All of this takes place while Mothra is still in its cocoon, meaning that Fukuda and the others weren't originally planned to witness the birth of Mothra's adult form. Instead they give chase to Nelson as Mothra breaks free after the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Heat</b> Ray Gun attack.

Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah features a robotic version - Mecha-King Ghidorah - equipped with grappling cables and a mechanical arm that can discharge electricity and is capable of lifting Godzilla. In Rebirth of Mothra III, King Ghidorah gains energy from eating victims and can construct a dome to house its victims for future consumption. It is also portrayed as capable of firing lightning bolts from its wings and regenerating its entire body from severed body parts. Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack features a version that can electrocute enemies via its teeth and can gain power by absorbing the spirits of dead monsters, allowing it to form an energy shield capable of deflecting Godzilla's <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> ray.|$|E
50|$|The entropy of {{a system}} is another {{thermodynamic}} quantity that is not easily measured. However, {{using a combination of}} theoretical and experimental techniques, entropy can in fact be accurately estimated. At low temperatures, the Debye model leads to the result that the <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> capacity Cv for solids should be proportional to T3, and that for perfect crystalline solids it should become zero at absolute zero. Experimentally, the heat capacity is measured at temperature intervals to as low a temperature as possible. Values of Cp/T are plotted against T for the whole range of temperatures where the substance exists in the same physical state. The data are extrapolated from the lowest experimental temperature to 0 K using the Debye model. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystalline substance becomes zero at 0 K. When S0 is zero, the area under the curve from 0 K to any temperature gives the entropy at that temperature. Even though the Debye model contains Cv instead of Cp, {{the difference between the two}} at temperatures near 0 K is so small as to be negligible.|$|E

40|$|Morphology changes induced in {{polycrystalline}} silver catalysts as {{a result}} of heating in either oxygen, water or oxygen-methanol atmospheres have been investigated by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), FT-Raman spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The silver catalyst of interest consisted of two distinct particle types, one of which contained a significant concentration of sub-surface hydroxy species (in addition to surface adsorbed <b>atomic</b> oxygen). <b>Heating</b> the sample to 663 K resulted in the production of 'pin-holes' in the silver structure as a consequence of near-surface explosions caused by sub-surface hydroxy recombination. Furthermore, 'pin-holes' were predominantly found in the vicinity of surface defects, such as platelets and edge structures. Reaction between methanol and oxygen also resulted in the formation of 'pin-holes' in the silver surface, which were inherently associated with the catalytic process. A reaction mechanism is suggested that involves the interaction of methanol with sub-surface oxygen species to form sub-surface hydroxy groups. The sub-surface hydroxy species subsequently erupt through the silver surface to again produce 'pin-holes'...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{simulation}} methods {{based on}} density-functional theory are currently deemed unfit {{to cope with}} <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> transport within the Green-Kubo formalism, because quantum-mechanical energy densities and currents are inherently ill-defined at the atomic scale.

Based on these findings, we derive an expression for the adiabatic energy flux from density-functional theory, which allows heat transport to be simulated using ab-initio equilibrium molecular dynamics. Our methodology is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those of classical equilibrium and ab-initio non-equilibrium (Müller-Plathe) simulations for a liquid-Argon model, and finally applied to heavy water at ambient conditions.

40|$|SUMMARY: Foundations of the {{periodic}} {{system of the}} elements. The period 1816 - 1821 in history of chemistry has primarily been of great interest because of the foundations of {{the periodic}} system of the elements, which in the sixties of the last century would prove to become such a firm basis to inorganic chemistry. In this half a decade Döbereiner found the first triad of elements. Berzelius started with his accurate atomic weight determinations of the elements, and Dulong and Petit formulated their law on the constancy of the <b>atomic</b> <b>heat</b> of the elements, and Mitscherlich his law on isomorphism. Without these discoveries and investigations it should not have been possible to find the periodic system of the elements. The hypothesis on the prima materia, set up by Prout in 1816, really exercised only an indirect influence. As to the hypothesis of Avogadro, which Ampère, in 1816, formulated independently of him, its great essentialness was understood only several decades later...|$|E
