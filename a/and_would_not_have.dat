5|$|In December 2016, Sony Pictures {{announced}} a sequel for Spider-Man: Homecoming, {{scheduled to be}} released on July 5, 2019. In June 2017, Feige stated that the film would be titled {{in a similar fashion}} to Homecoming, using a subtitle, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a number in the title.|$|E
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E

5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the Germans {{had been unable to}} develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For the first time the Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that the Germans did not have nuclear weapons, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> them for some time.|$|E

5|$|In December 1995, Miceli {{signed with}} WCW, {{and as part}} of a storyline by booker Eric Bischoff, showed up on WCW Monday Nitro on December 18, where she threw the WWF Women's Title belt into a trash can. She later {{admitted}} that she regretted the action <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done it had Bischoff not coerced her. Miceli immediately began using the Madusa name again, and the company brought in Bull Nakano to feud with her; they battled in a match at Hog Wild in August 1996. Due to pre-match stipulations, Madusa was allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle after the match.|$|E
5|$|Paying {{money to}} enemy {{subjects}} – some of Speyer's friends had made claims at the Frankfurt bank for payment of sums {{due to them}} {{that were in the}} hands of Speyer in London. Speyer had authorised the payments, although this was not allowed by the wartime regulations. The committee commented that in similar circumstances it had shown leniency to others doing the same thing, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> attached great importance to the matter if it had stood alone.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> survived for long.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{also made}} {{preparations}} in late 1942 {{for the movement}} of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at Singapore and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near Aden, this was judged to be unacceptably risky, especially as it was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret. Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one capital ship to protect troop convoys in this region, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been accepted by the Australian government. In November, the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.|$|E
5|$|The president's {{term was}} marked by {{disputes}} concerning the country's role, if any, in the expanding conflict in Europe, where Britain and France were at war. Hamilton and the Federalists supported Britain, while Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans favored France. The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss. When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the European war. The intense battle over the Jay Treaty in 1795 had previously polarized politics throughout the nation. The French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Nevertheless, most Americans were initially pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolutionary War, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sufficiently rallied behind anyone to stop France. On May 16, Adams gave {{a speech to the}} House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France. For this he was roundly derided in the Republican press.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, seeking {{support of}} her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile. Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, an {{investigation}} of his uncle's death took place, {{and a number of}} his Pande enemies were massacred. As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison. By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed prime minister; but after a year in power, he alienated both the King and the Queen by supporting Surendra's claim over the throne. On May 17, 1845, he was assassinated, on both the King and Queen's orders, by his nephew, Jang Bahadur Kunwar. The death of Mathabar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for Kot massacre and the establishment of Rana Dynasty, a dictatorship of hereditary prime ministers, which was founded on the basic template provided by Bhimsen Thapa. These events provided the long period of stability the country needed but at the cost of political and economic development.|$|E

25|$|However, {{despite the}} fact that the papyrus is in the form of a letter to the vizier, it was {{probably}} just a personal copy.

In addition, such a letter would be in the archives of the Vizier, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made their way into the hands of Henry Salt.|$|E
