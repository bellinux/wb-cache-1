500|$|In 2011, Allistair Pinsof at Destructoid {{reviewed}} the game, {{calling it a}} mix between Paperboy and Muscle March {{in terms of the}} complexity and pace, and compared the gameplay to Crash Bandicoot. He found it to be [...] "such a gloriously twisted, charming spectacle" [...] that it would be difficult not to like it; he said that the main reason to play the game is [...] "the sheer lunacy" [...] of it, saying that the game is [...] "obsessed" [...] with America, and portrays Americans as [...] "unhygienic hillbillies" [...] in a manner that makes it unclear if it is a self-aware parody or not. He concluded that the game is funny, but not great, and that the ridiculous premise and its large amount of small details make the game [...] "charmingly brain-dead". In 2013, Justin Amirkhani at Complex included the game in a list of company-branded video games that [...] "didn't suck", saying that while the game's graphics had not aged well, it was mechanically very similar to Temple Run, which Amirkhani called his favorite iOS game.

40|$|Abstract—Despite our {{exposure}} to <b>advergames,</b> and studies about their effects, {{we know very}} little about {{the other side of the}} coin, i. e., <b>advergames</b> developers.

After deriving statements concerning the <b>advergames</b> market through three interviews, we cross-validate these statements with eight companies. Several statements are statistically significant, including the following: <b>advergames</b> are increasingly becoming cross-platform; the technological platforms for developing <b>advergames</b> have changed considerably; an increasing number of clients demand social media components in their advergames; budgets for <b>advergames</b> will increase; the intermediary role of advertising companies will become less prominent; companies will make more strategic choices regarding advergames; <b>advergames</b> that can be played for an extended period of time will become more popular and ensure customer loyalty.

Similar fates befell the XBLA version of Double Dragon when its publisher went under. Yaris was an <b>advergame</b> that was pulled from the system after a year due to avoid it becoming stale content.

40|$|<b>Advergames</b> are {{increasingly}} being used {{as part of a}} marketing campaign to promote products and brands. Previous research investigating the extent to which game players absorb messages in interactive environments has focused on video and more general online gaming environments. Using a snowball sampling technique we examined the level of recall of products, brands, and companies in <b>advergames</b> and whether the acceptability of product placement in <b>advergames</b> is related to attitude towards advertising in general. Our investigation shows recall of products and companies is high and that being negative about advertising in general has a stronger influence on attitude towards product placement in <b>advergames</b> than being positive about advertising. We conclude that <b>advergames</b> might work more effectively for products and brands that are already known to the game players and that <b>advergames</b> may be more suited to enhancing and altering brand impression rather than building awareness of products that are new to the target audience...|$|R

5000|$|The youth {{market has}} become {{expansive}} and thus accelerates economic growth around the world. It {{is estimated that}} approximately $250 billion per annum is spent by youth aged between 2 and 17 years old. Moreover, an additional $500 billion is spent by households wholly for youth {{between the ages of}} 2 to 14. Recently, younger generations have begun to spend substantial amounts of time on the internet, coinciding with the increase in development of technology. For instance, in the US, the percentage of household computer ownership by youth, aged of 8 to 18, is 93 percent. In addition, 84 percent of those youth have access to the internet at home. Businesses are taking advantage of this trend and are creating new approaches toward advertising in order to reach to the youth market. This is a vast discipline within the marketing sector. <b>Advergames</b> are considered {{to be one of the}} most promising ways to reach out to the youth market. It consists of advertising and online gaming [...] [...] Its main purpose is to distribute information of the brand, product, and marketing messages to online users by integrating it into gaming process (An et al., 2014). Some of the advantages for using <b>advergames</b> are that the cost of delivering <b>advergames</b> is relatively inexpensive and few legal restrictions envelop them. Another advantage of <b>advergames</b> is that advertisers are able to gauge how long the user is involved with their brand games. This indicates that the use of <b>advergames</b> can simultaneously simplify the process of collecting data and save significant amounts of marketing costs. In contrast, there are some disadvantages of <b>advergames.</b> An example is that <b>advergames</b> are primarily created by fast food enterprises. Therefore, it leads to a concern that the ratio of child obesity might increase. This is because the majority of <b>advergames</b> users are children and they are easily persuaded to consume fast food because of their undeveloped processing types.|$|R

The outcome of the research can help deepenthe current knowledge of scholars and practitioners in their communication and brand buildingevolving <b>advergames</b> and the creation of customer engagement in this area. In order to gain more knowledge of online consumer engagement and <b>advergames,</b> numerousliterary sources were used such as: papers, articles, books, and annual reports of LEGO. Thecollected data is supported by a vary of interviews with employees of LEGO from differentdepartments. After analysis of the collected data and linking it to the theoretical framework numerousconclusions can be drawn to answer the initial research questions. First, the attributes thatstimulate <b>advergames</b> in creating online consumer engagement are the Unique SellingProposition (technical features such as: the technical platform, game type, dimensions, genre,prominence of advertising and congruity of brand and game) and the Emotional SellingProposition (representation elements such as audiovisual style, narration, procedural rhetoric). Currently, LEGO integrates digital games in their integrated marketing approach, linking themtightly connected to certain real life products. On the other hand, the importance of advergamesis growing as the study has identified that more and more company’s target customers (children) are moving towards digital entertainment specifically related to mobile technologies.
