The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> to each transmitter (vertex) must avoid interference which depends on the seperation each pair of vertices has. Two levels of interference are assumed in the problem we are concerned. Based on this channel assignment problem, we proposed a graph labelling problem which has two constraints instead of one.

40|$|The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{to radio}} {{transmitters}} in a mobile telecommunications network {{in such a}} way as to provide total coverage for a designated area is a problem of enormous interest to the telecommunications industry. This Frequency Assignment Problem has traditionally been modelled with binary constraints making it analogous to generalised graph colouring (A well known problem from discrete mathematics). In this paper we examine the use of non-binary high order constraints for the frequency assignment problem. The high order constraint representation allows small groups of interfering transmitters to be constrained by a single constraint that would have otherwise been constrained by a collection of binary constraints forming a clique. These higher order constraints are then solved by a high arity constraint solver. The results show that the application of high order constraints to the Frequency Assignment Problem introduces some flexibility at a local level that is not possib [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{telecommunication}} systems {{establish a}} large number of communication links with a limited number of available frequencies; reuse of the same or adjacent frequencies on neighboring links causes interference.

The algorithm iteratively solves an outer and an inner optimization problem. The outer problem decides for each pair of communication links which link gets the higher frequency and leads to an acyclic subdigraph problem with additional longest path restrictions.

The method is based on finding and storing the variable/value associations that lead to infeasible solutions. It allows the algorithm to dynamically manage the cuts of branches and the access to the decision variables. It is a learning system that progressively extends the algorithm knowledge on the problem and increases its effectiveness.

Constraint Programming is employed since currently applied heuristics aimed at interference minimization often fail for problems where it is problematic to obtain any feasible assignment. First, the focus is on feasibility problems only. Having determined valid solutions, it is also tried to explicitly minimize total interference. After the introduction of the underlying mathematical model, it is shown that the discussed version of FAP is strongly N P-hard.

40|$|Many {{space science}} {{experiments}} need an active isolation system {{to provide them}} with the requisite microgravity environment. The isolation systems planned for use with the International Space Station have been appropriately modeled using relative position, relative velocity, and acceleration states. In theory, frequency design filters can be applied to these state-space models, in order to develop optimal H, or mixed-norm controllers with desired stability- and performance characteristics. In practice. however, the kinematic coupling among the various states can lead, through the associated frequency-weighting-filters, to conflicting demands on the Riccati design "machinery. " The results can be numerically ill-conditioned regulator and estimator Riccati equations and/or reduced intuition in the design process. In addition, kinematic coupling can result in a redundancy in the demands imposed by the frequency weights. Failure properly to account for this type of coupling can lead to an unnecessary increase in controller dimensionality and, in turn, controller complexity.
