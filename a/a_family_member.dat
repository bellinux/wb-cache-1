The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> or a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Human {{disability}} {{is considered}} as a particularly important and significant social problem in the contemporary world. Disability most often results in reorganization of family structure. It is a new challenge faced by <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> to which they must adopt. The way with which <b>a</b> <b>family</b> deals depends on many factors, among other things, financial, living and cultural standards, a value system, relationships between <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Aim: The aim of this work was to show influence of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member’s</b> mobility impairment on its functioning, that is, financial situation, on existing family ties, social functioning. Study sample and method: A diagnostic survey method was used and original questionnaire form became its tool. The study sample consisted of 60 people, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> {{who served as a}} minder of a mobility-disabled person who made use of health care benefits and services in health care institutions in the area of Busko-Zdrój. Results: The survey analyses carried out, enabled to state that <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member’s</b> mobility impairment influenced changes in family functioning. Conclusions : 1. <b>A</b> <b>family</b> <b>member’s</b> mobility impairment influenced adversely the family’s financial situation causing <b>an</b> increase in <b>family</b> expenditures mainly on drug treatment, visits to specialists and rehabilitation. 2. <b>A</b> <b>family</b> <b>member’s</b> disability in most cases did not have a considerable influence on the change of family ties. In families in which there were some changes, they had a positive character and enhanced the existing <b>family</b> ties. 3. <b>A</b> <b>family</b> <b>member’s</b> disability influenced its social functioning in a different way.

During an interview with Hart, Lawler invited Diesel and his friend Shawn Michaels to confront Hart.

A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia.

5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. The letters were written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that the writer may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress.

5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day.

Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area.

5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> affected {{are more likely}} to get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>member.</b> Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E
