40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{on-going}} implementation of the Public Sector Information (PSI) directive in the Swedish National Archives. The directive {{is in line with}} current trends of opening up data for re-use, innovations and new digital services. The PSI directive has applied since 2003; the process of implementation is still, however, on-going, more or less successfully. We focus on the policy implementation process and analyse and discuss reasons why this process can be time-consuming and as a result, also delayed. Our findings build on research from a case study consisting of two projects that focussed on creating digital services based on archival material. We use a sociotechnical perspective as an analytical lens, and reason that the open data initiative clashes with the professional culture among archivists and the organizational culture found in <b>archives.</b> The mission <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> is reflected in its professional and organizational culture, and when these cultures (with related values, behaviours, artefacts and functions) are not in line with the intentions in a policy, the members of the organization need to reach a common understanding before a successful policy implementation can take place.

40|$|The {{drawings}} <b>archive</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{company is}} <b>an</b> important font <b>of</b> {{information that could}} be used during the design process. In fact, it is <b>a</b> collection <b>of</b> known and proven solutions to design problems and, also, the drawings include <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> information useful to design such as physical principles to achieve a function or solutions of particular machine design problems. The use of these data is however conditioned by easiness of access to the information. Normally, the drawings archive is not structured in a useful manner for the design and the retrieve of the information contained requires effort and time that are not often available to the designer. The use of database systems and informatics tools, as Product Data Management (PDM) or Product Life-cycle Management (PLM) systems, can allow company to add more attributes to the drawing during its storage, allowing a different access to the information. This work proposes an example about the organization of the information based on the functional structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product. The <b>organization</b> proposed was also used to catalogue the data stored in relation to the standards required to the product. This to demonstrate how much information is hided into the historical <b>archives</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company and how much it could be useful during the design process...|$|R
