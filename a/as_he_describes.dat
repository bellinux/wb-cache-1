5|$|By {{this stage}} Rome's entire {{position}} on the Rhine and even in Gaul was imperiled. Their civil war over, the Romans mustered a huge task force of eight legions (five dispatched from Italy, two from Spain and one from Britain) to deal with Civilis. Its commander Petillius Cerialis had to fight two difficult battles, at Trier and Xanten, before he could overrun the Batavi's homeland. Tacitus' surviving narrative breaks off <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> a meeting on {{an island in the}} Rhine delta between Civilis and Cerialis to discuss peace terms. We do not know the outcome of this meeting or Civilis' ultimate fate. But in view of his former friendship with Vespasian, who had already offered him a pardon, {{and the fact that the}} Romans still needed the Batavi levies, it is likely that the terms were lenient by Roman standards.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E

5|$|It {{turns out}} that the aliens are NBC {{executive}} Herb Goodman, played by Elliott Gould, and his associate Curtis, played by Garrett Morris. They announce that the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but nothing happens. Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de-activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him, but that does not work either. The executive confiscates Mr. Spock's pointed ears. Spock then mind-melds with Goodman only to discover that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> it, his brain is devoid of substance and contains only a few rodents.|$|E

500|$|So {{during an}} era when popular songs about war praised its heroism, Berlin instead gave voice to the subversive impulses shared by {{ordinary}} soldiers.

Without pious devotion to Christianity, but vaguely acknowledging Lutheranism's supposed offer to live a life <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>described,</b> Haller delicately explained to Hübbe his wish for a fast and secret conversion.|$|R
500|$|Fiasco, {{along with}} rappers Common, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, has been {{credited}} as {{a pioneer of}} the conscious hip hop movement, which focuses on social issues. [...] Subjects touched upon on Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor include absent parents, terrorism, Islam and religion, war, and prostitution. [...] Fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> his mother as [...] "very intellectual" [...] and his father as a [...] "Renaissance man". [...] He rejects the misogyny common in hip hop, which he discusses in the song [...] "Hurt Me Soul". [...] Despite this, Fiasco is strongly opposed to censorship in music: [...] "If we're going to [...] that are offensive, then {{we are going to}} have to blind and deafen everyone. Come on, man. Let's focus on education and literacy and poverty." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2016, he {{examined}} his older videos and while noting the stylistic changes he had undergone, he expressed specific regret for his casual use of words like gay or retarded in a derogatory sense. In December 2016, Kotakus Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that [...] "over the last year, the PewDiePie channel {{has also had}} an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself {{from many of the}} things that made him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like Amnesia," [...] and adding, [...] "the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand." [...] On the technical aspect of his videos, PewDiePie spoke about how his early videos would feature raw footage, although he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.|$|E
500|$|In late April, {{following}} the battles of Lexington and Concord, Allen received {{a message from}} members of an irregular Connecticut militia that they were planning to capture Fort Ticonderoga, requesting his assistance in the effort. [...] Allen, whether motivated by patriotic impulses (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> in {{his account of the}} events), or by the realization that the action might improve the political position of his side in the grants disputes, agreed to help, and began rounding up the Green Mountain Boys. On May 2, 60 men from Massachusetts and Connecticut met with Allen in Bennington, where they discussed the logistics of the expedition. By May 7, these men joined Allen and 130 Boys at Castleton. The next morning, Allen was elected to lead the expedition, and a dawn raid was planned for May 10. Two small companies were detached to procure boats, and Allen took the main contingent north to Hand's Cove in Shoreham to prepare for the crossing.|$|E

500|$|Although many of {{the lyrics}} on the album are {{intended}} to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as [...] "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. [...] His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks." [...] Eminem was inspired to write [...] "Rock Bottom" [...] after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday. [...] The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. [...] He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as [...] "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished." [...] "If I Had" [...] follows a similar theme, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> living on minimum wage and remarks that he is [...] "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour". [...] In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the [...] "white trash" [...] stereotype.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison's third studio album {{since the}} Beatles' {{break-up}} {{came at the}} end of [...] "a bad domestic year", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> it in his 1980 autobiography. From the middle of 1973, with his marriage to Pattie Boyd all but over, Harrison had immersed himself in his work, particularly on developing the acts he would eventually sign to his new record label, Dark Horse Records − Ravi Shankar and a hitherto unknown group called Splinter. Business issues related to the Beatles' company Apple Corps were also coming to a head during 1973–74, as Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr launched legal proceedings against Allen Klein, their former manager and ally against Paul McCartney (who had served the original lawsuit in December 1970 seeking to dissolve the band's partnership). The simultaneous winding down of Apple Corps' subsidiaries left a number of music and film projects in jeopardy, which resulted in Harrison having to make regular trips to Los Angeles in order to find a distributor for the Shankar Family & Friends album, most of which was recorded in California in April 1973, and Splinter's debut, The Place I Love. Another venture that was affected was the movie Little Malcolm, an Apple Films project for which Harrison was executive producer and working to seal a distribution deal in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|His {{departure}} from Hizb ut-Tahrir's world view came slowly and gradually. One of the reasons, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes,</b> was the realisation {{that he was}} abusing his faith, Islam, for a mere political project, Islamism. And once the distinction between faith and ideology was clear, he no longer felt guilty for criticising a political system inspired by medieval norms. [...] In an interview with American broadcaster National Public Radio, Nawaz explained how, other than the interactions in prison, George Orwell's novel Animal Farm {{played a major role}} in his turnaround.|$|E
2500|$|However, he {{did know}} and had evidently examined, if not read, The Justification of the Independant Churches, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the volume, {{although}} not its arguments.
