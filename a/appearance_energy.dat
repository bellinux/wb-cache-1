40|$|AbstractPhotoionization {{studies of}} (CH 3) 2 CHC(CH 3) 2 OH (tert-hexyl alcohol, also called thexyl alcohol) exhibit four fragmentations below 10 eV. As with other {{tertiary}} alcohols, no molecular ion is detected. The only ion observed at threshold corresponds to propane loss. Examination of a deuterated analogue, (CH 3) 2 CHC(CD 3) 2 OH, shows only loss of C 3 H 7 D, {{implying that the}} fragment ion has the structure of ionized acetone enol. There is no evidence for reversible deuterium transposition, as has been reported for isotopomers of the homologous secondary alcohol (CH 3) 2 CHCH(CH 3) OH. Propane loss from thexyl alcohol is attributed to intermediacy of ion–neutral complexes containing isopropyl radical and O-protonated acetone. Simple cleavage to give O-protonated acetone has an <b>appearance</b> <b>energy</b> 18 kJ mol− 1 {{higher than that of}} propane loss. Thermochemical estimates and ab initio calculations both predict that methyl loss should have a lower threshold than the fragmentation leading to isopropyl loss, but experiments show the <b>appearance</b> <b>energy</b> to be 6 kJ mol− 1 higher. This is consistent with previous reports of reverse activation barriers for methyl cleavages. Finally, formation of tert-hexyl cation, (CH 3) 2 CHC(CH 3) 2 +, is observed with an <b>appearance</b> <b>energy</b> comparable to that of methyl loss, substantially below that predicted for OH radical expulsion from the molecular ion. The comparatively low threshold of this fragmentation is ascribed to ion-pair formation (concomitant with hydroxide ion) directly from an electronically excited neutral.

The bond energy (0. 70 - 0. 3 + 0. 5) eV of (OC 1 O) [sup +, sub 2] estimated from these data {{is similar to that of}} other dimer ions, whereas the bond energy of (O[sub 3]-O[sup +, sub 3]) with (2. 55 - 0. 4 + 0. 6) eV is rather large suggesting an unusual structure for the cationic ozone dimer ion. Based on quantum chemical calculations on various levels we are led to the conclusion that the ion produced by ionization of the ozone dimer is no longer a conventional dimer ion where the two monomer units are still present (as is the case for the OC 1 O system), but rather an ion of form O[sub 2] [...] . O[sup +, sub 4] or a twisted ring structure of (O[sub 6]) [sup +]...|$|R
