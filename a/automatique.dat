25|$|The first {{semi-automatic}} rifle adopted and widely issued {{by a major}} military power (France) was the Fusil <b>Automatique</b> Modele 1917. This is a locked breech, gas-operated action which is very similar in its mechanical principles to the future M1 Garand in the United States. The M1917 was fielded during the latter stages of World War I {{but it did not}} receive a favorable reception. However its shortened and improved version, the Model 1918, was much more favourably received during the Moroccan Rif War from 1920 to 1926. The Lebel bolt-action rifle remained the standard French infantry rifle until replaced in 1936 by the MAS-36 despite the various {{semi-automatic rifle}}s designed between 1918 and 1935.|$|E

2500|$|The Lewis gun {{was invented}} by U.S. Army colonel Isaac Newton Lewis in 1911, based on initial work by Samuel Maclean. Despite its origins, the Lewis gun was not {{initially}} adopted by the US military, most likely because of political differences between Lewis and General William Crozier, {{the chief of the}} Ordnance Department. Lewis became frustrated with trying to persuade the U.S. Army to adopt his design, so ("slapped by rejections from ignorant hacks", as he said), retired from the army. He left the United States in 1913 and went to Belgium, where he established the Armes <b>Automatique</b> Lewis company in Liège to facilitate commercial production of the gun. Lewis had been working closely with British arms manufacturer the Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) in an effort to overcome some of the production difficulties of the weapon. The Belgians bought a small number of Lewises in 1913, using the [...]303 British round and, in 1914, BSA purchased a licence to manufacture the Lewis machine gun in England, which resulted in Col. Lewis receiving significant royalty payments and becoming very wealthy.|$|E

2500|$|All lines but the Yellow Line are {{equipped}} with automatic train control. Generally, the train operator does the closing of doors and starts the DA (Départ <b>automatique,</b> automatic departure), and then the train drives itself. The train operator can also drive the train manually {{at his or her}} discretion. Signalling is effected through coded pulses sent through the rails. Coded speed orders and station stop positions transmitted through track beacons are captured by beacon readers mounted under the driver cabs. The information sent to the train's electronic modules conveys speed information, and {{it is up to the}} train automatic control system computer to conform to the imposed speed. Additionally, the train computer can receive energy-saving instructions from track beacons, providing the train with four different economical coasting modes, plus one mode for maximum performance. In case of manual control, track speed is displayed on the cab speedometer indicating the maximum permissible speed. The wayside signals consist of point (switch/turnout) position indicators in proximity to switches and inter-station signalling placed at each station stop. Trains often reach their maximum speed of [...] in 16 to 26 seconds depending on grade and load.|$|E
2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil <b>Automatique</b> Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|E

50|$|For {{their third}} album, Sex, Telex enlisted the US group Sparks to help write the lyrics. However, the band still refused to play live and {{preferred}} {{to remain anonymous}} - common practice in the techno music artists the group later inspired but, nevertheless, unusual in 1981. The fourth Telex album, Wonderful World, was barely distributed. In 1986, Atlantic Records signed Telex and released the album Looney Tunes in 1988. In 1989, Telex revisited their old tracks and remixed them to resemble house music and other genres then prevalent in electronic pop. The result was Les Rythmes <b>Automatiques,</b> released in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hindrance}} to {{the full}} appreciation of Satie's parodistic music lies in its ephemerality. In his Allmusic review of the Descriptions <b>automatiques</b> Alexander Carpenter noted that [...] "although these little pieces {{stand on their own}} as charming examples of Satie the humorist, musicologists have rightly pointed out that Satie's works in this vein, like those of Ives, are self-limiting in terms of accessibility by the fact of their use of borrowed material. Street songs and children's rhymes that would have struck a chord and conveyed a multiplicity of meanings to a Parisian audience in 1913 say little to twenty-first century ears." ...|$|R
