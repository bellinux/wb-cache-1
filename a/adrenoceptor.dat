25|$|Studies {{have also}} found that {{recognition}} memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that sotalol, a β <b>adrenoceptor</b> antagonist that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered epinephrine on memory.

500|$|Altered {{dopamine}} neurotransmission is {{implicated in}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive control, in turn leading to problems with regulating attention (attentional control), inhibiting behaviors (inhibitory control), and forgetting things or missing details (working memory), among other problems. [...] There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically dopamine receptor D1 and <b>adrenoceptor</b> A2, in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, a {{systematic}} review and a meta-analysis {{of high quality}} clinical trials found that therapeutic doses of amphetamine and methylphenidate result in modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, episodic memory, and inhibitory control, in normal healthy adults; the cognition-enhancing effects of these drugs are known to occur through the indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and <b>adrenoceptor</b> α2 in the prefrontal cortex.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate why cooling augments the contractile responses of superficial veins, but depresses that of deep limb veins. Rings of dog's saphenous veins were mounted in an organ chamber for isometric tension recording. Cooling (from 37 to 24 °C) depressed the tissular uptake of [3 H]norepinephrine and potentiated the contraction caused by norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation; this potentiation persisted after inhibition of the disposition mechanisms for the catecholamine and {{in the presence of}} ouabain or iproveratril. The affinity of the alpha <b>adrenoceptors,</b> to judge from the K(A) values for norepinephrine and from the pA 2 values for the competitive antagonist phentolamine, was significantly greater at 24 °C than at 37 °C. Thus, an instantaneous change in the affinity of alpha <b>adrenoceptors</b> explains the augmented response of the cutaneous veins to adrenergic stimulation. By contrast, cooling depressed the response of femoral veins to norepinephrine and did not significantly affect the affinity of alpha <b>adrenoceptors</b> in this preparation, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of alpha <b>adrenoceptors</b> in cutaneous veins is related to chronic exposure to variations in local temperature. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the factors concerned with the response of canine and human saphenous veins to adrenergic stimulation. Both vessels have prejunctional muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptors. When activated by appropriate agonists these receptors decrease and increase the output, respectively, of norepinephrine from the nerve endings. Both vessels have postjunctional α 1 and α 2 <b>adrenoceptors</b> and postjunctional β <b>adrenoceptors.</b> Activation of the former two receptors leads to contraction of the smooth muscle, and of the latter to relaxation. There are, however, qualitative differences. In the human veins the responsiveness of the prejunctional β <b>adrenoceptors</b> exceeds that of the postjunctional, whereas the reverse is true in the dog. As a consequence, in the human vein β-adrenergic agonists augment, and in the canine veins they depress, the contractile response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{norepinephrine}} {{levels in}} the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increase delay-related firing and enhance working memory, whereas stress-related or pathologically high levels of norepinephrine are believed to inhibit working memory via a 1 <b>adrenoceptors.</b> However, {{it has been shown}} that activation of Gq-coupled and phospholipase C-linked receptors can induce persistent firing, a cellular correlate of working memory, in cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, despite its importance in stress and cognition, the exact role of norepinephrine in modulating PFC activity remains elusive. Using electrophysiology and optogenetics, we report here that norepinephrine induces persistent firing in pyramidal neurons of the PFC independent of recurrent fast synaptic excitation. This persistent excitatory effect involves presynaptic a 1 <b>adrenoceptors</b> facilitating glutamate release and subsequent activation of postsynaptic mGluR 5 receptors, and is enhanced by postsynaptic a 2 <b>adrenoceptors</b> inhibiting HCN channel activity. Activation of a 2 <b>adrenoceptors</b> or inhibition of HCN channels also enhances cholinergic persistent responses in pyramidal neurons, providing a mechanism of crosstalk between noradrenergic and cholinergic inputs.

40|$|Most alpha 2 -adrenoceptor {{agonists}} developed so far will penetrate {{into the}} brain, thus causing central hypotensive activity, {{mediated by the}} stimulation of alpha 2 <b>adrenoceptors</b> {{in the region of}} the nucleus tractus solitarii, the vasomotor center and the nucleus of the vagus nerve. The central alpha 2 <b>adrenoceptors</b> are probably located at postjunctional (postsynaptic) sites. Their stimulation causes sympathoinhibition and thus a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. The central hypotensive effect is the dominating activity of all alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists developed so far, of which clonidine, guanfacine and alpha-methyl-DOPA (which is converted into alpha-methyl-noradrenaline) are the prototypes. Peripheral postsynaptic effects probably do not greatly contribute to the hypotensive activity of these drugs. Sedation, also mediated by central alpha 2 <b>adrenoceptors</b> is the major adverse reaction to these antihypertensive agents. More selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists (B-HT 920, azepexole, UK 14, 304) appear to display the same pattern of hypotensive and sedative activities as the nonselective compounds like clonidine. After the general survey on centrally acting alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonistic drugs, the pharmacologic profile of the new oxazoline derivative, rilmenidine, (S 3341) was compared with that of the classic compound, clonidine. In all current animal and in vitro models, rilmenidine was characterized as a clonidine-like, centrally acting antihypertensive drug. Thus, its central hypotensive activity proved mediated by the stimulation of central alpha 2 <b>adrenoceptors.</b> In radioligand binding studies, rilmenidine proved somewhat more selective for alpha 2 <b>adrenoceptors,</b> but this selectivity was not reflected by a clearly different pharmacologic profile of the drug.
