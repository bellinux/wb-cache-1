40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for studying the process of accounting changes based on a cultural perspective. An accounting change triggered by an intrusion of external events {{is influenced by the}} continuous interactions among the institutional consequences and societal as well as accounting values. The process of an accounting change can be decomposed into the phase of system change (form) and the phase of subsequent practice change (substance). The system changes are direct and immediate products of institutional consequencies as long as the regulatory authority ackowledges the legitimacy of the change. Practice changes are products not only of system change (regulation) but of cultural changes which is constrained by pervasive <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> (general acceptance). The discrepancy between the underlying paradigms of the regulation and the existing convention functions as a mediating variable. The influences of an intrusive event on the societal as well as accounting values is not as obvious as those on accounting systems because it tends to take longer time for the values to fully accommodate changes. Changes in accounting system may induce accounting values to change. Provided that the goal of the system change is consistent with existing value systems, the change in <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> can be prompt.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} database {{on domestic}} support is key for any meaningful agri-food policy {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) analysis. In the GTAP database – the main data source used for global CGE analysis – domestic support levels are calculated from the OECD Producer Support Estimate (PSE).

40|$|Overnight Federal {{funds and}} {{overnight}} Eurodollars {{are among the}} most liquid short-term assets that a bank can hold to acquire required reserves. They are traded overnight and denominated in U. S. dollars. They also have different characteristics: The Fed funds market and the Eurodollar market are located in different places, and the transaction volume is larger in the overnight Eurodollar market than in the Fed funds market. This paper is an empirical work on the relationship between the Federal funds rate and the overnight Eurodollar rate. Hamilton (1996) found that the Fed funds rate exhibited calendar day effects over 1984 - 1990. I find that the overnight Eurodollar rate exhibits very similar calendar day effects but the absolute magnitudes are slightly less in general over 1984 - 1997. The empirical results support the hypothesis that the tendency in daily changes in the Federal funds rate and in the overnight Eurodollar rate are caused by line limits, transaction costs and <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> in the Federal funds market. The differential between the Fed funds rate and the overnight Eurodollar rate is predictable and it possibly provides the evidence against the efficient market hypothesis.

Before 2008, pension plans were not {{directly}} included in the financial statements, but could only be found in Page 1 of 29 Parkhomovsky the footnote disclosures. Such <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> essentially made pensions a type of offbalance sheet financing resulting in a misrepresentation of valuation ratios and earnings due to the exclusion of such a significant liability. The objective of this research is to determine whether the funded status of a pension plan will significantly affect a company’s shareholder equity. As part of this research, I analyzed 4 years (2001 - 2004) of financial statements for a sample of 30 companies, focusing on earnings per share, book value per share, and percentage by which the pension plan is overfunded or underfunded. Using regression analysis, I determine whether the funded status of a pension plan will affect the company’s stock price. The results indicated a statistically significant correlation between level of pension plan funding and shareholder equity, with an R 2 of 0. 65 and 0. 59 in years 2001 and 2004 respectively.

40|$|The use of {{conventional}} historic cost accounting {{during periods of}} inflation leads to the overstatement of profit; this in turn may result in overdistribution of resources which should {{have been used to}} preserve the income-earning base of the firm. Should such overdistributions occur, they will add to the circulation of money without a corresponding increase of output and hence increase inflation. During deflation the opposite effects may occur. Thus <b>accounting</b> <b>conventions</b> could amplify inflation or deflation and lead to economic instability. The distortions which thus may be imposed on the economy's income earning capacity and the increased risks arising from the consequent economic instability are likely to lead to corporate failures. Should it be found that <b>accounting</b> <b>conventions</b> operate in this way then, for reasons which are outlined, efforts should be made during a period of relatively low inflation to change the <b>accounting</b> <b>conventions.</b> Other implications of the hypothesis are also discussed.

40|$|First-best optimal {{forest sector}} carbon policy is examined. Using a {{comprehensive}} forest sector {{model with a}} detailed carbon cycle section we show that the renewability and carbon neutrality arguments do not warrant emission free treatment of forest bioenergy. However, under the biomass stock change carbon <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> followed by UNFCCC and IPCC, the forest owners pay for the roundwood emissions and, to avoid double counting, the use of roundwood is treated as emission free. The bioenergy from harvest residues cannot be treated as emission free either. Their emission factors are determined through the decay time-scales specific to residue fractions and discount rate used in welfare assessment. In addition, we show that an optimal policy subsidizes the production of wood products sequestering carbon. The relative magnitude of the subsidy {{is based on the}} fraction of the carbon stored, the lifetime of the products and the discount rate. Correspondingly, the carbon removals by biomass growth are subsidized and the harvest residue generation taxed. Further, we show that the supply side policies are independent of final use of harvested timber. Numerical solution of the model shows that, although the use of wood is not emission free, it is optimal to increase the use of wood, possibly also in the energy sector. Before the wood use can be increased, the forest biomass has to be increased. This initial carbon sink speeds up the convergence to the lower steady-state atmospheric carbon stock...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{biofuels}} such as ethanol and biodiesel {{are considered}} important renewable replacements for petroleum fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Biomass-based energy carriers are traditionally treated as inherently carbon neutral, {{so that only}} the fossil-based carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other non-CO 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their production are counted when assessing their global warming impact. This <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> is embedded by construction in lifecycle assessment (LCA) models, which on a direct basis (i. e., excluding economically induced effects) often find that biofuels from efficient industrial agricultural production systems reduce GHG emissions relative to their fossil fuel counterparts. LCA modeling can be subjected to an independent empirical test that bounds a biofuel's potential GHG reduction within {{the dynamics of the}} terrestrial carbon cycle. Such a test can be performed using annual basis carbon (ABC) accounting, which entails spatially and temporally explicit analysis of the direct GHG exchanges between the atmosphere and a physical vehicle-fuel system. An ABC case study of a corn ethanol biorefinery and the farmland that supplies it shows that using the ethanol it produced instead of gasoline provided no significant reduction in GHG emissions, in contrast to an LCA result that found a 40 % GHG reduction for the same facility. ABC accounting reveals that the renewable ethanol so produced was not carbon neutral when substituting for gasoline, and sensitivity analysis indicates that its net GHG emissions impacts are likely to higher than those of petroleum gasoline in practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{engagement}} of JRC IPTS in the GTAP contributing {{team to the}} EU domestic support has opened up the opportunity to use the CATS database when compiling EU domestic support payments by member state, which are subsequently calibrated into the GTAP database. To maintain consistency, the GTAP version 9 includes EU domestic support which follows the approach adopted in the previous releases (Jensen, 2009, 2010). The difference is for pillar 1 support for which the CATS data are used (in previous GTAP database releases, pillar 1 support was based on EAGF financial reports). All together EU domestic support amounts to 66, 530 million euros in 2011 (i. e. pillar 1 expenditures from CATS, pillar 2 and national expenditures from Producer Support Estimate (PSE) by OECD). In addition, minor improvements to the allocation of payments have been proposed for the version 9 release. On the other hand previous research at JRC IPTS (Boulanger and Philippidis, 2014, 2015) showed that when comparing with the CATS database, the GTAP database was incomplete, particularly in its representation of CAP rural development payments, or so called pillar 2 payments. This paper compares the EU domestic support approach adopted in the GTAP database version 9 with an alternative one {{in order to make}} the representation of CAP expenditures more transparent and comprehensive. Such an alternative allocation includes more payments than the traditional method employed (e. g. the proposed classification includes support currently defined as General Services Support Estimate (GSSE) by the OECD).

The concept of risk has two elements, the likelihood of something happening and the consequence if it happens. ’ 1 As with any other aspect of public sector administration, risk management has to be considered {{in the context of the}} changing culture and framework of the public service. In a keynote address to the Public Sector <b>Accounting</b> <b>Convention</b> earlier this month, the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) noted that the new Government has some significantly different approaches to the role of the public sector and the way in which public services are delivered. He went on to say that the Government is looking for innovative and well considered strategies to improve APS operations and service delivery.

Rather our focus will be on investigating the risk management plans that were in place and considering what lessons can be learned and how the same mistakes can be avoided in the future. ’ 3 This is very encouraging.

40|$|The {{failure of}} the Reserve Primary Fund, a US money market fund, in September 2008 {{triggered}} a widespread withdrawal of assets from other money market funds in the US. The withdrawals led the US Government to adopt emergency measures to maintain market stability. The ability of money market funds to rapidly withdraw funding from the financial system also showed during the European sovereign debt crisis {{in the summer of}} 2011. The crisis prompted further regulatory debate {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic on how to make money market funds more resilient to investors’ runs and systemic shocks. The solutions that are currently discussed propose to eliminate the essential bank-like feature of money market funds – their ability to transact at a stable share price – and thereby reduce their attractiveness to investors seeking cash management options outside the banking system. This thesis detaches from those discussions originally enquiring on how should money market funds be regulated in the US and in the EU. As a theoretical premise, this research identifies two overarching goals for money market funds regulation, namely, investor protection and systemic stability. The prevalent proposals for regulation are thus seen as misguided because the change in money market funds pricing mechanisms and the <b>accounting</b> <b>convention</b> would demonstrably not satisfy these goals. In order to formulate the new propositions for the regulation of money market funds in the US and the EU, therefore, this thesis first critically evaluates the existing US and EU regulatory frameworks applicable to money market funds from the standpoint of the dual policy goal of investor protection and systemic stability. Secondly, it introduces an alternative path for achieving this dual goal. It is argued that the blueprint of the international money market fund regulation ought to focus on full disclosure of the funds’ assets and liabilities – portfolio holdings and fund investors – as the primary measure of investor protection. Such disclosure also addresses systemic stability concerns by empowering regulators to properly monitor the transmission channels of funding risk. While my study does not purport to do away with risk limiting rules for money market funds, it cautions against copying the US-centric view of the investment standards to the much shallower European markets under the banners of harmonisation. Instead, this thesis advocates a harmonised international approach to the transparency of money market fund activities and the creation of a global database of market 5 exposures that would subject asset managers to public scrutiny and enable regulators to monitor the major risk transmitting channels. By these means the dual regulatory goal in money market fund regulation – investor protection and systemic stability – shall be upheld...|$|E

In 2002 and 2003 the results were less conclusive exhibiting a lower R 2 of ~ 0. 44 and not providing enough evidence to conclusively reject the null hypothesis. The latter findings may be attributed to an inadequate sample size or other significant external factors such as interest rates and economic conditions, which may have a critical affect on my findings. Pension plan underfunding, plan freezing, and the recent implementation of FAS 158 result in significant accounting issues for today’s companies. The most notable example with wide media coverage was the General Motors debacle, which resulted from a massive pension liability. This liability would become the responsibility of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC), an entity that protects the pensions of 44 million American workers and is funded by the premiums from the participating companies in case the company goes into bankruptcy. This could set precedence for companies with massively underfunded pension plans which don’t want to pay pension obligations to their employees. Another important issue affecting companies and their pension plans is pension plan freezing. In order to reduce costs and stay competitive, more firms are freezing their defined benefit pensions. The last issue considered is the recent implementation of FAS 158, which requires companies to put their pensions on the financial statements preventing off balance sheet reporting and leading to increased transparency. Given current financial and actuarial challenges in valuing their plans, I would suggest that companies use realistic discount rates, expected rates of return and longevity models. Additionally, it is essential that the duration of plan investments is appropriately matched to expected liabilities. Such practices will lead an increase in accuracy of pension plan valuations. Since companies are now obligated to record their pensions on the financial statements, they will be increasingly focusing on decreasing their liabilities as well as the volatility of their financials in order to enhance shareholder value...|$|E
