5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form <b>a</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> 1:2, <b>a</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} for increasing the size and number of their capital ships.

American isolationist feeling and the economic concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval Treaty (also known as the Five-Power treaty), and limitations on the use of submarines. The Treaty prescribed <b>a</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> 5:5:3:1:1 for capital ships between treaty nations.

Many older ships were scrapped by the five nations to meet the treaty limitations, and new building of capital ships limited.|$|E
