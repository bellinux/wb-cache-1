40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{atmospheric}} refraction, affected by temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, on <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar beam paths. Using three types of typical atmospheric background sounding data, we established a simulation model for an actual transmission path and a fitted correction path of an <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar beam during airplane take-offs and landings based on initial flight parameters and X-band <b>airborne</b> phased-array <b>weather</b> radar parameters. Errors in an ideal electromagnetic beam propagation path are much greater than those of a fitted path when atmospheric refraction is not considered. The rates {{of change in the}} atmospheric refraction index differ with weather conditions and the radar detection angles differ during airplane take-off and landing. Therefore, the airborne radar detection path must be revised in real time according to the specific sounding data and flight parameters. However, an error analysis indicates that a direct linear-fitting method produces significant errors in a negatively refractive atmosphere; a piecewise-fitting method can be adopted to revise the paths according to the actual atmospheric structure. This study provides researchers and practitioners in the aeronautics and astronautics field with updated information regarding {{the effect of}} atmospheric refraction on <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar <b>detection</b> and correction methods...|$|R

Currently, the theoretical research of <b>airborne</b> dual-polarization <b>weather</b> radar is in the development stage. To provide high-fidelity simulation data required for <b>airborne</b> dual-polarization <b>weather</b> radar <b>detection</b> technology, in this study, a simulation method of the polarization characteristics of rainfall determined using <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar based on numerical weather prediction is proposed.

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as wireless local area networks and cellular telephones have dramatically increased the use of wireless communications services within the last 10 years. The shortage of available spectrum exists due to increasing demand for wireless services and current spectrum allocation regulations. To alleviate this shortage, Research aims to improve spectral efficiency and to allow spectrum sharing between separately managed and non-coordinating communications systems. This thesis explores the feasibility of spectrum sharing between <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar and wireless local area networks at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz. Characteristics of flight paths of aircraft using <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar and the low duty cycle of radar transmissions offer unique opportunities for spectrum sharing. But {{it was found that}} the extremely sensitive receivers provide challenges for designing a communications system meant for widespread use. The probability of causing harmful interference to <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar is too great for most types of wireless local area networks, but a direct sequence spread spectrum scheme could share spectrum with <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar. Bit errors in wireless local area network links caused by <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar interference do not significantly decrease the performance of the wireless local area network system. The distribution of interference outside of the <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar receiver by using direct sequence spread spectrum combined with the acceptable bit error rates indicate that while spectrum sharing between <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar and wireless local area network at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz is not feasible, direct sequence spread spectrum systems can share spectrum with <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radars under more limited assumptions...|$|R

For the <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> radar signal processing, {{the intensity of}} the meteorological targets is represented by the physical quantity called reflectivity factor. When observing the middle-or long-range meteorological targets at low altitude from a high-altitude radar platform, due to the incomplete beam filling, the retrieval result of the reflectivity factor is much less than the actual value.

The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed wind vector measurement algorithms are supported by computer simulations indicating their potential as a powerful tool for the wind field reconstruction.

40|$|Extreme weather {{conditions}} seem to occur {{stronger and more}} frequently due to climate change. Very expensive technology is used to predict them, which results problematic {{when they have to}} be used in less developed countries. An alternative could be to employ digital sensors, such as phone cameras or existing webcam infrastructures, widely distributed in many countries in the world, and to analyse the captured images. Many methods have been proposed for <b>weather</b> <b>detection</b> including also Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The latter have recently become very popular in the field of computer vision due to their excellent performance in image recognition tasks. However, CNNs are characterized by a high number of learnable parameters that need an equally high number of data points to achieve good performance. Since very big dataset are hardly available, techniques that help to overcome this problem, such as transfer learning, can be used. Different are the transfer learning approaches: the fine-tuning approach, i. e. re-training all the network layers, and the freezing layers approach, i. e. re-training just a subset of the network layers. In collaboration with IBM Netherlands Center for Advance Studies, we optimized a ResNet- 18 architecture, modifying the architecture depth and applying regularization methods, to perform <b>weather</b> <b>detection</b> of images showing rain or no-rain conditions.

Improved solar cells and more efficient and lighter aircraft structures enable permanent stationing of solar powered drones, providing a variety of remote sensing capabilities. For this purpose, a combination of an efficient energy system and aircraft configuration is decisive. This is particularly true for the stationing of "High Altitude Pseudo Satellites (HAPS) " in the stratosphere.
