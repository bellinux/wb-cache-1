5|$|Zinc {{burns in}} <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room {{temperature}} with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|DEA agents collect MI6 agent James Bond and {{his friend}} (and CIA agent) Felix Leiter, {{on their way to}} Leiter's wedding in Key West, to have them assist in {{capturing}} drugs lord Franz Sanchez.

Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Vildanden {{was founded}} on 23 November 2004 by 18 local investors who wanted to start {{commercial}} scheduled flights from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. For a long period, {{there had been a}} public debate about closing the airport. Owned by the municipality, the airport was receiving annual subsidies of NOK2.5 million from the municipality, and NOK3.8 million from the state. It was decided to operate Vildanden as a virtual airline (one that owns none of its equipment, leasing everything from others), and wet lease operations from other companies. Initial plans had been started in 2003 to cooperate with Dutch airline Denim <b>Air,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 50-seater aircraft, but these plans did not work out.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in <b>air.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E

25|$|In July 2017, as {{temperatures}} in the city rose, straphangers expressed complaints about the high temperatures of stations along the line, {{even though they were}} supposed to be climate-controlled.

25|$|The current {{recommendations}} for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The ATSDR Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1µg/m3 and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2µg/m3 According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is {{an estimate of}} the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> concentration of 0.2µg mercury/m3 would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m3/day).
