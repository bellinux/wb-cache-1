40|$|AbstractDifferences between {{measured}} and predicted energy demand of dwellings across construction age-bands {{are of interest}} since these categories mark changes in construction methods and building codes over time. This study compared empirical measures of <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> for three-bedroom dwellings in the UK with predictions from the Cambridge Housing Model (CHM), a bottom-up building physics model used for national energy statistics and government policy development. It used <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> data collected from 2008 to 2010 from a sample of 255 three-bedroom dwellings. For age-bands of dwellings built since 1919, empirical estimates of <b>annual</b> <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> in 2011 were slightly higher than the model predictions but the rate of decline across age bands matched the model closely. For dwellings built before 1919, which are characterised by solid wall construction, the empirical estimates were markedly lower than the model predictions both for <b>annual</b> <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> and the Power Temperature Gradient (W/K) – a first order estimate of energy performance from monthly data.

This practice of burn-ing gas or releasing it into the atmosphere not only harms the environment, including by adding significantly to greenhouse gas emis-sions. It also deprives developing country con-sumers of an energy source that is cleaner and often cheaper than others available and reduces potential tax revenue and trade balances.

40|$|This paper uses a socio-technical {{building}} {{performance evaluation}} (BPE) approach {{to assess the}} pre- and post- actual performance of two discrete deep low energy retrofits in the UK – a Victorian solid-wall house and modern 1990 s cavity-wall house. A ‘low-energy first, then low-carbon’ approach was adopted in both cases, to achieve an 80 % reduction in annual CO 2 emissions. Pre-retrofit, both houses had lower measured <b>annual</b> <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> as compared to predictions made by energy models, although the electricity consumption in the modern house was higher than modelled, due to occupancy pattern and occupant behaviour. Post-retrofit, {{it was found that}} the Victorian house achieved nearly 75 % CO 2 reduction, while the modern house achieved only 57 % CO 2 reduction over the baseline emissions. Key reasons were higher than expected air permeability rates, installation issues with micro-renewable systems, lack of proper commissioning, usability of controls, occupant preferences and behaviour. Despite the gap between expected and actual carbon emissions, occupant comfort and satisfaction was significantly improved across both retrofits. This evidence-based understanding of the process and outcomes of deep low carbon retrofits is vital not only for learning and innovation, but also for scaling-up deep retrofit programmes for meeting national and international carbon targets...|$|R

The recently released National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED) database is used to examine the changes in domestic gas and total energy consumptions for the dwellings in the sample relative to the changes in gas and total energy consumptions for a comparable control group in the year after installation. The results obtained from this difference-in-difference analysis confirm that observed energy consumption decreases significantly in dwellings following upgrades such as cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and a new efficient boiler. The single most effective energy efficiency measure when installed alone is found to be cavity wall insulation, reducing <b>annual</b> <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> by 10. 5 % and annual total energy consumption by 8. 0 % in the year following installation. Comparing bundles of different energy efficiency measures, we find that dwellings retrofitted with both cavity wall insulation and a new efficient boiler experience the largest reductions in <b>annual</b> <b>gas</b> and total energy consumptions of 13. 3 and 13. 5 %, respectively. This is followed by a mean annual reduction of 11. 9 and 10. 5 % in gas and total energy consumptions for dwellings with all three energy efficiency measures installed in the same year.

With 133 tcf gas reserves {{it is a major}} gas resource owner, the largest in Asia and ninth largest in the world. Australia, however, is a large country and its gas reserves tend to be located in remote locations and this, together with the small population of the country and its modest <b>annual</b> <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> (in 2011 26 bcma compared to 105 bcma in Japan and 80 bcma in the United Kingdom) means that, in order to commercialise its gas, capital-intensive LNG export schemes have had to be developed. Australian companies, supported by the Australian government, have been following this strategy since the successful start-up of the North West Shelf project in 1989, but only since 2010 has the industry seen a serious increase in the growth of LNG export projects sanctioned. In 2011 Australia exported 26 bcma LNG, through two LNG projects (the same amount of gas as it consumed domestically). LNG exports in 2011 were valued by the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics at A$ 11 bn, approximately 6 percent of Australia’s energy and resources export earnings. It is the planned future growth of Australia’s LNG exports that will change the face of LNG globally with the country expected to overtake Qatar as the largest supplier of LNG before 2020. In addition, the country is the first to spearhead LNG production from coal bed methane (also known as coal seam gas), which can be produced in commercial quantities when the coal is de-pressurised and de-watered through drilling and the application of suitable well technology. This is a development that was not thought feasible ten years ago. Developers expected the location of the coal seam gas LNG plants on the East Coast – nearer to the main population centres and with an onshore gas supply – to lead to lower cost LNG export plants when compared to those located on the more remote, and environmentally sensitive, north-west of the country which are based on offshore gas reserves. The extent to which the East Coast LNG projects will be cheaper than the conventional gas projects of the northwest is still to be proven. This rapid growth of LNG export investment is causing substantial challenges to project developers as projects compete for resources, human and financial. This article will examine the LNG projects that are under development and look forward to see how the Australian LNG sector can expand further in the future. It will also discuss Australia’s competitiveness for future LNG supplies in the next decade. </p...|$|R

The projects described in this thesis aim to contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation through structural studies of nitrogenase. Nitrogenase consists of the iron and molybdenum-iron (MoFe) proteins, the latter of which contains the active site, the FeMo-cofactor. Throughout my work, I compare the MoFe proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii (Av 1) and Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp 1), the two most structurally divergent molybdenum nitrogenases known. Determining the similarities and differences between these proteins may aid our understanding of biological nitrogen fixation.

Gas consumption in China is predicted to reach around 178649. 23 million cubic meters by the end of 2015 and about 264698. 86 million cubic meters by 2020...|$|R
40|$|This short {{communication}} examines {{whether or}} not U. S. natural <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> follows a stationary process. Unlike previous research that has focused on regional country or industrial sector-based panel studies, this study undertakes a sub-national investigation of natural <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> for the 50 U. S. states. Levin et al. (2002), Im et al. (2003), Maddala and Wu (1999), and Hadri (2000) panel unit root and stationarity tests reveal that natural <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> is integrated of order one. However, once allowance is made for endogenously determined structural breaks, the Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005), Im et al. (2005), and Westerlund (2005) panel unit root and stationarity tests indicate that natural <b>gas</b> <b>consumption</b> is integrated of order zero. Discussion of the structural breaks is briefly surveyed {{in relation to the}} natural gas industry's response to legislative actions.
