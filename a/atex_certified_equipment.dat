Phenolic compounds, released by the roots, can be eliminated with oxidising methods. However efficacy has not been investigated.

40|$|Autonomous Flight Rules (AFR) are {{proposed}} {{as a new}} set of operating regulations in which aircraft navigate on tracks of their choice while self-separating from traffic and weather. AFR would exist alongside Instrument and Visual Flight Rules (IFR and VFR) as one of three available flight options for any appropriately trained and qualified operator with the necessary <b>certified</b> <b>equipment.</b> Historically, ground-based separation services evolved by necessity as aircraft began operating in the clouds and were unable to see each other. Today, technologies for global navigation, airborne surveillance, and onboard computing enable the functions of traffic conflict management to be fully integrated with navigation procedures onboard the aircraft. By self-separating, aircraft can operate with more flexibility and fewer restrictions than are required when using ground-based separation. The AFR concept is described in detail and provides practical means by which self-separating aircraft could share the same airspace as IFR and VFR aircraft without disrupting the ongoing processes of Air Traffic Control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Equipment {{for use in}} {{potentially}} {{explosive atmosphere}} is subject to particular requirements on safety and quality as determined {{by a number of}} Standards. For use in Europe, such equipment needs to conform to the EC directive 94 / 9 /EC, also called “ATEX Directive”. The conformity must be certified by a socalled ATEX Certificate. In the frame of the EC-funded research project „Corrosion testing of tank ships“, AE-field tests on board large tank ships were executed. Intrinsically safe certified AE sensors were temporarily immersed through a potentially explosive atmosphere from the tank top through manholes into the liquid contents. Ship owners and involved classification societies insisted on the availability of a system certificate confirming intrinsic safety for the used sensors and isolation barriers. This paper summarizes basics of explosion protection and the ATEX directive, the safety requirements on Acoustic Emission field test equipment for use in potentially explosive atmosphere, and shows a realization of <b>certified</b> <b>equipment</b> and data acquired from immersed sensors on board of a tank ship and used for the location of a natural artificial AE corrosion source...|$|R

A parent kernel key point of this “policy package” is quality: certification of thermal solar system and components; planner, designer and installer certification; technical mandatory requirements in the regulations; mandatory guarantee (maintenance contract). All relevant documents of these quality items must be integrated in the Building Use Manual for easy management. Another kernel key point, this one with focus on overcoming barriers, is public awareness, throughout on-line information (lists of <b>certified</b> <b>equipments,</b> installers, technical description of the equipments, manual of good practices, scholar materials (class notes, computer codes, homework assignments, etc.), etc.), and the implementation of training courses for al...|$|R
