5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim <b>authority</b> <b>as</b> the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E

5|$|At its height, the Mongolian empire {{stretched}} from Shanhaiguan {{in the east}} to Budapest in the west, from Rus' in the north to Tibet in the south.

In fact, there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach were indeed at odds {{at some point in the}} 1150s or 1160s, as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach's <b>authority</b> <b>as</b> overlord.|$|E
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish <b>authority,</b> <b>as</b> well as convey information.

Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E

While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
