5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with {{his knowledge of}} the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
500|$|Handel's {{reputation}} in England, {{where he had}} lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, {{it is not in}} dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> annunciation to the shepherds, the only [...] "scene" [...] taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion and ends with the [...] "Hallelujah" [...] chorus. In Part III he covers the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven.|$|E

500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] is a dance-pop and synthpop {{song with}} electro rock and house influences. The song starts out with {{electronic}} church bells and Gaga softly singing [...] "I'm gonna marry the night/I won't {{give up on}} my life/I'm a warrior queen/Live passionately tonight." [...] Soon the beat changes into a dance one, accompanied with techno beats, handclaps and funk music, <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chorus, where Gaga stutters the line [...] "Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry the night". It was compared by Tim Jonze from The Guardian to the Eurodance song, [...] "It's My Life" [...] by Dr Alban, while Nicola James from MTV compared the chorus with Jennifer Lopez's 1999 single [...] "Waiting for Tonight. In a pre-release review of certain album tracks, Peter Robinson from the NME blog wrote that Gaga channels [...] "Whitney Houston-esque pop euphoria" [...] into the song, notably that from the singer's musical peak.|$|E

500|$|Each battle {{begins with}} the wrestlers' {{entrance}} sequence. Two types of controls can be chosen to fight. The default one uses the DualShock 2's analog sticks exclusively; the left one being pressed for movements and the right one for attacks. Pins are executed by tilting both sticks up; and pressing both sticks grabs the opponent, who can then be attacked or thrown depending {{on the way the}} right stick is tilted. The second type of controls, called [...] "Type B", is closer to other fighting games and assigns pinning to the triangle button, grabbing to the square button, and punches <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cross button. With Type B, the power of each move is determined by the level of pressure applied on the buttons. In both modes, the precise techniques available depend on the position and distance of the opponent, as well as a personal [...] "tension meter" [...] which builds up during battle. At any time, the D-pad can be used to change the angle of the camera.|$|E

500|$|Flowering occurs between October and December in {{its native}} range, with plants at higher {{elevations}} flowering later than ones at lower altitude. [...] The crimson flowerheads, known as inflorescences, are about [...] in diameter. They {{are composed of}} 36 to 60 individual flowers with green to pink bracts, which may be up to [...] long. Each flower is encased in a [...] long perianth, which is a much brighter red on the surface facing {{the centre of the}} flower than the surface facing outwards. Anthesis, or the opening of the flowers, begins with those at the centre of the flowerhead <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edges or base. The individual flower bears a sessile anther (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style.

Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E

It is also featured on the DualDisc edition of the album #1's {{as well as on}} the Japanese version of the DVD [...] In 2013, it was included on the album Destiny's Child Video Anthology which contained every music video the group had filmed during their career.

The video opens with a fast instance of a sun rising in the sky <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girls standing nude together. Each singer is featured in her own desert scene performing individually during her respective verse; Beyoncé is seen on a diving board next to a swimming pool, Rowland on a deserted road where she dances next to a silver car from which she had previously got out of and Williams on a sunlounger. During the chorus the group members are seen wearing fishtail evening dresses, performing a choreographed dance routine for the camera and three males who watch them from the side; the men are never filmed in the same shot as Destiny's Child. During the end, each member is seen together with one of their male partners and the video fades away showing the trio nude again as during the beginning.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Carey's debut album, which {{featured}} a more contemporary pop and R background, Emotions {{proved to be}} far different. It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, R, soul, pop and 1960s and 1970s influences. The album's lead single [...] "Emotions" [...] borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register. The song's lyrics were described as [...] "joyful" [...] by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover. One of the album's more gospel infused songs, [...] "And You Don't Remember," [...] featured organ chord changes and held minimal production {{in order to give}} the vocals a more [...] "raw and sixties feel." [...] It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to Motown ballads, with the inclusion of soft church choir vocals, and sole musical arrangement by Carey. Its lyrics reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next one. After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him [...] "Don't You Remember" [...] all those things he had promised her, and the things they had spoken and dreamed about doing together. [...] "Can't Let Go," [...] the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content. The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from fifties balladry. For the duration {{of the first half of}} the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the belted crescendo and falsetto and whistle finish. Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on [...] "Make It Happen," [...] which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia. It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "very Motownish," [...] as well as noting its soft gospel infusion. Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres. According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{period of}} the books begins in the 1920s <b>and</b> <b>moves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1970s as the 50 books {{progress}} (the character being seemingly ageless). In early books most activities are illegal, although directed at villains. In later books, this becomes less so. In books written during World War II, The Saint was recruited {{by the government to}} help track spies and similar undercover work. Later he became a cold warrior fighting Communism. The quality of writing also changes; early books have a freshness which becomes replaced by cynicism in later works. A few Saint stories crossed into science fiction and fantasy, [...] "The Man Who Liked Ants" [...] and the early novel The Last Hero being examples; one Saint short story, [...] "The Darker Drink", was even published in the October 1952 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. When early Saint books were republished in the 1960s to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to see freshly written introductions by Charteris apologizing for the out-of-date tone; according to a Charteris [...] "apology" [...] in a 1969 paperback of Featuring the Saint, he attempted to update some earlier stories when they were reprinted but gave up and let them sit as period pieces. The 1963 edition of the short story collection The Happy Highwayman contains examples of abandoned revisions; in one story published in the 1930s ("The Star Producers"), references to actors of the 1930s were replaced for 1963 with names of current movie stars; another 1930s-era story, [...] "The Man Who Was Lucky", added references to atomic power.|$|E
