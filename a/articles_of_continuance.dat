40|$|This {{report is}} the result of Jamie Unwin's Master's in Environmental Studies (Planning) Major Project. It was {{conducted}} over a twelve-month period and designed to explore the validity and capacity for the Canadian Institute of Planning (CIP) to facilitate a national Planning for Food Systems Platform to help spur the shift of the food system 1 toward sustainability and health, required for food secure 2 Canadian communities. This shift is necessary because the current dominant food system is incapable of fostering healthy sustianable food systems 3 as it undermines the very environmental, social and economic resources that our food systems depend upon (Mendes, 2008; Potukuchi &Kaufman, 2000; Wittman, Desmarais & Wiebe, 2011; Le Vallee, 2008). The results of this research clearly highlight the validity and capacity of CIP to facilitate a national planning for food systems platform that engages with the complexity of food systems from an interdisciplinary collaborative approach involving knowledge sharing, networking, and professional development. Due to this, this report has been designed to explain and provide background information for further consultation on: the validity and capacity of CIP to facilitate this platform and to adopt 'Food Systems' as a "topic" on their website. This platform focuses on planning for food systems 4 through the lens of the profession of planning, whereas food system planning is about the design and management of the entire food system itself. The term platform 5 was used because it provided for exploration of alternative ways to engage with planning for food systems within and outside of the existing subcommittee structure of CIP's National Initiatives Advisory Committee. A food systems framework has been used as the professional discourse (OPPI, 2011; Wegener, Seasons & Raine, 2013; MacRae & Donahue, 2013; Hodgson, 2012; RTPI, 2010) and the key food system actors interviewed see it as necessary for fostering the innovation required to plan for sustainable healthy food secure communities. This report is rooted in Participatory Action Research (Rennie & Singh, 1995) as I was a CIP Board Member in the position of Student Representative, conducting twenty-six interviews with key planning for food systems actors from across Canada, CIP Board Members and CIP Staff, completing a preliminary literature review on the planning discourse on food systems, and developing a variety of annotated bibliographies on planning for food systems, the results of which {{can be found in the}} appendices of this report. The links between planning and food systems have been made by numerous planning organizations including the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the Commonwealth Association of Planners, the Royal Town Planning Institute and the American Planning Association. (See Appendix A for a list of planning institute reports on planning for food systems.) However, in spite of all this, many Canadian planners and members of the general public do not have a strong understanding of the multifunctional synergies planning has with food systems change and how to utilize these to achieve existing planning goals such as sustainable community development (Personal Communication: Wayne Roberts PhD., food policy analyst & former Manager of the Toronto Food Policy Council (TFPC), April 02, 2014; Lauren Baker PhD, current Coordinator/Manager of the TPFC May 05, 2014; Janine de la Salle Registered Professional Planner (RPP) and leader in planning for food systems, April 03, 2014; Rod MacRae PhD, food policy analyst & leader in food systems thinking, May 09, 2014; Kimberley Hodgson RPP and leader in planning for food systems, May 06, 2014; and, John Turvey RPP, co-founder of Planning for Agriculture and Food Network (PAFN) & Policy specialist on land use planning for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, March 24, 2014). Please see Appendix B for a list of individuals Interviewed and their relevant background information. Wegener et al, supports the need for planners to have increased access to networking, knowledge sharing and professional development with their statement that "food system considerations are relatively new to planners. There is a need to examine the current policies and practices that may be hindering supportive local planning activity. " (2013, p 94) This report explores: • The history and importance of CIP and Provincial and Territorial Institutes and Associations (PTIAs) engaging with food systems, and engagement from similar organizations such as the American Planning Association (APA), the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), and the Commonwealth Association of lanners (CAP); • Why a Platform is Needed Under the Aegis of CIP; • The multifunctional ways that a Planning for Food Systems platform fits CIP's recently accepted <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Continuance</b> and the associated Consensus Statement, CIP's Strategic Plan and CIP's National Initiatives Committee Mandate; • The benefits of a CIP based platform to support members and the planning community on the emerging topic of planning for food systems; • The willingness and capacity of CIP's membership to support planning for food systems knowledge sharing, networking and professional development; • Potential Platform Activities and Outputs; • Current Projects for Potential Partnership; • Potential Topic Areas for Exploration by a CIP Planning for Food Systems Platform and partnership opportunities, particularly the Planning for Agriculture and Food Network (PAFN); • Key platform organizational elements; • Key qualities and skill sets of potential platform committee members; • Key groups to consult with; • Potential ways to increase capacity through the organizational design of the platform; and, • Suggested next steps for developing a proposal to CIP for the implementation of a Planning for Food Systems Platform in the form of a CIP Subcommittee. The research explored in this report clearly shows that as a national organization representative of the planning profession CIP should develop the role of planners in food systems and support the validity of planning for food systems. As such undertakings help CIP fulfill its vision of "Improved quality of life through excellence in professional planning," its mission "to advance planning in Canada and abroad by serving, educating, informing and engaging our members," and CIP values of "integrity, innovation, (and) collaboration. " (CIP, 2014, a) CIP's new <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Continuance</b> were accepted by its membership and enacted on July 07, 2014 at CIP's Annual General Meeting in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Then Articles changed CIP's name from the Canadian Institute of Planners to the Canadian Institute of Planning. Within the articles was an approved Consensus Statement which speaks to CIP's primary purpose being "to promote and advance the value of planning in Canada. " (2014, b) This report explains how the proposed platform supports the renewal of CIP and its ability to achieve its primary purpose. Based on an organizational analysis, participation in the Board of Directors, and interviews with twenty-six key actors all of whom agree that CIP should be engaging with food systems, I conclude that the capacity and validity exist for CIP to facilitate a national planning for food systems platform and through this provide knowledge sharing, networking, and professional development...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{determinant}} <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> {{intention to}} use e-book among higher education students. The determinants used in this paper are adopted from Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectancy Disconfirmation Theory (EOT). The study employed a random sampling method where email invitation which contained a hypertext link of the survey page, enables the participants to access to the survey hosted in Google Drive. Out of 760 sample size, a total of 650 responses were gathered with 509 valid responses. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis is used for data analysis to test the relationship between determinants in the model. The finding demonstrates that determinant <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> {{intention to use}} e-book are based on Satisfaction, while Satisfaction is strongly determined by Perceived Ease of Use and Confirmation of using e-book. Internet self-efficacy {{is reported to have}} strong effect on Satisfaction through Perceived Ease of Use, while Perceived Quality affects Satisfaction of using ebook through Confirmation. In general, findings from this study are beneficial for libraries as determinants <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> intention <b>of</b> using e-books could also be used in selecting and evaluating features of e-books before subscription. Additionally, e-book vendors could use these findings to improve and enhance features of their e-books services...|$|R

40|$|Researchers have {{disagreed}} recurrently {{over the}} last fifteen years concerning the nature <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> commitment, as developed within the Meyer and Allen paradigm. The core issue is whether continuance commitment is properly construed as a uni- or- multi-dimensional construct. To address this, we examined whether the CCS “low alternatives ” subscale reflects an aspect <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> commitment or whether it actually taps a construct known as “perceived employment alternatives. ” Edward’s (2001) analytical strategy was used to empirically examine models specifying CCS low alternatives, CCS high sacrifice components, and PEA items as possible dimensions of superordinate, aggregate, and multivariate-structural multidimensional constructs. CFA and SEM analysis suggested that (1) continuance commitment is not a multidimensional construct, (2) that the “high sacrifices” subscale alone taps continuance commitment, and (3) the CCS “low alternatives ” subscale measures neither continuance commitment nor perceived job alternatives. Implications for further exploration <b>of</b> the <b>continuance</b> commitment construct are discussed. Among concepts of organizational commitment based on Becker’s (1960) theory of commitment resulting from the incurrence of “side bets ” that bind the employee to the organization, the continuance commitment construc...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} rising concern that adverse effects of the recent global {{economic}} downturn spread across East Asia through international production networks. With a drastic drop in final demand, mutual ties built through supply chains would bring a synchronized contraction of trade flows across countries {{taking part in the}} production networks; however, trade relationships within the networks appear to be stable and resistant to the shocks due to relation-specific nature of the transactions. This paper highlights that transactions of intermediate goods within production networks face a higher probability <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> compared to other transactions. Moreover, the paper presents the resilience of East Asian production networks even in face of the Asian financial and currency crisis back in 1997 - 98. To this end, survival analysis is conducted using the country-product level trade data, which enables us to reveal the probability <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> once a trade relationship is established and the probability of recovery after the transaction is broken off...|$|R
40|$|The aim <b>of</b> this <b>article</b> is {{to provide}} {{empirical}} evidence on two questions belonging to the research agenda of organizational commitment research: the possible existence of several facets <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> commitment, and <b>of</b> non-linear relationships between organizational commitment and various organizational behaviors and their predictors, such as turnover and intention to leave the organization. An empirical research through a survey with 241 respondents has been carried out, and hypotheses have been tested through hierarchic linear regression. The results obtained confirm the relationship between affective commitment and intention to leave found in previous research, {{and the existence of}} two distinct components <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> commitment. There have not been found non-linear relationships between organizational commitment and the intention to leave the organization. One of the most important managerial implications of this research is that in order to reduce turnover, human resource managers should foster affective and continuance organizational commitment among the employees.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop a multidimensional measure <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> organizational commitment, specifying dimensions for continuance commitment based on the perception of beneficial economic exchanges versus the perception of low job alternatives. Design/Methodology/Approach: Three studies, which surveyed employees from various organizations, were conducted in order to find support for our conceptualization. Study 1 involved the development of new survey measures. Study 2 examined the ability of two dimensions <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> commitment to predict related job perceptions, while Study 3 examined the ability of our scales to predict supervisor-reported performance. FindingsWe generally found that continuance commitment based on economic exchanges was related favorably to work phenomena, such as task performance and citizenship behaviors, while continuance commitment based on low job alternatives was related unfavorably. Importantly, the two dimensions predicted outcomes incremental to affective and normative commitment. Implications: Our findings suggest both a positive and negative side to continuance commitment. Therefore, continuance commitment based on economic exchanges should be fostered, while continuance commitment based on low job alternatives should be minimized. Organizations may be able to leverage these results by increasing employee awareness of the benefits available to them and by providing support to employees who feel trapped in the organization. Originality/Value: Our study provides a new way of conceptualizing the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> commitment and highlights the practical benefit of doing so. When conceptualized as such, it is clear that continuance commitment aids in the prediction of organizational phenomena incremental to affective and normative commitment...|$|R

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright EmeraldThe {{purpose of this study}} is to clarify the {{theoretical}} problem and identify factors that could explain the level <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> intentions towards e-shopping. It aims to propose a revised technology acceptance model that integrates expectation confirmation theory to measure age differences with regard to continuance intentions towards e-shopping in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: The sample (n= 465) consists of 68. 8 per cent women and 31. 4 per cent men, 348 younger than 35 years old and 117 older than 35. A structural equation model confirms model fit. The model explains 65 per cent of the intention to continue shopping online. Findings- Perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and subjective norms are determinants <b>of</b> online shopping <b>continuance.</b> The structural weights are mostly equivalent between the young and old groups, but the regression path from subjective norms to perceived usefulness is not invariant, with that relationship being stronger for the younger respondents. Research limitations/implications- The research findings imply that usefulness and subjective norm contribute to continuance intentions to some extent, but it is enjoyment that leads to a higher level <b>of</b> <b>continuance</b> intentions. Online strategies cannot ignore either the direct or the indirect effects on continuance intentions in Saudi Arabia. Originality/value- The paper adds to the understudied area <b>of</b> online shopping <b>continuance</b> intentions in the Arab World in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular, by examining the effects of usefulness, enjoyment, and subjective norms on continuance intentions...|$|R
