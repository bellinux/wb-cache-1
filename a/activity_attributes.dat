In this paper we describe the results of a stated adaptation experiment held among a large sample of individuals through a web-based questionnaire, to estimate parameters of such dynamic behaviour. In the experiment subjects indicated their response to a reduction in available time for a planned activity in a number of hypothetical situations. A mixed logit model was used to estimate subjective preferences for adapting in certain ways conditional upon <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> and socioeconomic variables. The results indicate that location and transport-mode adaptations are rare compared with duration adjustment or postponing (or cancelling) the activity, dependent on the relative size of reduced time.

40|$|Activity-based {{approaches}} have taken hold in transportation research {{over the last}} several decades. The foundation of the activity-based approach is to view travel {{as a result of our}} activity choices and scheduling decisions. Therefore, better understanding of activity choice, planning time horizons, and <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> will lead to more accurate demand forecasts. This dissertation extends the current activity choice modeling framework by incorporating the characteristics of the individuals' schedules, planning time horizons and focusing on the salient attributes of the activities. This study consists of three parts which are linked to one another by their conceptual and empirical findings. The first part identifies the determinants of the planning time horizons - defined as when people decide about performing their activities. Several household and individual characteristics, and <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> are tested for their association with planning times. The <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> which have significant impacts on the planning time horizons of the activities are used in the second part for generating new activity groups. The second part clusters activities based on their salient attributes, such as duration, frequency, number of involved people and flexibilities, rather than their functional types (work, leisure, household obligations, etc.) and creates activity groups such as "long, infrequent, personally committed activities", "quick, spatially fixed, temporally flexible activities" etc. The activity groups generated in this part inform the activity choice modeling structure developed in the third part. The main analytical techniques used in this research are the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and discrete choice models. PCA is used to define the new activity groups. The analysis of the planning time horizons and activity choice are performed by mixed logit models. The model results reveal the significant relationships between socio-demographics, temporal characteristics, travel, and characteristics of the schedules on activity choice. The findings of these models could be integrated in the activity choice modules of the existing activity-travel simulation models by either applying the comprehensive model (which may face limitations due to the availability of data) or integrating the findings of the models in the decision rules...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{image and}} video {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} problems in the field of computer vision. Traditionally, the research in this area focused on extracting low level features from images and videos and learning classifiers to categorize these features to pre-defined classes of objects, scenes or activities. However, {{it is well known that}} there exists a ``semantic gap'' between low level features and high level semantic concepts, which greatly obstructs the progress of research on image and video understanding. Our work departs from the traditional view of image and video understanding in that we add a middle layer between high level concepts and low level features, which is called as attribute, and use this layer to facilitate the description of concepts and detection of entities from images and videos. On one hand, attributes are relatively simple and thus can be more reliably detected from the low level features; on the other hand, we can exploit high level knowledge about the relationship between the attributes and the high level concepts and the relationship among attributes, and therefore reduce the semantic gap. Our ideas are demonstrates in three applications as follows: First, we presented an attribute-based learning approach for object recognition, where attributes are used to transfer knowledge on object properties from known classes to unknown classes and consequently reduce the number of training examples needed to learn the new object classes. Next, we illustrate an active framework to recognize scenes based on the objects therein, which are considered as the attributes of the scenes. The active framework utilizes the correlation among objects in a scene and thus significantly reduces the number of objects to be detected in order to recognize the scene. Finally, we propose a novel approach to detect the <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> from sports videos, where the contextual constraints are explored to decrease the ambiguity in attribute detection. The <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> enable us to go beyond naming the activity categories and achieve a fine-grained description of the activities in the videos...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) theory (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1985, 1988, 1999) to examine hotel outsourcing. The study {{focuses on the}} {{uncertainty}} and frequency attributes, two of three <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> that TCE theorists see as affecting the propensity to outsource. Findings relating to the third TCE activity attribute, asset specificity, are reported in Lamminmaki (2005). Qualitative data was collected by interviewing fifteen senior managers in large hotels. While several observations made supported the frequency tenet of TCE, which holds that frequently and extensively conducted activities will be outsourced to a low extent, two specific departures were noted. These departures resulted in the proposition of an extension to the TCE frequency tenet. The TCE doctrine also holds that uncertain activities will be outsourced to a low extent. Again, although observations made supported this view, one specific observation that contradicted the theory was noted.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{consist of}} small {{autonomous}} electronic devices that sense environmental conditions and communicate over wireless links. WSNs have applications in various fields {{of science and}} technology, which are diverse and typically exist in remote areas with harsh conditions. This makes testing and debugging of applications time consuming, costly and sometimes even impossible for application developers. Hence, simulators are used to develop and test WSN applications to verify the functionality of applications without actual deployment and to avoid debugging and testing costs. Selection of a feasible simulator for WSN application development requires analysis and comparison of available WSN simulators. A feasible simulator fulfils application requirements and presents related features. Existing comparison surveys and articles present {{strengths and weaknesses of}} WSN simulators. They do not concentrate on the attributes of simulators, which an application developer should consider in selecting a feasible WSN simulator before application development. In this thesis, WSN simulators are analyzed and their attributes are collected, which can be used in selecting a feasible simulator for application development. Three types of attributes are collected: 1) <b>activity</b> <b>attributes,</b> 2) basic attributes, 3) core attributes. <b>Activity</b> <b>attributes</b> present how active and up-to-date the WSN simulators are. Basic attributes specify the type, category and development language of WSN simulators. Core attributes present the availability of core WSN requirements such as, scalability, consumed power and memory calculation modules in simulators. Seven simulators are compared using these attributes. Requirements for typical WSN applications are defined and consist of multi-hop routing, calculation of execution time, power and memory consumption of nodes. The feasibilities of the simulators are measured against the application requirements. COOJA meets all the requirements and seems feasible for WSN application development and testing. Feasibility of COOJA simulator is verified experimentally by developing three test applications. In the first application, COOJA simulates multi-hop network and provides four types of statistics, which are network, power, sensor and topology statistics. In the second application, COOJA measures power and memory consumption. In the third application, power consumption is measured for each function call of the application program. COOJA fulfils all requirements and is found feasible for WSN application development and testing...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} the interaction between people’s Internet use and their activity-travel patterns from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Although empirical studies have made great progress on generalizing the impact of the Internet on people’s daily activity-travel patterns, very few studies have successfully investigated why and how the observed patterns are generated. One {{reason for this is that}} the traditional space-time prism cannot accommodate important <b>activity</b> <b>attributes</b> besides space and time, such as activity types and location types. In addition, it is inappropriate to simplify Internet users ’ space-time paths as single lines in that they can be “present ” at different spatial scales simultaneously. Based upon previous theoretical frameworks, this study attempts to employ geo-visualization technique to explore the processes underlying people’s hybrid activity-travel patterns. An activity-Internet diary data set collected in Columbus (Ohio, USA) is used in the study. The data set provides information about respondents ’ activities and trips in the physical world as well as their Internet activities. The research results enhance our understanding of the function of the Internet in people’s daily life, and consequently will be beneficial to future quantitative modeling of hybrid activity-travel patterns. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of flour from residues of peach -palm fruit skin {{has been a}} forgotten topic from the view point of its physicochemical properties, because studies {{reported in the literature}} have focused on mesocarp flour characterization. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the physicochemical properties of the peach palm fruit epicarp flour obtained by convective drying at 60 ± 2 °C through a specific production and storage process. As a result, the flour was found to be a source of bioactive compounds, showing total phenol concentration (23. 40 ± 1. 30 mg gallic acid/ 100 g), antioxidant activity (33. 10 %± 3. 20), total carotenoids (59. 31 ± 1. 61 mg β-carotene/ 100 g), color a* (4. 95 ± 0. 58), color b* (3. 25 ± 0. 57), and luminosity (33. 95 ± 3. 16). On the other hand, there was a high level of total carotenoids (85 %) and phenolic compounds (94 %) retention after six months. Additionally, color change showed no significant difference during storage. In conclusion, the flour obtained is a byproduct with properties that can be used as an alternative to agroalimentary substitutes, mainly due to its color and antioxidant <b>activity</b> <b>attributes.</b> It is noteworthy to mention that this is one of the first studies to physicochemically characterize peach palm fruit skin flour from Valle del Cauca (Colombia) ...|$|E
