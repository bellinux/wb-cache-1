The format of a smart card is described and the impact that this format has on both the way a smart card {{can be used as}} a security module and the limitations that the smart card imposes are discussed. The security threats to smart cards, from physical to technological and environmental, are considered along with the various measures that are or can be adopted to prevent them. Further sections consider:. how the performance limitations of smart cards for cryptographic purposes may in certain circumstances, be circumvented. the use of operating system commands for application implementation and how this may be improved by use of an interpreter concept along the lines of the Java Card API. the required security functionality of a UIM in the UMTS system.

Centering, corners, edges and surface are taken into consideration, for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches and tears, when determining a trading cards value. Cards are considered poor to pristine based on their condition, or in some cases rated 1 through 10. A card in pristine condition, for example, will generally be valued higher than a card in poor condition.|$|R

The majority of games in the casino are designed to favor the “house”. This study focuses on the game of blackjack, in which players using a card counting strategy can tip the odds in their favor. A computer simulation was used to model the betting strategy of a card counter who would bet methodically. Conversely, the unpredictable betting strategy of a “normal” gambler was gathered through observations of over one thousands hands of blackjack. The comparison of the two led to deviations in behavior and betting habits. An understanding of these differences will provide a casino with additional information to catch card counters at the table...|$|R

50|$|Forecasting buying {{habits and}} {{lifestyle}} preferences {{is a process}} of data mining and analysis. This information consists of many <b>aspects</b> like credit <b>card</b> purchases, magazine subscriptions, loyalty card membership, surveys, and voter registration. Using these categories, consumer profiles can be created for any organization’s most profitable customers. When many of these potential customers are aggregated in a single area it indicates a fertile location for the business to situate. Using a drive time analysis, it is also possible to predict how far a given customer will drive to a particular location. Combining these sources of information, a dollar value can be placed on each household within a trade area detailing the likelihood that household will be worth to a company. Through customer analytics, companies can make decisions based on facts and objective data.|$|R
30|$|On {{the side}} of threats, only one Wild Card is linked to a threat, the one of road pricing, as it might reduce the market share of {{vehicles}} in urban areas. Again, there are no Wild <b>Cards</b> related to <b>aspects</b> of market shifts; experts seem not to consider this field equally important to technological or political <b>aspects.</b> Thus, Wild <b>Cards,</b> disruptive events or unexpected developments which might bring up certain threats due to market shifts may be overlooked—although they might be of greater relevance then unexpected events in other fields. Thus, {{there is a need}} to raise awareness of economic and market related Wild Cards. Also additional analysis in this field is recommended. Especially where identified Wild Cards can not be linked to threats and opportunities or the other way around, blind spots in the experts perspective are likely to be the reason.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with different <b>aspects</b> of JAVA <b>CARD</b> application {{development and use of}} formal methods in the JAVA CARD world. JAVA CARD is a technology that provides means to program smart (chip) cards with (a subset of) the JAVA language. The use of formal methods in the JAVA CARD context is highly justified due to the criticality of JAVA CARD applications. First of all, JAVA CARD applications are usually security critical (e. g., authentication, electronic cash), second, they are cost critical (i. e. they are distributed in large amounts making updates quite difficult) and finally, they can also be legally critical (e. g., when the digital signature law is considered). Thus the robustness and correctness of JAVA CARD applications should be enforced by the best means possible, i. e. by the use of formal verification techniques. At the same time JAVA CARD seems to be a good target for formal verification—due to the relative simplicity of JAVA CARD applications (as compared to full JAVA), formal verification becomes a feasible and manageable task.

30|$|Some topics, rather {{frequently}} {{described in}} publications and also {{mentioned in the}} interviews and brainstorming sessions, may be currently perceived as “not so wild”, or as emerging issues rather than Wild Card—for instance, driverless cars. This {{is related to the}} expert-based approach; the selection of Wild Cards reflects the perspective and mindset of experts including what they consider as wild. In other words limitation of Wild Cards “wildness” is based on limited imaginativeness of extreme events in the experts’ mind. Following an open scientific-based approach, this needs to be accepted as a result itself. Effort was made to add a somewhat “wilder” dimension—in the case of driverless cars we added the banning of human driven cars (see the full description of Wild Card No. 8). The distinction between “emerging issues” and “Wild Cards” is discussed, for example, in van Rij (2013). The limitations were addressed in later steps whereby Wild Cards were combined with the results of a SWOT analysis, helping to identify systemic <b>aspects</b> of Wild <b>Cards</b> in interaction with ongoing trends as well as overlooked areas, which would need to be further investigated.|$|R
50|$|The player {{generates a}} party of up to three {{characters}}; more characters can be recruited and swapped in and out between modules. Characters are selected by class, which determine equipment type they can use, and race, which grant special bonuses during combat. Each character has a deck of 36 cards which are determined by class, race, and their current equipment. Initially, the amount of equipment each character carries is limited, but as the characters gain experience points, they gain more equipment slots, expanding the abilities through new cards that enter their deck, allowing players to customize their characters. Equipment can only be swapped out between battles, and various stores, with both normal stock and time-limited exclusives, {{can be used to}} buy and sell equipment and treasure at this time. Card Hunter has a microtransaction ability to spend real-world money as to gain access to better loot from the end of encounters or to open prize chests that contain random equipment. As such, the game is considered to combine the collectable <b>card</b> <b>aspects</b> of Magic the Gathering with the role-player concepts of Dungeons & Dragons.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} two <b>aspects</b> {{of credit}} <b>card</b> repayment decisions: {{the extent to}} which the anchoring effect of minimum repayment information may be mitigated by information on alternative anchors, specifically repayments that would repay the balance in two years (Study 1) or nine months (Study 2); and the role of future repayment concern. In two experiments, three realistic credit card statements were presented with different outstanding balances. Participants, who were randomly allocated to one of four information conditions depending on supplementary information provided on the statements, stated how much they would repay that month. They were then asked about concerns they would have about repayment difficulties if they had a fixed consumer loan over three years. In Study 1 the alternative two-year repayment anchor had a negative effect on percent repayment, whereas in Study 2 the nine-month repayment anchor had a significant positive effect, especially for those with higher future repayment concern. Also, in both studies, future repayment concern had a direct inverse effect on repayment decisions which partially mediated the effect of disposable income. It is concluded that the addition to credit card statements of a table of cost and duration information for a range of repayment amounts may usefully support repayment decisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} school inputs on labor market {{outcomes}} {{is an important}} and controversial topic, both in the United States and in developing countries. A large literature about American schools has not settled debate on the issue. Card and Krueger (1992) estimate the effect of pupil/teacher ratios and teachers’ salaries on the rate of return to education for men born between 1920 and 1950, observed in the 1980 census. Controlling for state of birth effects, state of residence effects, and differences in returns to education between regional labor markets, they find a large, negative and significant effect of pupil/teacher ratios on the rate of return to education. Hanushek et al. (1996) and Heckman et al. (1996) challenge <b>aspects</b> of the <b>Card</b> and Krueger analysis. Hanushek et al. notes that {{the level at which}} school characteristics are aggregated affects the estimation results, and claims that aggregation biases upward estimated school quality effects. Heckman et al., replicating the Card and Krueger results in the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses, makes clear the importance of allowing for non-linearities in the returns to education when estimating the impact of school resources, and of allowing for differences in the impact of school quality across labor markets. They find school quality effects are weak for those with exactly 12 years of schooling, and strong only for those who attend college. Card and Krueger (1996) present a thorough review and discussion of this literature, but debate on how to interpret the literature on American schools is far from settled. ...|$|R

JAVA CARD is atechnology that provides means to program smart (chip) cards with (a subset of) the JAVA language. The use of formal methods in the JAVA CARD contextis highly justified due to the criticality of J AVA CARD applications. First of all,J AVA CARD applications are usually security critical (e. g., authentication, elec-tronic cash), second, they are cost critical (i. e. they are distributed in large amounts making updates quite difficult) and finally, {{they can also be}} legallycritical (e. g., when the digital signature law is considered). Thus the robustness and correctness of JAVA CARD applications should be enforced by the best meanspossible, i. e. by the use of formal verification techniques. At the same time J AVAC ARD seems to be a good target for formal verification [...] due to the relative sim-plicity of J AVA CARD applications (as compared to full JAVA), formal verificationbecomes a feasible and manageable task. In this thesis, we touch upon different levels of JAVA CARD application development and the use of formal methods. We start by defining a UML/OCL supported development process specifically tailored to JAVA CARD applications, then we go on to define an extension to thelogic used in formal verification of J AVA CARD programs to handle so called &quot;ripout &quot; properties (properties that should be maintained in case of an unexpected termination of a JAVA CARD program), which are specific to JAVA CARD. Finally,we end up with a simple tool support for J AVA CARD program compilation andtesting inside a CASE tool. The thesis contains three papers focusing on these aspects.
