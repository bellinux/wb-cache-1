Pioneered by Bloom, Hutson, and He, Appreciative <b>Advising</b> is fully student centered and shows great promise in helping students {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds achieve academic success. Bloom, Hunter, and He expanded on the 4 -D model of Appreciative Inquiry to develop the six phases of Appreciative <b>Advising</b> – Disarm, Discover, Dream, Design, Deliver, and Don’t Settle.

Lastly, suggestions for {{improving the quality of}} academic <b>advising</b> for elementary education majors are examined. Twenty-five elementary education majors of senior standing admitted to the College of Education and twelve elementary education faculty advisors are individually administered an oral semi-structured questionnaire. Interview responses are categorized according {{to the five}} functions of academic <b>advising,</b> the unique <b>advising</b> needs of elementary education majors, <b>advising</b> needs which are currently being met, <b>advising</b> needs which are not being met, and suggestions for improving the quality of academic <b>advising.</b> The findings indicate that those <b>advising</b> needs which are specific to elementary education majors are contained within the functions of providing accurate information and long-range program planning.

How the system called <b>Advising</b> by Computer Expert System (ACES) worked and the effects of this system on <b>advising</b> were tested. The development of an instrument to measure student satisfaction with <b>advising,</b> and the overall effects of the system with relation to student satisfaction and other intervening variables including sex, age, grade point average, cultural background, class standing, number of times the student met with their advisor, and length of time per advisor meeting were also tested. The study was done using two groups. Each had previously been <b>advised</b> in the traditional question/answer manual method of <b>advising</b> for registration. One group (experimental) used ACES in the <b>advising</b> process, while the other group (control) followed the traditional/manual process.
