5|$|Poling took severe {{punishment}} {{from very}} accurate bombing. Since Ventnor radar station had been knocked out <b>already,</b> <b>this</b> attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly less reliable. In fact, Poling was so badly damaged it was out of action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile radar station at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near Poling anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and Poling were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at Poling up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E

The receivers' report, issued in June 1880, indicated total liabilities of US$145,494,005. Annual carrying charges were just over US$7.5 million, while net revenues were just under US$5.5 million. <b>Already,</b> <b>this</b> early into the process, the English bondholders' committee contended that expansions in the Reading's floating debt incurred during the six {{months prior to the}} bankruptcy were not covered by value in the corporation's assets.|$|E

25|$|The oldest remains {{found in}} Syria {{date from the}} Palaeolithic era (c.800,000 BCE). On 23 August 1993 a joint Japan-Syria {{excavation}} team discovered fossilized Paleolithic human remains at the Dederiyeh Cave some 400km north of Damascus. The bones found in this massive cave were those of a Neanderthal child, estimated to have been about two years old, {{who lived in the}} Middle Palaeolithic era (ca. 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). Although many Neanderthal bones had been discovered <b>already,</b> <b>this</b> was practically the first time that an almost complete child's skeleton had been found in its original burial state.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. <b>Already</b> <b>this</b> couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, though I begged hard to take them out of the hot tent.

So the white fabric plays a central role: The movement of the cloth in the wind is already the main subject, the shore area between the water and beach has no clear contours and the whole picture is bathed in the light of early evening.|$|E

25|$|On 3 May 2015, The Economist {{published}} a report outlining Pakistan's economic performance. It highlighted that Pakistan's economic performance {{said that the}} economy will grow by 4.7% next year, the fastest rate in eight years. Consumer prices rose by 2.5% in between January to March 2015, the smallest increase {{for more than a}} decade. Twice <b>already</b> <b>this</b> year the central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate. It said that the government of Nawaz Sharif takes some credit for the economy's new stability. It has stuck to an IMF programme agreed to in 2013, a few months after it came to power in Pakistan's first-ever handover from one civilian government to another. Foreign-exchange reserves have more than doubled, to $17.7billion.|$|E
25|$|Chrissie Wellington {{has said}} she has two passions in life: sport and development. In her victory speech at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she {{referred}} to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked around for years through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's why she was in Nepal. <b>Already</b> <b>this</b> year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E
25|$|In the {{literature}} on the Vietnam War, Cedar Falls is evaluated much more negatively. Phillip Davidson {{is one of the few}} authors who sees it as part of a meaningful broader strategy. While he concedes that Cedar Falls missed some of its short-term goals, he holds that, along with its follow-up Operation Junction City, it had beneficial long term strategic consequences: It dealt a serious blow to the North Vietnamese strategy of protracted guerilla warfare by permanently driving the NLF's main force from the more populated areas and across the Cambodian border. <b>Already</b> <b>this</b> conclusion, however, is contested by Shelby L. Stanton. He notes the same effect as does Davidson but interprets it as detrimental to the American military strategy. Instead of driving the Vietcong into a more “vulnerable posture”, as had been intended by MACV, they were in fact driven into Cambodia and hence into a region beyond the allied forces’ reach where, together with the North Vietnamese Army, they established sanctuaries immune to US attacks.|$|E

25|$|While the IRB was {{instrumental}} in the establishment of the Volunteers, they were never able to gain complete control of the organisation. This was compounded after John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, took an active interest. Though some well known Redmond supporters had joined the Volunteers, the attitude of Redmond and the Party was largely one of opposition, though by the Summer of 1914, it was clear the IPP needed to control the Volunteers if they were not to be a threat to their authority. The majority of the IV members, like the nation as a whole, were supporters of Redmond (though this was not necessarily true of the organisation's leadership), and, armed with this knowledge, Redmond sought IPP influence, if not outright control of the Volunteers. Negotiations between MacNeil and Redmond over the latter's future role continued inconclusively for several weeks, until on 9 June Redmond issued an ultimatum, through the press, demanding the Provisional Committee co-opt twenty-five IPP nominees. With several IPP members and their supporters on the committee <b>already,</b> <b>this</b> would give them a majority of seats, and effective control.|$|E
25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate <b>already.</b> <b>This</b> {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E
