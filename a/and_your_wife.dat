500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it.

2500|$|In February 1174, Ponce {{was with}} the court of Alfonso VIII at Toledo for a major {{gathering}} the kingdom's leading men. In June, he and Estefanía visited the Benedictine monastery at Sahagún, in Castile near the border with León, where they donated an estate at Villalba de la Loma (part of the tenancy of Mayorga) {{in exchange for the}} Hospital de Don García. By October he had joined the court of Ferdinand II at Ciudad Rodrigo, where the king officially declared their reconciliation by granting [...] "to you, my beloved Count Ponce, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife,</b> the countess Doña Estefanía" [...] a privilege exempting the couple from taxes on all their lands and exempting all their vassals from taxes also. On 18 November, Ponce met Alfonso VIII at Fuentedueña, perhaps remaining with the court until 9 May 1175, when he was definitely in attendance at Medina del Campo. The last records of Ponce alive date from June, when he was in León.|$|E
