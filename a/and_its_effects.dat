5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First French Republic. He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth was a {{difficult}} one, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> would be visible in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a character in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
5|$|Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime is a 2001 American {{documentary}} film in which actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy discuss the Star Trek science fiction franchise <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on their lives. Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters James T. Kirk and Spock respectively in the , the , and their film sequels. They talk about differences they had with Gene Roddenberry, {{the creator of}} Star Trek, and about the strained relationships between Shatner {{and some of the}} other cast members. It was in this film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with alcoholism while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E

In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme. The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation constants Ki or Ki', respectively.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the death}} of his young {{daughter}} from leukaemia in 1992, Gunn has been extensively involved in fundraising to combat the disease <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects.</b> As of 2011 he has raised more than £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects {{to improve the lives of}} children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about Dylan, a {{depressed}} college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan {{will be allowed to}} live one more month for every person he kills. Brubaker said he chose to make the character young because he wanted to include the optimism of youth. The comic examines the consequences of vigilante violence <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on Dylan’s loved ones. The story debuted to mostly positive reviews. Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on the bike, the rider, and safety. An {{important factor in}} any vibration analysis is {{a comparison of the}} natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature {{is of paramount importance}} because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> vary considerably {{in the details}} but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning {{of the first day}} was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In {{the middle of the day}} an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, {{the eruption}} was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E

5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the Northern Marianas Islands, where it left US$2.5million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114homes. The damage {{was enough to}} warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4million in damage. About 250,000people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left ¥4.08billion (US$36.9million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322mm (52.0in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29people and caused ¥94.9billion (US$854million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon {{affected the}} Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped {{the equivalent of the}} monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35people, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> were significant enough for the name to be retired.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
