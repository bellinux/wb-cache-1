2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and <b>allow</b> <b>your</b> characters eloquence, [...] "and not chop them down to what you think is the right size." ...|$|E

2500|$|Forget for a {{few minutes}} that you are reading a copy of your evening paper. <b>Allow</b> <b>your</b> {{imagination}} to carry you to the gentle slope of a moon-lit Spanish hill. Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, fleecy clouds are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as through [...] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is unobstructed by pillars. he balcony being of cantilever construction removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to sit behind one.|$|E
