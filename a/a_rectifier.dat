5|$|In his preface, Merrifield {{noted that}} while archaeologists {{studying}} prehistoric periods have paid increasing {{attention to the}} evidence for ritual and magic in the archaeological record, their counterparts working in later historical periods have failed to follow their lead. Presenting this book as <b>a</b> <b>rectifier,</b> he outlines his intentions and the study's limitations.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models <b>a</b> <b>rectifier,</b> which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Rectifier {{circuits}} {{are often}} classified {{by the number}} of current pulses that flow to the DC side of the rectifier per cycle of AC input voltage. <b>A</b> single-phase half-wave <b>rectifier</b> is <b>a</b> one-pulse circuit and <b>a</b> single-phase full-wave <b>rectifier</b> is <b>a</b> two-pulse circuit. <b>A</b> three-phase half-wave <b>rectifier</b> is <b>a</b> three-pulse circuit and <b>a</b> three-phase full-wave <b>rectifier</b> is <b>a</b> six-pulse circuit.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> real <b>rectifier</b> {{characteristically}} drops part of {{the input}} voltage (a voltage drop, for silicon devices, of typically 0.7 volts plus an equivalent resistance, in general non-linear)—and at high frequencies, distorts waveforms in other ways. Unlike <b>an</b> ideal <b>rectifier,</b> it dissipates some power.|$|R
40|$|The {{esterification}} of {{lauric acid}} and methanol is explored using a thermally coupled distillation sequence with <b>a</b> side <b>rectifier</b> and the Petlyuk distillation column. The {{study was conducted}} using as a design tool a multi objective genetic algorithm with restrictions. The product of the esterification {{can be used as}} biodiesel. It was found that the thermally coupled distillation sequence involving <b>a</b> side <b>rectifier</b> can produce biodiesel with a high purity (around 0. 999) and also pure water, and the excess of methanol is recovered in <b>a</b> side <b>rectifier.</b> The results indicate that the energy consumption of the complex distillation sequence with <b>a</b> side <b>rectifier</b> can be reduced significantly by varying operational conditions. These reductions in energy consumption can be interpreted as reductions in carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R
25|$|Rectifiers {{are also}} used for {{detection}} of amplitude modulated radio signals. The signal may be amplified before detection. If not, a very low voltage drop diode or a diode biased with a fixed voltage must be used. When using <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> for demodulation the capacitor and load resistance must be carefully matched: too low a capacitance makes the high frequency carrier pass to the output, and too high makes the capacitor just charge and stay charged.|$|E
25|$|Arcing between tube {{elements}} {{can destroy}} the tube. An arc {{can be caused}} by applying voltage to the anode (plate) before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing excess current through <b>a</b> <b>rectifier,</b> which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any loose material inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{moving coil}} meter is {{suitable}} only for direct current measurements, {{usually in the}} range of 10 microamperes to 100mA. It is easily adapted to read heavier currents by using shunts (resistances in parallel with the basic movement) or to read voltage using series resistances known as multipliers. To read alternating currents or voltages, <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> is needed. One of the earliest suitable rectifiers was the copper oxide rectifier developed and manufactured by Union Switch & Signal Company, Swissvale, Pennsylvania, later part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, from 1927.|$|E
50|$|The {{diode bridge}} can be {{generalized}} to rectify polyphase AC inputs. For example, for a three-phase AC input, <b>a</b> half-wave <b>rectifier</b> consists of three diodes, but <b>a</b> full-wave bridge <b>rectifier</b> consists of six diodes.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>rectifier</b> used in {{high-voltage}} {{direct current}} (HVDC) power transmission systems and industrial processing between about 1909 to 1975 is a mercury-arc rectifier or mercury-arc valve. The device is enclosed in a bulbous glass vessel or large metal tub. One electrode, the cathode, is submerged {{in a pool}} of liquid mercury {{at the bottom of the}} vessel and one or more high purity graphite electrodes, called anodes, are suspended above the pool. There may be several auxiliary electrodes to aid in starting and maintaining the arc. When an electric arc is established between the cathode pool and suspended anodes, a stream of electrons flows from the cathode to the anodes through the ionized mercury, but not the other way (in principle, this is a higher-power counterpart to flame rectification, which uses the same one-way current transmission properties of the plasma naturally present in a flame).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E
2500|$|A related area of {{research}} is to develop smaller rectifiers, because a smaller device has a higher cutoff frequency. [...] Research projects are attempting to develop a unimolecular rectifier, a single organic molecule that would function as <b>a</b> <b>rectifier.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} locomotive, 6Y1-001, {{which used}} <b>an</b> ignitron-controlled <b>rectifier,</b> {{was produced in}} 1958. A further 6 prototypes (002 to 007) were produced between 1962 and 1966. <b>A</b> silicon semiconductor-controlled <b>rectifier</b> was used from No. 004 onwards.|$|R

2500|$|If the AC {{supply is}} fed via a {{transformer}} with a center tap, <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> circuit with improved harmonic performance can be obtained. [...] This rectifier now requires six diodes, one connected to {{each end of}} each transformer secondary winding.

2500|$|Later {{known as}} the Fleming valve, {{it could be used}} as <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> of {{alternating}} current and as a radio wave detector. This greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat's whisker, an adjustable point contact. Unlike modern semiconductors, such a diode required painstaking adjustment of the contact to the crystal in order for it to rectify.|$|E
25|$|For {{single-phase}} AC, if the transformer is center-tapped, {{then two}} diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form <b>a</b> full-wave <b>rectifier.</b> Twice as many turns are required on the transformer secondary {{to obtain the}} same output voltage than for <b>a</b> bridge <b>rectifier,</b> but the power rating is unchanged.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modulation}} techniques associated with the single phase pulse width modulated (PWM) <b>rectifier.</b> <b>A</b> PWM <b>rectifier</b> is obtained by replacing the diodes in <b>a</b> bridge <b>rectifier</b> with power electronic switches like MOSFET, IGBT etc. The ON/OFF instants of theses switches can be controlled to approximate input power factor to unity and reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) of input current. A MATLAB simulation of PWM rectifier using hysteresis current control technique is done using simulink and waveforms are analyzed for power factor, THD and ripple in output voltage...|$|R
2500|$|By the mid-1930s, {{commercial}} production of TRF receivers was largely replaced by superheterodyne receivers. [...] By the 1940s the vacuum-tube superheterodyne AM broadcast receiver was refined into a cheap-to-manufacture design called the [...] "All American Five", because it only used five vacuum tubes: usually a converter (mixer/local oscillator), an IF amplifier, a detector/audio amp, audio power amp, and <b>a</b> <b>rectifier.</b> [...] From this time, the superheterodyne design {{was used for}} virtually all commercial radio and TV receivers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>rectifier</b> is an {{electrical}} device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows {{in only one}} direction. The process is known as , since it [...] "straightens" [...] the direction of current. Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, semiconductor diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used. Early radio receivers, called crystal radios, used a [...] "cat's whisker" [...] of fine wire pressing on a crystal of galena (lead sulfide) {{to serve as a}} point-contact rectifier or [...] "crystal detector".|$|E
2500|$|The {{input stage}} of a CFL is <b>a</b> <b>rectifier,</b> which {{presents}} a non-linear load to the power supply and introduces harmonic distortion on the current drawn from the supply. The use of CFLs in homes has no appreciable effect on power quality, but significant quantities {{of them in a}} large facility can have an impact. The power factor of CFLs does not significantly affect their energy-saving benefits for individual consumers, but their use in large numbers—such as in commercial applications or across millions of homes in a distribution system—could require infrastructure upgrades. [...] In such cases, CFLs with low (below 30 percent) total harmonic distortion (THD) and power factors greater than 0.9 should be selected.|$|E

2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all HVDC {{converters}} {{are inherently}} bi-directional; they can convert either from AC to DC (rectification) or from DC to AC (inversion). A complete HVDC system always includes {{at least one}} converter operating as <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> (converting AC to DC) {{and at least one}} operating as an inverter (converting DC to AC). Some HVDC systems take full advantage of this bi-directional property (for example, those designed for cross-border power trading, such as the Cross-Channel link between England and France). [...] Others, for example those designed to export power from a remote power station such as the Itaipu scheme in Brazil, may be optimised for power flow in only one preferred direction. [...] In such schemes, power flow in the non-preferred direction may have a reduced capacity or poorer efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Moving coil {{instruments}} {{can respond}} {{only to the}} average value of the current through them. [...] To measure alternating current, which changes up and down repeatedly, <b>a</b> <b>rectifier</b> is inserted in the circuit so that each negative half cycle is inverted; [...] {{the result is a}} varying and non-zero DC voltage whose maximum value will be half the AC peak to peak voltage, assuming a symmetrical waveform. [...] Since the rectified average value and the root-mean-square value of a waveform are only the same for a square wave, simple rectifier-type circuits can only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms. [...] Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. This type of circuit usually has fairly limited frequency range. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low AC voltage values.|$|E
40|$|Direct-driven {{wind turbine}} {{generators}} have a high inductance compared with normal 1500 -rpm generators.

The mechanisms behind this are discussed and four different rectifiers are presented and compared. Through simulations {{it has been shown that}} <b>a</b> transistor <b>rectifier</b> utilizes the generator well and can lead to low generator currents and a constant flux linkage. An almost constant flux linkage is achievable also with a series compensated diode rectifier, while part-load currents are slightly higher than for the transistor <b>rectifier.</b> <b>A</b> plain diode <b>rectifier</b> cannot utilize the generator well and <b>a</b> shunt compensated <b>rectifier</b> leads to high flux linkage at part-load...|$|R
