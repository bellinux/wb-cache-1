40|$|Within <b>the</b> EU, {{uncertainty}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> acquiring land can {{be quite}} significant for individual farmers in sectors like dairy farming. Farm-level investment decisions are commonly made ex-ante, when the farmer is not certain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> purchasing land. This possibility is realised only in a future period. In this paper, we have developed and applied a simple two-period model in which a profit-maximising farmer, facing uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> acquiring land, has to choose the optimal mix of capital (buildings) investment and land endowment. We illustrate the model using data from Dutch dairy farms...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{fighting}} {{had not yet}} spread to the Pacific, by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> war with Japan. After {{a review of the}} defences around Singapore and Malaya, the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region. In October, the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and supporting elements. As a result, the 2/18th—with a strength of 793 men—subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941, bound for Singapore. The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, so the deployment was only intended to be short, as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May. Consequently, the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and while they were {{still in the process of}} being brought up to full strength.|$|E
5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt {{the plans for the}} Bagration were sound, he worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E
5|$|Doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{mechanistic}} {{explanation of}} thought drove René Descartes, {{and most other}} philosophers along with him, to dualism: {{the belief that the}} mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1958 Fleming and his friend, Ivar Bryce, {{began talking}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Bond film. Later that year, Bryce {{introduced}} Fleming {{to a young}} Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, {{and the three of}} them, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, formed the partnership Xanadu Productions, named after Bryce's Bahamian home, but which was never actually formed into a company. In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce's Essex house and then in McClory's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima Blush. McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Numerous titles were proposed for these works, including SPECTRE, James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West.|$|E
5|$|Pather Panchali was {{followed}} by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life—Aparajito (The Unvanquished) in 1956 and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. Together, the three films constitute the Apu trilogy. Aparajito portrays the adolescent Apu, his education in a rural school and a Calcutta college. Its central theme is the poignant relationship between a doting mother and her ambitious young son. Apur Sansar depicts Apu's adult life, his reaction to his wife's premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. The sequels also won many national and international awards. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he {{decided to make the}} third film only after being asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where Aparajito won the Golden Lion. Apur Panchali (2014) is a Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in Pather Panchali.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor to ask <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They {{then turned to the}} American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to help guide Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E

The latter ship required less than a month of repairs but Conqueror was not ready for service until March 1915.|$|E
5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had increased their share to 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers increased their shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E
5|$|The major Russian push came on July 4, after a major {{artillery}} pre-emptive assault. The advancing Russian infantry, numbering around 10,000, faced about 1,000 Polish {{troops in}} the front lines (the rest were held in reserve), but the Russians were stopped by heavy machine gun fire and forced to retreat. The Hungarian forces at Polish Hill were pushed back, however, and the Russians advancing on the Poles' right flank, threatened to take the high ground in the area. A counterattack by the Poles was not successful; as the Hungarian units were retreating, the Polish forces sustained very heavy losses and had to fall back either to the remaining {{part of the first}} defense line or, in the area of Polish Hill, to the second line. Another Polish counterattack, launched during the night of July 4/5, was also beaten back. Throughout the day, the Russian offensive managed to push the Polish forces further back; although the Poles managed to temporarily retake Polish Hill, a lack of support from the Hungarian forces once again tipped the battle towards the Russians, and even German reinforcements – deployed after Piłsudski sent a report to the army's headquarters <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Russian breakthrough – failed to turn the tide away. Eventually, on July 6, the Russian offensive forced the Central Powers' armies to retreat along the entire frontline; Polish forces were among the last to retreat, having sustained approximately 2,000 casualties during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Wasteland Angel {{was first}} {{announced}} on May 17, 2011, with a prospective release date for summer {{of the same}} year. The game was developed by Octane Games, an independent development team in Kotka, Finland that is owned by Nitro Games. The company was founded in Spring 2011, shortly after Nitro Games completed the arcade shooter Woody Two-Legs. Wasteland Angel would be their first release under the Octane Games brand. Before the release, the group had already announced the second game they were working on: a pirate role-playing game titled Raven's Cry. Although Wasteland Angel is published by Meridian4, Raven's Cry was signed {{to be published by}} TopWare Interactive. In the announcement for Wasteland Angel, the publisher noted plans to make additional downloadable content available for the game after it was launched. In an August 2011 interview, Octane Games CEO Jussi Tähtinen stated that the company was focusing on multiplatform development and that Wasteland Angel seemed in ideal fit to be marketed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but he declined to share any specific plans to bring the game to either platform. When asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multiplayer mode, Tähtinen again declined to make any announcement.|$|E
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E
