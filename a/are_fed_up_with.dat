500|$|After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi {{actively}} campaigned {{to oppose}} any {{help to the}} British war effort and any Indian participation in the war. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism. Gandhi's position was not supported by many Indian leaders, and his campaign against the British war effort was a failure. The Hindu leader, Tej Bahadur Sapru declared in 1941, states Herman, [...] "A good many Congress leaders <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the barren program of the Mahatma". Over 2.5million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined on the British side. They fought and died {{as a part of}} the allied forces in Europe, North Africa and various fronts of the World War II.|$|E

500|$|Six out {{of eight}} areas in Knowle West are ranked as being {{economically}} deprived. The {{closure of the}} Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A House of Commons report noted that this had a seriously {{negative effect on the}} area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for [...] "manual and semi-skilled employment". The Independent in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, BBC News said [...] "Knowle West has {{more than its share of}} social problems. [...] The highest number of kids in care of any council ward in Bristol. [...] The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). [...] A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> bad housing." [...] Shawnie, a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters [...] "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and nicking their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Matters {{deteriorated}} in 1929, {{when the}} three Ipswich clubs (Bundamba Rangers, Dinmore Bush Rats and St Helens) withdrew from the semi-final round, leaving only Brisbane club Latrobe. The reason given in a newspaper report was [...] "because they {{were not allowed to}} share the profits of the matches which were to have been played at the Cricket Ground." [...] However, the report also noted [...] "they were parties to the original arrangement ... The four Brisbane clubs alone are responsible for the rent of the Brisbane Cricket Ground, and these semi-finals were to help liquidate the liability." [...] Another report said [...] "the whole future of the game in this State is in the melting pot. To put the matter bluntly, the Brisbane clubs <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> these incessant rows with Ipswich, and desire to end the business once and for all ..." [...] The Ipswich clubs were fined and suspended and, despite attempts at mediation, {{were not included in the}} Brisbane competition for 1930 (see below). With the departure of the Ipswich clubs, Latrobe became the dominant team of the late 1920s and early 1930s, winning six of the seven Premierships between 1929 and 1935.|$|E

Conceding defeat, he said, “I feel very happy, and very proud” and said that he would win “next time.” Referring to his role as head of the PNI, he said, “We are now the second most important political force in Palestine, ahead of Hamas.
