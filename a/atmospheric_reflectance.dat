40|$|In this study, we {{presents}} the potentiality of retrieving Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) {{in the atmosphere}} which combined Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite and ground based closures enable the determination of required aerosol characteristics over moderate bright surfaces area of Makkah, Mina and Arafah. A multispectral algorithm was developed by assuming that surface condition of study area was lambertian and homogeneous. In-situ AOT data was calculated using Beer Lambert law from transmittance of atmospheric measured using the FieldSpec handheld spectroradiometer and their locations were determined by a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). The Digital Number (DN) recorded by satellite imageries were converted to top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance which {{is the sum of}} the ground reflectance and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance.</b> Then, the atmospheric correction (ATCOR 2) method was used to retrieve the surface reflectance. The reflectance measured from the satellite {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA) was subtracted from the amount given by the surface reflectance to obtain the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance.</b> Measured PM 10 and AOT were correlated with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> value using regression technique. Various types of regression algorithms were then examined by comparing the correlation coefficient (R) values and the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) values. The three band model of algorithm was selected based on the highest R value and the lowest RMSE value.

The objective {{of this study was}} to test the potential of an internet protocol (IP) camera digital camera for determination of particulate matter less than 10 micron (PM 10). This study provided information on air quality over USM campus area. In situ data were measured simultaneously with the acquisition of IP camera data for algorithm regression analysis. The digital image was separated into three bands assigned as red, green and blue for multispectral algorithm regression. The digital numbers were extracted corresponding to the ground-truth locations for each band and then converted to radiance and reflectance values. The digital numbers of the three bands were converted into irradiance and then reflectance. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> values was extracted from the satellite observation reflectance values subtrated by the amount given by the surface reflectance. The relationship between the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> and the corresponding air quality data was determined using regression analysis. A new algorithm was developed for detecting air pollution from the digital camera images chosen based on the highest correlation coefficient, R and lowest root mean square error, RMS for PM 10.

In regions where {{there are a lot}} of inland waters such as dams, sampling even a small proportion of those dams for monitoring and assessing water quality is cost prohibitive. Satellite remote sensing has the potential to be a powerful tool for assessing water quality over large spatial scales. The overall objective of this study was to examine whether Landsat- 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) and Landsat- 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) could be used to measure turbidity across theKourris Dam, which is the biggest dam in Cyprus. This paper presents the results obtained by applying the linear regression analysis in order to examine the relationship between the turbidity measurements measured in-situ during the satellite overpass against at-satellite <b>atmospheric</b> corrected <b>reflectance</b> values. It has been found that the <b>reflectance,</b> after <b>atmospheric</b> correction, at LandsatTMBands 1 and 3 is strongly related with turbidity levels after linear regression analysis. The most significant correlation was occurred when reflectance in TM band 3 and logarithmic reflectance in TM band 3 were correlated with turbidity measurements.

40|$|Infrared (IR) retrievals of aerosol optical {{thickness}} (AOT) are challenging {{because of the}} low reflectance of aerosol layer at longer wavelengths. In this paper we present a closer analysis of this problem, performed with radiative transfer (RT) simulations for coarse and accumulation mode of four main aerosol components. It shows the strong angular dependence of aerosol IR reflectance at low solar elevations resulting from significant asymmetry of aerosol phase function at these wavelengths. This results in detectable values of aerosol IR reflectance at certain non-nadir observation angles providing the advantage of multiangle remote sensing instruments for a retrieval of AOT at longer wavelengths. Such retrievals can be of importance e. g. {{in case of a}} very strong effect of the surface on the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the visible range of spectrum. In current work, a new method to retrieve AOT over snow has been developed using the measurements of Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) on board the ENVISAT satellite. The algorithm uses AATSR channel at 3. 7 μm and utilizes its dual-viewing observation technique implying the forward view with an observation zenith angle around 55 degrees and the nadir view. It includes cloud/snow discrimination, extraction of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> out of measured brightness temperature (BT) at 3. 7 μm, interpolation of look-up tables (LUTs) for a given aerosol reflectance. The algorithm uses LUTs, separately simulated with RT forward calculations. The resulting AOT at 500 nm is estimated from the value at 3. 7 μm using a fixed Angström parameter. The presented method has been validated against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data for 4 high Arctic stations and shows good agreement. A case study has been performed at W-Greenland on 5 July 2008. The day before was characterized by a noticeable dust event. The retrieved AOT maps of the region show a clear increase of AOT in the Kangerlussuaq area. The area of increased AOT was detected on 5 July on the ice sheet east of Kangelussuaq opposite to the observed north easterly wind at ground level. This position can be explained by a small scale atmospheric circulation transporting the mobilised mineral dust upslope, after its intrusion into the upper branch of the circulation. The performed study of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> at 3. 7 μm also shows possibilities of detection and retrievals of cloud properties over snow surface...|$|E
40|$|Measurement of the areal {{extent of}} snow cover with high {{accuracy}} {{plays an important}} role in hydrological and climate modeling. Remotely-sensed data acquired by earth-observing satellites offer great advantages for timely monitoring of snow cover. However, the main obstacle is the tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolution of satellite imageries. Soft or subpixel classification of low or moderate resolution satellite images is a preferred technique to overcome this problem. The most frequently employed snow cover fraction methods applied on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have evolved from spectral unmixing and empirical Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) methods to latest machine learning-based artificial neural networks (ANNs). This study demonstrates the implementation of subpixel snow-covered area estimation based on the state-of-the-art nonparametric spline regression method, namely, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).

In particular, the Sentinel- 2 host an instrumental payload mainly consisting in a MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imaging sensor, capable of acquiring high-resolution imagery of the Earth surface and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> at selected spectral bands, hence providing complementary measurements to ground-based radiometric stations. The latter can provide reference data for validating the estimates from spaceborne instruments such as Sentinel- 2 A (operating since October 2015), whose aerosol optical thickness (AOT) values, can be obtained from correcting SWIR (2190 nm) reflectance with an improved dense dark vegetation (DDV) algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—Retrieval of {{the surface}} {{reflectance}} {{is important in the}} remotely sensed data analysis to obtain the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> or atmospheric correction. The relationship between visible and mid infrared reflectance over land was investigated and developed in this study. The surface reflectances of the two visible bands were measured using a handheld spectroradiometer collected around Penang Island. In this study, we use the assumption that the 2. 1 µm band is not affected by aerosol and it is transparent to most aerosol types (except dust). Therefore the satellite observed signal {{is the same as the}} surface signal in 2. 1 µm band. The correlation between the surface reflectance measured by the spectroradiometer in the blue and red region and the 2. 1 µm observed by the satellite has been established. We investigate five dates of Landsat TM scenes in this study. The finding obtained by this study indicates that the surface reflectance can be retrieved from the 2. 1 µm band. II.

40|$|As <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> dominates top-of-the-atmosphere {{radiance}} over ocean, {{atmospheric correction}} {{is a critical}} component of ocean color retrievals. This paper explores the operational Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) algorithm atmospheric correction with approximately 13 000 coincident surface-based aerosol measurements. Aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD(sub 440)) is overestimated for AOD below approximately 0. 1 - 0. 15 and is increasingly underestimated at higher AOD; also, single-scattering albedo (SSA) appears overestimated when the actual value less than approximately 0. 96. AOD(sub 440) and its spectral slope tend to be overestimated preferentially for coarse-mode particles. Sensitivity analysis shows that changes in these factors lead to systematic differences in derived ocean water-leaving reflectance (Rrs) at 440 nm. The standard SeaWiFS algorithm compensates for AOD anomalies in the presence of nonabsorbing, medium-size-dominated aerosols. However, at low AOD and with absorbing aerosols, in situ observations and previous case studies demonstrate that retrieved Rrs is sensitive to spectral AOD and possibly also SSA anomalies. Stratifying the dataset by aerosol-type proxies shows the dependence of the AOD anomaly and resulting Rrs patterns on aerosol type, though the correlation with the SSA anomaly is too subtle to be quantified with these data. Retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl) are affected in a complex way by Rrs differences, and these effects occur preferentially at high and low Chl values. Absorbing aerosol effects are likely to be most important over biologically productive waters near coasts and along major aerosol transport pathways. These results suggest that future ocean color spacecraft missions aiming to cover the range of naturally occurring and anthropogenic aerosols, especially at wavelengths shorter than 440 nm, will require better aerosol amount and type constraints...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{evaluation}} of chemical transport models (CTMs) with aerosol optical depth (AOD) products retrieved from satellite backscattered reflectances can be compromised by inconsistent assumptions of aerosol optical properties and errors in surface reflectance estimates. We present an improved AOD retrieval algorithm for the MODIS satellite instrument using locally derived surface reflectances and CTM aerosol optical properties for the 0. 47, 0. 65, and 2. 13 μm MODIS channels. Assuming negligible <b>atmospheric</b> <b>reflectance</b> at 2. 13 μm in cloud-free conditions, we derive 0. 65 / 2. 13 surface reflectance ratios at 1 ° X 1. 25 ° horizontal resolution for the continental United States in summer 2004 from the subset of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data with minimal aerosol reflectance. We obtain a mean ratio of 0. 57 ± 0. 10 for the continental United States, with high values over arid regions and low values over the Midwest prairies. The higher surface reflectance ratios explain the high AOD bias over arid regions found in previous MODIS retrievals. We calculate TOA reflectances for each MODIS scene using local aerosol optical properties from the GEOS-Chem CTM, and fit these reflectances to the observed MODIS TOA reflectances for a best estimate of AODs for that scene. Comparison with coincident ground-based (AERONET) AOD observations at 16 {{sites in the}} western and central United States in summer 2004 shows poor correlation in the daily data but the correlation improves as averaging time increases. Averaging over the available coincident observations (n = 11 – 44 days) results in strong correlations (R 0. 47 μm = 0. 90, R 0. 65 μm = 0. 67) and a 19 % low bias, representing considerable improvement over the operational MODIS AOD products in this region...|$|E

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been used routinely to provide global land surface albedo. The MODIS algorithm includes <b>atmospheric</b> correction, surface <b>reflectance</b> angular modeling, and narrowband to broadband albedo conversion.

The method consists of extensive radiative transfer simulations {{for a variety of}} atmospheric and surface snow conditions and links the TOA reflectance with surface broadband albedo through regression analysis. Therefore the direct retrieval algorithm implicitly incorporates in a single step all three procedures used in the standard MODIS surface albedo algorithm. This study presents improvements to the retrieval algorithm including validation with in situ measurements distributed over the Greenland ice sheet. Comparison with surface observations demonstrates that the direct retrieval algorithm can produce very accurate daily snow/ice albedo with mean bias of less than 0. 02 and residual standard error of 0. 04...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{spectral reflectance}} characteristics of urban area materials measured with the airborne HSS (Hyperspectral Scanner System) /SIVAM. A 2. 7 m spatial resolution HSS radiance image of São José dos Campos city, in São Paulo state (Brazil), was atmospherically corrected using FLAASH algorithm to retrieve surface reflectance. An EFFORT polishing {{was applied to}} minimize artifacts due to <b>atmospheric</b> correction. Image <b>reflectance</b> spectra were compared with field and laboratory reflectance measurements (FieldSpec instrument) of different materials to assess the quality of reflectance retrieval. Results showed that HSS was able to measure typical spectral absorption features of green vegetation, soil and water bodies. From the comparison between HSS and FieldSpec measurements, some man made materials presented well-matched spectra between the two levels of data acquisition, and red ceramic tiles presented well-defined clay minerals and iron oxides spectral features. Distinction between aluminum and galvanized steel roofs was possible as well as identification of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) covers because of their typical features near 2150 nm and 2325 nm.

40|$|A timely {{low-cost}} method {{providing information}} on {{water quality and}} trophic state to various users of reservoir or dam water is a must. Conventional methods involved tedious and expensive in situ and laboratory studies. Satellite-borne sensors have the capability of providing repetitive, low-cost, multispectra, timely and reliable information over areas. This paper shows {{the development of a}} new method for assessing the trophic state in inland water bodies such as dams. The method is based on matching the <b>atmospheric</b> corrected <b>reflectance</b> values obtained from Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image data with the defined spectral signature ranges obtained from ground spectro-radiometric measurements in order to assess the trophic state conditions. The proposed method has been applied to Landsat TM and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) satellite images of the Kourris and Asprokremmos Dams in Cyprus, acquired during the winter, spring, summer and autumn period. The reflectance values for the images acquired on 3 June 1985, 11 September 1998, 11 May 2000 and 31 January 2001 for the Asprokremmos Dam were found to be 4. 5, 3. 5, 3. 7 and 11. 2 %, and those for the Kourris Dam were found to be 5, 3. 5, 3. 1 and 5. 2 %, respectively. Reflectance values between 3 and 7 % correspond to a eutrophic state and values > 7 % to a hypertrophic state. The results obtained from the proposed method were found to comply with those found using the trophic state index (TSI) approach. For example, the trophic state for the Landsat TM images of Asprokremmos Dam acquired on 11 May 2000 and 31 January 2001, was determined to be TSI= 68 and 79, respectively, using the available secchi disc depths (SDDs) and the Carlson TSI. Such values correspond to eutrophic and hypetrophic trophic states that comply with the same outcomes found from the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in the use of remotely sensed data to address global issues. With the open data policy, the data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors have become a critical component of numerous applications. These two sensors have been operational for more than a decade, providing a rich archive of multispectral imagery for analysis of mutitemporal remote sensing data. This paper focuses on evaluating the radiometric calibration agreement between MODIS and ETM+ using the near-simultaneous and cloud-free image pairs over an African pseudo-invariant calibration site, Libya 4. To account for the combined uncertainties in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance due to surface and <b>atmospheric</b> bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> distribution function (BRDF), a semiempirical BRDF model was adopted to normalize the TOA reflectance to the same illumination and viewing geometry. In addition, the spectra from the Earth Observing- 1 (EO- 1) Hyperion were used to compute spectral corrections between the corresponding MODIS and ETM+ spectral bands. As EO- 1 Hyperion scenes were not available for all MODIS and ETM+ data pairs, MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) 5. 0 simulations were also used to adjust for differences due to the presence or lack of absorption features in some of the bands. A MODIS split-window algorithm provides the atmospheric water vapor column abundance during the overpasses for the MODTRAN simulations. Additionally, the column atmospheric water vapor content during the overpass was retrieved using the MODIS precipitable water vapor product. After performing these adjustments, the radiometric cross-calibration of the two sensors was consistent to within 7 %. Some drifts in the response of the bands are evident, with MODIS band 3 being the largest of about 6 % over 10 years, a change that will be corrected in Collection 6 MODIS processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{reflectance}} of the Earth’s {{surface is}} significantly influenced by atmospheric {{conditions such as}} water vapor content and aerosols. Particularly, the absorption and scattering effects become stronger when the target features are non-bright objects, such as in aqueous or vegetated areas. For any remote-sensing approach, atmospheric correction is thus required to minimize those effects and to convert digital number (DN) values to surface reflectance. The main {{aim of this study}} was to test the three most popular atmospheric correction models, namely (1) Dark Object Subtraction (DOS); (2) Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) and (3) the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6 S) and compare them with Top of <b>Atmospheric</b> (TOA) <b>reflectance.</b> By using the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm, a series of experiments were conducted for above-ground forest biomass (AGB) estimations of the Gongju and Sejong region of South Korea, in order to check the effectiveness of atmospheric correction methods for Landsat ETM+. Overall, in the forest biomass estimation, the 6 S model showed the bestRMSE’s, followed by FLAASH, DOS and TOA. In addition, a significant improvement of RMSE by 6 S was found with images when the study site had higher total water vapor and temperature levels. Moreover, we also tested the sensitivity of the atmospheric correction methods to each of the Landsat ETM+ bands. The results confirmed that 6 S dominates the other methods, especially in the infrared wavelengths covering the pivotal bands for forest applications. Finally, we suggest that the 6 S model, integrating water vapor and aerosol optical depth derived from MODIS products, is better suited for AGB estimation based on optical remote-sensing data, especially when using satellite images acquired in the summer during full canopy development...|$|R
