50|$|Telescoping linear {{actuators}} are specialized {{linear actuators}} used where space restrictions exist. Their {{range of motion}} is many {{times greater than the}} unextended length of the <b>actuating</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{distinction}} between types of rigid chain actuator {{is whether the}} <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> is formed from a single chain or {{from a pair of}} interlocking chains in a back-to-back arrangement, like a zipper. Interlocking chain actuators have the advantages over single-chain actuators of improved resistance to buckling and that the <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> does not require lateral restraint at its leading end in order to resist a modicum of transverse loads on any edge of the member. For example, it may function as a relatively stable telescoping pole.|$|E
50|$|Rigid chain {{actuators}} {{function as}} {{rack and pinion}} linear actuators that use articulated racks. Rigid chain actuators use limited-articulation chains, usually resembling a roller chain, that engage with pinions mounted on a drive shaft within a housing. The links of the <b>actuating</b> <b>member,</b> the “rigid chain”, are articulated {{in a manner that}} they deflect from a straight line to one side only. As the pinions spin, the links of the chain are rotated 90 degrees through the housing, which guides and locks the chain into a rigid linear form effective at resisting tension and compression (buckling). Because the <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> can fold on itself, it can be stored relatively compactly in a storage magazine, either in an overlapping or coiled arrangement. Rigid chain actuators are generally driven by electric motors. Most rigid chains are manufactured from steel.|$|E
5000|$|Other more {{specialized}} telescoping actuators use <b>actuating</b> <b>members</b> {{that act as}} rigid linear shafts when extended, but break that line by folding, separating into pieces and/or uncoiling when retracted. Examples of telescoping linear actuators include: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the complete forward and inverse kinematics solutions {{for control of}} the three degree-of-freedom (DOF) double octahedral variable geometry truss (VGT) module as an extensible gimbal. A VGT is a truss structure partially comprised of linearly <b>actuated</b> <b>members.</b> A VGT can be used as joints in a large, lightweight, high load-bearing manipulator for earth- and space-based remote operations, plus industrial applications. The results have been used to control the NASA VGT hardware as an extensible gimbal, demonstrating the capability of this device to be a joint in a VGT-based manipulator. This work {{is an integral part of}} a VGT-based manipulator design, simulation, and control tool...|$|R
40|$|Tensegrity prisms are {{three-dimensional}} self-stressing {{cable systems}} {{with a relatively}} small number of disjoint compression members, invented by Buckminster Fuller. They form novel structural geometries and they constitute a class of mechanisms which have not been previously studied for possible application as variable geometry truss (VGT) manipulators. They have a number of seemingly advantageous properties [...] they are self-erecting, in that tensioning the final cable transforms them from a compact group of members into a large threedimensional volume, and they are predominately tension systems, in that they can function as a VGT manipulator while <b>actuating</b> <b>members</b> only in tension. These properties have not been explored but could be broadly useful, for applications ranging from temporary terrestrial construction to large on-orbit space stuctures. However, they have a number of properties which make them seemingly inappropriate for use [...] they are not conventionally rigid, they exist [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> for each cylinder. Each <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|E
50|$|Rigid belt {{actuators}} can {{be thought}} of as rack and pinion devices that use a flexible rack. Rigid belt actuators use two reinforced plastic ribbed belts, that engage with pinions mounted on drive shafts within a housing. The belts have evenly spaced load bearing blocks on the non-ribbed face. As the pinions spin, the belts are rotated 90 degrees through the housing, which interlocks the blocks like a zipper into a rigid linear form. The resulting beam or column is effective at resisting tension and compression (buckling). Because the <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> can fold on itself, it can be stored relatively compactly in a storage magazine, either in an overlapping or coiled arrangement. The actuator is driven by an electric motor.|$|E
40|$|An {{actuating}} device can change {{a position of}} an active member that remains in substantially the same position {{in the absence of}} a force of a predetermined magnitude on the active member. The {{actuating device}} comprises a shape-memory alloy <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> for exerting a force when actuated by changing the temperature thereof, which shape-memory alloy <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> has a portion for connection to the active member for exerting thereon a force having a magnitude at least as large as the predetermined magnitude for moving the active member to a desired position. Actuation circuitry is provided for actuating the shape-memory alloy <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> by changing the temperature thereof only for the time necessary to move the active member to the desired position. The invention is particularly useful for changing the position of a camber-adjusting tab on a helicopter rotor blade by using two shape-memory alloy members that can act against each other to adjust dynamic properties of the rotor blade as it is rotating...|$|E
50|$|The saxhorn {{is based}} on the same three-valve system as most other valved brass instruments. Each member of the family is named after the root note {{produced}} by the second partial with no valves <b>actuated.</b> Each <b>member</b> nominally possesses or possessed the typical three-valve brass range from the note one tritone below that root note (second partial, all valves actuated) to the note produced by eighth partial with no valves actuated, i.e., the note two octaves above the root note.|$|R
40|$|Robots need {{to track}} objects. We {{identify}} {{two kinds of}} tracking problems in which: (i) the tracker is static or does not actuate on the tracked object and (ii) the tracker actuates on the object. This thesis focuses on the latter problem. Tracking is performed by a robot executing specific tasks acting over the object being tracked, such as a Segway RMP soccer robot grabbing and kicking a ball. Object tracking efficiency completely depends on {{the accuracy of the}} motion model and of the sensory information. The motion model of the target becomes particulary complex in our case and highly dependent on the robot’s actions. In addition, this thesis also considers the challenging environment of multiple team <b>members</b> <b>actuating</b> the object being tracked. In this case, the motion can become highly discontinuous and nonlinear. We assume that robots know their own actions, and robots in a team are collaborating according to the coordination plans. We claim that the knowledge in terms of the single robot control strategy and the multi-robot coordination plan can be a valuable source of information for tracking. Communication between robots is another interesting information source. This thesis contributes an approach to incorporate prior an...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{object of}} the present {{invention}} {{is to provide a}} simple, reliable, and lightweight coupling that will also have an efficient thermal interface. A further {{object of the}} invention is to provide a coupling that is capable of blind mating with little or no insertion forces. Another object of the invention is to provide a coupling that acts as a thermal regulator to maintain a constant temperature {{on one side of the}} coupling. Another object of the invention is to increase the available surface area of a coupling thus providing a larger area for the conduction of heat across the thermal interface. Another object of the invention is to provide a fluidic coupling that has no fluid passing across the interface, thus reducing the likelihood of leaks and contamination. The foregoing objects are achieved by utilizing, as in the prior art, a hot area (at an elevated temperature as compared to a cold area) with a need to remove excess heat from the hot area to a cold area. In this device, the thermal interface will occur not on a planar horizontal surface, but along a non-planar vertical surface, which will reduce the reaction forces and increase the thermal conductivity of the device. One non-planar surface is a surface on a cold pin extending from the cold area and the other non-planar surface is a surface on a hot pin extending from the hot area. The cold pin is fixed and does not move while the hot pin is a flexible member and its movement towards the cold pin will bring the two non-planar surfaces together forming the thermal interface. The <b>actuating</b> <b>member</b> for the device is a shape-memory actuation wire which is attached through an aperture to the hot pin and through another aperture to an actuation wire retainer. By properly programming the actuation wire, heat from the hot area will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot wire. Heat from the hot area will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot pin towards the cold pin forming the coupling and the desired thermal interface. The shape-memory actuation wire is made of a shape-memory-effect alloy such as Nitinol...|$|E
