25|$|After the war, having saved {{most of his}} wages, Kerkorian spent $5,000 on a Cessna. He {{worked as}} a general {{aviation}} pilot, and made {{his first visit to}} Las Vegas in 1944. After spending much time in LasVegas during the 1940s, Kerkorian quit gambling and in 1947 paid $60,000 for Trans International Airlines, which was a small <b>air-charter</b> service that flew gamblers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. He then bid on some war surplus bombers, using money on loan from the Seagram family. Gasoline, and especially airplane fuel, was in short supply at the time, so he sold the fuel from the planes' tanks, paid off his loan, and still had the airplanes. He operated the airline until 1968 when he sold it for $104million to the Transamerica Corporation.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{improved}} facilities, {{a number of}} businesses moved into the airport. Two <b>air-charter</b> operations were based at the field and a glider company operated from the field from Thanksgiving through Memorial Day. [...] The field was also the only field between Stuart and Fort Lauderdale to allow banner towing advertising business. The airport had functioned as a jump-off point for flights into the Caribbean, particularly The Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The increase of drug-trafficking curtailed Caribbean flights starting the mid-90s.|$|E

The Indian Aviation Industry has experienced a tremendous growth in the last few years, more so in the Private Aviation Sector. Keeping in mind emerging the market demand VRL decided to enter the <b>Air-charter</b> Industry and serve VVIPs, VIPs & Corporate India.|$|E

50|$|The airline had {{its roots}} as a {{regional}} <b>air-charter</b> company as Tradewinds Charters formed in 1975, serving leisure destinations using planes predominantly leased from parent airline Singapore Airlines. Scheduled services were introduced as Tradewinds Airlines on 21 February 1989, when it leased McDonnell Douglas MD-87 aeroplanes for services to 6 destinations: Pattaya, Phuket, Hat Yai and Kuantan from Singapore's Changi International Airport and Tioman from Singapore's Seletar Airport. As the carrier matured, regional business destinations such as Jakarta, Phnom Penh and Yangon were added to its network, thereby broadening the airline's appeal beyond the holiday-maker to include the business traveller.|$|E

50|$|Air Charter Services Pvt. Ltd. {{also known}} as ACSPL is an Indian company which {{provides}} <b>air-charter</b> service across the country. India has around 120 air charter companies, on year 2014 DGCA tried to force the companies to cancel their NSOP (Non-Schedule Operators Permit) due to the reason {{that most of the}} companies have less than three aircraft and would be treated as, 'private'. ACSPL has not been affected due to their fleet range of more than three aircraft and continue to run under current NSOP. The company is based in New Delhi, the capital city of the Republic of India. The company has been awarded the maiden BizAvIndia Awards on the sidelines of Aero India 2015 by the 'Business Aircraft Operators Association'(BAOA). The company has been listed as non-schedule operator with Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the body which functions under Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India. ACSPL suffered a loss of one of its aircraft crashed due to bad weather on year 2011, It was flying back to New-Delhi from Patna. ACSPL is also appointed as 'Pilatus' Authorized Sales and Service Centre for India.|$|E
40|$|Demand {{responsive}} {{transportation is}} a variable route service of passengers or freight from specific origin(s) to destination(s) {{in response to}} the request of users. Operational planning of DRT system encompasses the methods to provide efficient service to the passengers and to the system operators. These methods cover the assignments of vehicles to transportation requests and vehicle routings under various constraints such as environmental conditions, traffic and service limitations. Advances in the information and communication technologies, such as the Internet, mobile communication devices, GIS, GPS, Intelligent Transportation Systems have led to a significantly complex and highly dynamical decision making environment. Recent approaches to DRT operational planning are based on 2 ̆ 2 closed information loop 2 ̆ 2 to achieve a higher level of automation, increased flexibility and efficiency. Intelligent and effective use of the available information in such a complex decision making environment requires the application of formal modeling and control approaches, which are robust, modular and computationally efficient. In this study, DRT systems are modeled as Discrete Event Systems using Finite Automata formalism and DRT real time control is addressed using Supervisory Control Theory. Two application scenarios are considered; the first is based on <b>air-charter</b> service and illustrates uncontrolled system model and operational specification synthesis. The automatic synthesis of centralized and modular supervisors is demonstrated. The second scenario is a mission critical application based on emergency evacuation problem. Decentralized supervisory control architecture suitable for accommodating the real-time contingencies is presented. Conditions for parallel computation of local supervisors are specified and the computational advantages of alternative supervisory control architectures are discussed. Discrete event system modeling and supervisory control theory are well established and powerful mathematical tools. In this dissertation, they are shown to be suitable for expressing the modeling and control requirements of complex and dynamic applications in DRT. The modeling and control approaches described herein, coupled with the mature body of research literature in Discrete Event Systems and Supervisory Control Theory, facilitate logical analysis of these complex systems and provide the necessary framework for development of intelligent decision making tools for real time operational planning and control in a broad range of DRT applications...|$|E
