5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of <b>a</b> <b>caring</b> and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was <b>a</b> <b>caring</b> parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E

He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, <b>a</b> <b>caring</b> monarch, and the source of national unity and well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. The disputes were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E

5|$|Vijay {{began the}} new {{millennium}} with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamanavale. The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. While Friends was commercially successful, the other two underperformed. His subsequent films that were released for the next year-and-a-half did not do well at the box office. The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player opposite Trisha in Dharani's Ghilli (2004), which {{went on to become}} the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year. It was also the first Tamil film to earn 500million (Indian rupees). His performance as <b>a</b> <b>caring</b> brother in the masala film Thirupachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007). The latter garnered him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor. Barring Vettaikaaran (2009), all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Thamizh Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career, to his 50th film, Sura (2010), were commercial failures.|$|E

40|$|Background: Most Thai people {{reject the}} idea of letting their ageing parents live in <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home due {{to the belief that}} <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home is <b>a</b> place for poor older adults who have no family. These beliefs could {{influence}} the perception of living in <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home among older residents and result in low self-esteem, isolation, self-harm and depression. Therefore, this study explored the factors associated with depressive symptoms and other variables among older adults residing in <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home in Thailand. Method/Design: 128 older residents were recruited from two care homes in the northeast of Thailand and data was collected using the 15 -Item Thai Geriatric Depression Scale, Internalised Stigma of Living in <b>a</b> <b>Care</b> Home Scale, Thai Version of Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Thai Version of Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and a Coping Strategies Inventory Short Form. Results: Depressive symptoms were found to be significantly correlated with internalised stigma, self-esteem and social support (r= 0. 563, - 0. 574 and - 0. 333) (p< 0. 001), respectively. Perceived internalised stigma of living in <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home is the strongest predictor of reporting experiencing some level of depressive symptoms, resulting in an odds ratio of 9. 165. Discussion: Perceived internalised stigma is significantly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and is the strongest predictor of the risk of depressive symptoms. By understanding and improving the knowledge of internalised stigma of living in <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home could inform strategy, intervention and guidelines for appropriate care for older adults residing in <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home...|$|R

5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed <b>a</b> <b>caring</b> relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study, aims to i) {{explore the}} process of ‘moving into <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home’ {{from the perspectives of}} relatives/family carers and ii) identify the needs of relatives/family carers throughout {{the process of}} ‘moving to <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home’. With Britain’s ageing population, {{people are more likely to}} need to move into <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home. The move can lead to psychological distress as well as poor integration of the older person and their families into the care home environment. Recent policy has focussed on avoiding admission to <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home where possible, rather than meeting the needs of people for whom it is the only option. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews involving seven participants that had previously assisted a relative to move into <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home. Analysis revealed three themes relating to the process: ‘recognising the need’, ‘the decision-making process’ and ‘adapting caregivers’ roles’, and two themes relating to relatives/family carers needs: ‘support and information’ and ‘involvement in residents care’. The findings show that the process was smoother for relatives/family carers when there was early recognition of the need for <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home, and when families were involved in decision-making, however decisions were often found to be expert-driven. Support was noted as a key need for relatives/family carers, yet it was evident that healthcare professional’s (HCPs) need more training to provide appropriate support effectively. The study showed that the process of moving into <b>a</b> <b>care</b> home has <b>a</b> negative public image and until this is alleviated relatives/family carers will continue to resist the process...|$|R

25|$|Primary anorgasmia is a {{condition}} where one has never experienced an orgasm. This is significantly more common in women, although it can occur in men who lack the gladipudendal (bulbocavernosus) reflex. Women with this condition can sometimes achieve a relatively low level of sexual excitement. Frustration, restlessness, and pelvic pain or a heavy pelvic sensation may occur because of vascular engorgement. On occasion, {{there may be no}} obvious reason why orgasm is unobtainable. In such cases, women report that they are unable to orgasm even if they have <b>a</b> <b>caring,</b> skilled partner, adequate time and privacy, and an absence of medical issues which would affect sexual satisfaction.|$|E

Yet he is also said to have been very generous with all his friends and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature {{to the fact that he}} was abandoned by his father, an Oakland police officer and overly coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and was something he secretly feared. During his entire life Russ Meyer spoke with only the highest reverence for his mother and sister.|$|E

At Oxford he had an active pastoral life as an Anglican priest, though nothing of it appears in the Apologia. Later he was active as a Catholic priest. His parishioners at the Oratory, apart from a few professional men and their families, were mainly factory workers, Irish immigrants, and tradespeople. He was <b>a</b> <b>caring</b> pastor, and their recorded reminiscences show that they held him in affection.|$|E
