5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting {{that it could have been}} the explosion of an <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the night}} of 2/3 April 1946, there were several attacks on railway {{installations}} around the country. One at Yibna occurred {{at the same time}} as a patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion was entering the village. The patrol's leading two vehicles exploded mines that had been laid on a bridge, wounding three men. At daylight the tracks of around 30 men were found, and a section from the 8th Parachute Battalion eventually cornered 24 armed men. In the firefight that followed, 14 of them were wounded and the remainder surrendered, with no British casualties. On 29 June Operation Agatha started; the brigade had been rotated to cover the south of Palestine, and were to search for arms and arrest any members of the Palmach in Givat Brenner and No'ar Oved. On 22 July the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed, which was the catalyst for Operation Shark, the searching of every house and property in Tel Aviv. For this operation the brigade had all the divisional artillery and the 3rd The King's Own Hussars under their command. The brigade's next tasks were Operations Bream and Eel between 28 August and 4 September, which entailed the search of Dorot and Ruhama in the Negev. For the first time army dogs trained in metal detecting were used during the operations, and they located a large <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> in both settlements.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, police {{discovered}} a stay-behind <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> {{in an old}} mine close to Windisch-Bleiberg and forced the British authorities to hand over a list with the location of 33 other caches in Austria.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{the police}} {{discovered}} an <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> and radio equipment at a mountain cabin and arrested Hans Otto Meyer, a businessman {{accused of being}} involved in selling illegal alcohol. Meyer claimed that the weapons were supplied by Norwegian intelligence. Rolf Hansen, defence minister at that time, stated the network was not in any way answerable to NATO and had no CIA connection.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the IRA relied {{mostly on}} {{weaponry}} smuggled from Libya. The regular shipments from the United States, once {{the main source}} of arms for the republicans through the gunrunning operations of George Harrison, were disrupted after he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1981. The smuggling scheme suffered a further blow when the Fenit-based trawler Marita Ann, with a huge <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> from Boston, was captured by the Irish Naval Service in 1985.|$|E

2500|$|If Gladio was {{effectively}} [...] "the best-kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II", {{it must be}} underlined, however, that on several occasions, <b>arms</b> <b>caches</b> were discovered and stay-behind paramilitary organizations officially dissolved.|$|R

25|$|Already in 1990, it {{was known}} that the weapons cache near Velp, while accidentally 'discovered' in 1983, had been plundered {{partially}} before. It still contained dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives {{at the time of}} discovery, but five hand grenades had gone missing. A Dutch investigative television program revealed on 9 September 2007, that another <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> that had belonged to Gladio had been ransacked in the 1980s. It was located in a park near Scheveningen. Some of the stolen weapons, including hand grenades and machine guns, later turned up when police officials arrested criminals John Mieremet and Sam Klepper in 1991. The Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD feared at the time that disclosure of the Gladio history of these weapons would have been politically sensitive.|$|E
500|$|In January 1981, Mugabe demoted Nkomo in {{a cabinet}} reshuffle; the latter warned {{that this would}} anger ZAPU supporters. In February, {{violence}} between ZAPU and ZANU-PF supporters broke out among the battalion stationed at Ntabazindune, soon spreading to other army bases, resulting in 300 deaths. An <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> featuring land mines and anti-aircraft missiles were then discovered at Ascot Farm, which was part-owned by Nkomo. Mugabe cited this as evidence that ZAPU were plotting a coup, an allegation that Nkomo denied. Likening Nkomo to [...] "a cobra in the house", Mugabe sacked him from the government, and ZAPU-owned businesses, farms, and properties were seized.|$|E

500|$|A large Real IRA {{explosives}} dump and <b>arms</b> <b>cache</b> {{were discovered}} in Dunleer, County Louth by Gardaí in October 2010, following a weekend of searches and arrests in {{the east of the}} country. In addition, two Real IRA men were charged in Dublin's non-jury Special Criminal Court of membership of an illegal organisation. The Real IRA claimed responsibility for kidnapping and shooting dead of one of their members, Kieran Doherty, for alleged drug dealing. Further significant seizures of Real IRA arms and explosives were made by the Gardaí during 2012 and 2013, leading to the arrest of over a dozen persons. In 2011 Michael Campbell, brother of Liam, was found guilty in Vilnius, Lithuania, of trying to purchase arms and explosives and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In October 2013 Campbell was freed on appeal, only to have the Supreme Court of Lithuania order a retrial in June 2014. Campbell has maintained his innocence, accusing British intelligence of attempting to frame him. In June 2013 Gardaí arrested eight people after a Real IRA meeting and uncovered a massive haul of the plastic explosive Semtex in two raids in Dublin. In October 2013 the Real IRA claimed responsibility for [...] "executing" [...] an alleged leading cocaine dealer in north Belfast.|$|E

Realising that Adair's time was up, Courtney prepared to defect by visiting the mother of Johnny Adair's wife Gina Crossan and threatening her unless she told him the whereabouts of Adair's <b>arms</b> <b>cache.</b> Although Adair's mother-in-law was unable to give him the information he sought, Courtney was able to take weapons and money from a nearby C Company arms dump. He subsequently took these to the [...] "Heather Social Club", the headquarters of those on the Shankill loyal to the mainstream UDA, where he affirmed his split from Adair and his new loyalty to McDonald. Courtney denounced Adair as a [...] "treacherous bastard" [...] for the attempted hit against him. Adair's supporters fled the Shankill a few days later (with Adair himself back in prison), and in a public show of loyalty to the new UDA regime, Courtney was filmed by television cameras defacing a mural Adair had ordered painted extolling the friendship between the UDA and the Loyalist Volunteer Force. This was part of a wider removal of murals, posters and graffiti in support of Adair and C Company.|$|E
