5|$|On 25 April 1940, Kommandøren steamed in the Sognefjord, {{carrying}} regular passengers, {{as well as}} a load {{of around}} 100 soldiers bound for Gudvangen and Voss for service with the Norwegian Army's 4th Division. The soldiers brought in that day belonged to an older age group not called up in the initial mobilization drive. While en route from Vik to Balestrand, the steamer was bombed and strafed by a German bomber. The bombs did not hit the ship, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> gun bullets only did minor damage and caused no casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Mark 1 was {{to provide}} a {{computing}} resource within the university, to allow researchers to gain experience in the practical use of computers, but it very quickly also became a prototype on which the design of Ferranti's commercial version could be based. Development ceased at the end of 1949, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> was scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced in February 1951 by a Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.|$|E

5|$|The UK Album Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most {{downloaded}} albums in the United Kingdom. During the 2000s, the chart was {{compiled by the}} Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf on the British music industry, and was based solely on Sunday-to-Saturday sales of non-subscription music downloads from selected online stores. The most successful artist of the decade was the British band Snow Patrol, who spent eight weeks at number one with their albums Eyes Open and A Hundred Million Suns. The record label that spent the most weeks at number one was Island Records – with an artist roster that included Florence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Machine,</b> Amy Winehouse and Keane, Island spent 22 weeks at number one with nine different albums.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the 2015 festival Foo Fighters {{frontman}} Dave Grohl fell off a stage during a show in Gothenburg and broke his leg, forcing their late withdrawal from the line-up. Florence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> were moved from second-top on the bill to Friday's headliner, while Florence's vacant gap was filled by Reading & Leeds headliners The Libertines, and their performance was well received. Kanye West and The Who were the headliners for the Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Other notable acts who performed included Motörhead (their final festival appearance in the UK before Lemmy's death), Pharrell Williams, Deadmau5, Patti Smith, the Strypes, Lionel Richie, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Enter Shikari, the Chemical Brothers, Thee Faction, Alt-J, Paloma Faith, Mary J. Blige and Paul Weller, as well as an appearance by the 14th Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E

In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hip hop and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> is activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday.

In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> could reach a slightly higher ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) the maximum speed was 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E
5|$|With Jivevaneng decided, the Australians turned {{advancing}} west towards Sattelberg. The {{force that}} {{was chosen for}} this was the recently arrived 26th Brigade, which would be supported by nine Matildas of the 1st Tank Battalion. At the same time, the 4th Brigade, a Militia formation detached from the 5th Division, was brought up to relieve the 26th Brigade of garrison duties around Finschhafen. The tanks moved up to Jivevaneng {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage to drown out their noise {{in an effort to keep}} their presence secret until the start of the advance. On 16 November, the 2/48th Infantry Battalion, supported by the artillery of the 2/12th Field Regiment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> guns of the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, captured Green Ridge overlooking the track, which was the designated forming-up point for the advance on Sattelberg, which began the following day.|$|E
