60|$|It may {{be argued}} that war compels socialization, that after the war the world will perforce return to materialistic individualism.

Confidence that such <b>an</b> <b>order,</b> thanks to the advancement of science, is now within our grasp should not be difficult for Americans, once they have rightly conceived it. We, who have always pinned our faith to ideas, who entered the conflict for an Idea, must be the last to shirk the task, however Herculean, of world reconstruction along the lines of our own professed faith. We cannot be renegades to Democracy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an attempt to}} formalize Hayek's notion of spontaneous order {{within the framework of}} the Arrow-Debreu economy. Our study shows that if a competitive economy is enough fair and free, then <b>a</b> spontaneous economic <b>order</b> <b>shall</b> emerge in long-run competitive equilibria so that social members together occupy an optimal distribution of income. Despite this, the spontaneous order might degenerate in the form of economic crises whenever an equilibrium economy approaches the extreme competition. Remarkably, such a theoretical framework of spontaneous <b>order</b> provides <b>a</b> bridge linking Austrian economics and Neoclassical economics, where we shall comprehend a truth: "Freedom promotes technological progress".
