40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{differential}} graded operad of A_infinity-algebras is <b>a</b> cofibrant <b>replacement</b> (<b>a</b> dg-resolution) of the operad of associative differential graded algebras without units. In this article we find <b>a</b> cofibrant <b>replacement</b> of the operad of associative differential graded algebras with units. Algebras over it are called homotopy unital A_infinity-algebras. We prove that the operad bimodule of A_infinity-morphisms is <b>a</b> cofibrant <b>replacement</b> of the operad bimodule of morphisms of dg-algebras without units. Similarly we show that the operad bimodule of homotopy unital A_infinity-morphisms is <b>a</b> cofibrant <b>replacement</b> of the operad bimodule of morphisms of dg-algebras with units.
