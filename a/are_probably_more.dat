5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, {{the common}} {{starling}} {{was introduced in}} 1897 by Cecil Rhodes. It spread slowly and by 1954 had reached Clanwilliam and Port Elizabeth. It is now common in the southern Cape region, thinning out northwards to the Johannesburg area. It {{is present in the}} Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Free State provinces of South Africa and lowland Lesotho, with occasional sightings in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and around the town of Oranjemund in Namibia. In Southern Africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is very much associated with man, his habitations and pastures. It favours irrigated land and is absent from regions where the ground is baked so dry that it cannot probe for insects. It may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than they are by inter-specific competition. It breeds from September to December and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks, often roosting in reedbeds. It is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E

25|$|Dysentery and {{diarrhea}} result directly from famine, typically through consumption of poor-quality food or {{deterioration of the}} digestive system caused by malnutrition. Cholera is a waterborne disease associated with poor sanitation and contaminated water or food; it is often considered a disease brought on more by social disruption than malnutrition. Cholera arose from different sources near {{the onset of the}} faminecarried by escapees from Burma and erupting {{in the wake of the}} October cyclone and flooding. Smallpox was an airborne disease often associated with crowded living arrangements. Statistics for smallpox and cholera <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> reliable than those for malaria, since their symptoms are more easily recognisable.|$|E
25|$|Other safety {{concerns}} about vaccines {{have been published}} on the Internet, in informal meetings, in books, and at symposia. These include hypotheses that vaccination can cause sudden infant death syndrome, epileptic seizures, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, as well as hypotheses that vaccinations can transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. These hypotheses have been investigated, with the conclusion that currently used vaccines meet high safety standards and that criticism of vaccine safety in the popular press is not justified. Large well-controlled epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} and the results do not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause chronic diseases. Furthermore, some vaccines <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> likely to prevent or modify than cause or exacerbate autoimmune diseases.|$|E
500|$|Since {{all modern}} ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common {{ancestor}} also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped {{body and a}} pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event [...] while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain. A clade including Mertensia, Charistephane and Euplokamis may be the sister lineage to all other ctenophores.|$|E

2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological. [...] "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that {{this is also a}} socially oriented state of mind that is socially produced and managed." [...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'.

2500|$|After {{peace was}} {{established}} between the Triumvirate and {{the followers of}} Sextus Pompeius, a general amnesty was announced, and Livia returned to Rome, where she was personally introduced to Octavian in 39 BC. At this time, Livia already had a son, the future emperor Tiberius, and was pregnant with the second, Nero Claudius Drusus (also known as Drusus the Elder). Legend said that Octavian fell immediately in love with her, {{despite the fact that}} he was still married to Scribonia. Octavian divorced Scribonia in 39 BC, on the very day that she gave birth to his daughter Julia the Elder. Seemingly around that time, when Livia was six months pregnant, Tiberius Claudius Nero was persuaded or forced by Octavian to divorce Livia. On 14 January, the child was born. [...] Augustus and Livia married on 17 January, waiving the traditional waiting period. Tiberius Claudius Nero was present at the wedding, giving her in marriage [...] "just as a father would." [...] The importance of the patrician Claudii to Octavian's cause, and the political survival of the Claudii Nerones <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> rational explanations for the tempestuous union. Nevertheless, Livia and Augustus remained married for the next 51 years, despite the fact that they had no children apart from a single miscarriage. She always enjoyed the status of privileged counselor to her husband, petitioning him on the behalf of others and influencing his policies, an unusual role for a Roman wife in a culture dominated by the pater familias.|$|E
