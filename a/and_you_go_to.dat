6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Mr. Monk, and {{how they}} left Miss Fregelius behind, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> fetch her, <b>and</b> all sorts of strange things {{happened}} to you. We think it quite wonderful and romantic. I am writing to dear Miss Porson {{to tell her about}} it, because I am sure that you are too modest to sing your own praises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every minute {{until the}} snow comes, and we usually begin hauling grain {{in to the}} {{railroad}} on the bob-sledges then. In summer it's work from sun-up until it's dark, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep in ten minutes after you come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't any show down here," [...] was the skipper's complaint. [...] "The {{government}} protects {{a nigger}} against a white every time. You can't shoot first. You've {{got to give}} the nigger first shot, or else the government calls it murder <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Fiji. That's why there's so many drowning accidents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] laughed Vane. [...] "In fact, cookery {{is one of}} the bushman's trials; anyway, when he's {{working for}} himself. You come back dead tired, and often very wet, to your lonely tent, and then there's a fire to make and supper to get before you can rest. It happens now and then that you're too played out to trouble, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep instead." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A little. It's my one dissipation; and it's {{rather an}} {{expensive}} one.

Our paths diverge from this moment. I go to the summer-house, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Hall, where my father is expecting you."

"Then I {{thought you}} prayed for me--and I could see <b>you</b> <b>and</b> hear every word <b>you</b> said. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed, <b>and</b> I was so sorry that I took and wrote {{on a piece}} of {{sycamore}} bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being pirates,' {{and put it on the}} table by the candle; <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over <b>and</b> kissed <b>you</b> on the lips." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{must see}} for yourselves {{that it will}} be {{difficult}} to follow our adventures unless you are familiar with the Kensington Gardens, as they now became known to David.

The reason it is soon time to turn back is that you sleep from twelve to one. If your mother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one, you could most likely see the whole of them.|$|E
60|$|Steve {{has just}} {{finished}} dinner, in his comfortable lodgings. He is not even in evening dress, but he does wear a lounge jacket, which we devoutly hope will give him a rakish air to Amy's eyes. He would undoubtedly have put on evening dress if he had known she was coming. His man, Richardson, is waiting on him. When we wrote that we deliberated a long time. It has an air, and with a little low cunning we could make you think {{to the very end}} that Richardson was a male. But if the play is acted <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see it, you would be disappointed. Steve, the wretched fellow, never had a Man, and Richardson is only his landlady's slavey, aged about fifteen, and wistful at sight of food. We introduce her gazing at Steve's platter {{as if it were a}} fairy tale. Steve has often caught her with this rapt expression on her face, and sometimes, as now, an engaging game ensues.|$|E
6000|$|There was but one way for it. [...] "Sir," [...] said I, {{addressing}} Holkar, [...] "go out to-night <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> certain death. Loll Mahommed has {{not seen}} the fort as I have. Pass the gate if you please, and for what? to fall before the fire of a hundred pieces of artillery; to storm another gate, and then another, and then to be blown up, with Gahagan's garrison in the citadel. Who talks of courage? Were I not in your august presence, O star of the faithful, I would crop Loll Mahommed's nose from his face, and wear his ears as an ornament in my own pugree! Who is there here that knows not the difference between yonder yellow-skinned coward and Gahagan Khan Guj--I mean Bobbachy Bahawder? I am ready to fight one, two, three, or twenty of them, at broad-sword, small-sword, single-stick, with fists if you please. By the holy piper, fighting is like mate and dthrink to Ga--to Bobbachy, I mane--whoop! come on, you divvle, and I'll bate the skin off your ugly bones." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Must we {{part in this}} way, St. John? <b>And</b> when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> India, will <b>you</b> {{leave me}} so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} do?" [...] he said. [...] "You surely forget the reward. Tell us {{where are your}} goods, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>to</b> your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is nice--but {{you don't}} know the life. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> would {{be alone with}} people like animals. <b>And</b> if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Italy he will beat you--he will beat you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{are now in}} need of some ready money; {{and what}} I propose is, that you shall go to work, [...] "tooth and nail," [...] for {{somebody}} who will give you money for it. Let father and your boys take charge of things at home--prepare for a crop, and make the crop; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work for the best money wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get. And to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of next May, get for your own labor either in money or in your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. In this, I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines, in California, but I mean {{for you to go}} at it for the best wages you can get close to home, in Coles County. Now if you will do this, you will soon be out of debt, and what is better, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again. But if I should now clear you out, next year you will be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in Heaven for $70 or $80. Then you value your place in Heaven very cheaply, for I am sure you can with the offer I make you get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work. You say if I furnish you the money you will deed me the land, and if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession--Nonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then live without it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not now mean to be unkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will find it worth more than eight times eighty dollars to you.|$|E

5000|$|Ashanti {{commented on}} the video: [...] "It's being {{played out in the}} video, {{basically}} just describing how when a man cheats on a woman how it feels like a woman is scorned <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> drastic measures, just to show the passion and the drama when it comes to being hurt, y'know, whether you're male or female." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I told {{my father}} about him,--how <b>you</b> rescued him, <b>and</b> how <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{see him in the}} hospital, and what a good man he is, and how poor." ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{faculty member}} {{listening}} to it recalled telling another that it was [...] "the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner." [...] A friend of Foster's has said, [...] "Look, it's just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time.

5000|$|Hurwitz {{noted the}} tension in the song between the {{aspirations}} of the singers and the uncertain outcome of their efforts, noting [...] "It’s an optimistic song, but it’s also about unfulfilled dreams." [...] Paul said, [...] "You pursue that dream, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed and get up the next day, and it’s a gorgeous day. It encourages you in one breath, and in another breath doesn’t acknowledge that you just failed miserably. You wake up and it doesn’t match your mood. It’s a bright and shiny day." ...|$|E
