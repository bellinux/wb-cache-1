40|$|The {{investigated}} food packings {{consist of}} an outer layer of cardboard, a laminate adhesive and biodegradable plastics as the inner layer. Polyvinyl alcohol (Mowiol, Polyviol), polyhydroxy butyrate (Biopol), cellulose <b>acetate</b> (<b>Flake</b> type, Dexel type), cellulose nitrate, cell glass and polycaprolactone (Tone Polymer) as the plastic component {{as well as}} SiO_x as additional coating have been considered and tested {{on the basis of}} national standards and the EU 'draft synoptic document 5 on plastics materials and articles intended to come into contact with food stuffs'. The results of the conducted investigations, including sensoric evaluations after long-term storage, demonstrated that the prototype packings for dried food developed in the frame of this project are of almost equal value as current original food packings.
