5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} with myself, that affection may not press upon judgment; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E

Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E

[...] For the [...] "Cheek to Cheek" [...] routine, {{she was determined to}} use her own creation: [...] "I was determined to wear this dress, come hell or high water. <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> It moved beautifully. Obviously, no one in the cast or crew was willing to take sides, particularly not my side. This was all right with me. I'd had to stand alone before.

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it. <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} use of Auto-Tune in Spears' voice. Ewing said that Blackout serves as a {{reminder}} of how instantly recognizable Spears' vocals are, saying that [...] "treated or untreated: her thin Southern huskiness is one of the defining sounds of 00s pop." [...] He noted that the album [...] "is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument, disrupting and jamming the songs as much as it helps them." [...] While reviewing Spears' demo of [...] "Telephone", Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone compared it to [...] "Piece of Me", [...] "proving yet again how much impact Britney has had on the sonics of current pop. People love to make fun of Britney, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>not,</b> but if 'Telephone' proves anything, it's that Blackout may be the most influential pop album of the past five years." [...] In June 2012, [...] "Blackout" [...] was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's musical library and archive.|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard looking the other way and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> you just do a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The terms inoculation, {{vaccination}} and immunization {{are often}} used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries. However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine, inoculation referred only {{to the practice of}} variolation until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798, this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation continued to be referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g. diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc., and the question e.g. [...] "Have you had your flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization?" [...] should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given <b>and</b> <b>why,</b> <b>not</b> the literal meaning of the technique used.|$|E
