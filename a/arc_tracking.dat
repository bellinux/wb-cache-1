2500|$|In 2014, the South African investigative {{journalist}} Mark D. Young presented {{a theory that}} a short circuit in the onboard electronics may have caused the fire. The so-called wet <b>arc</b> <b>tracking</b> arises from the action of moisture when the insulation of live wires is damaged. A leakage current to another damaged wire with the respective potential difference may form. The resulting flashover may reach temperatures of up to [...] This temperature is sufficient to ignite the thermal-acoustic insulation blankets that were still used until the late 1990s. Such a short circuit caused the fire on board Swissair Flight 111, resulting in {{the crash of the}} aircraft in 1998.|$|E

40|$|Kapton {{polyimide}} wiring insulation {{was found}} to be vulnerable to pyrolization, <b>arc</b> <b>tracking,</b> and flashover when momentary short-circuit arcs have occurred on aircraft power systems. Short-circuit arcs between wire pairs can pyrolize the polyimide resulting in a conductive char between conductors that may sustain the arc (<b>arc</b> <b>tracking).</b> Furthermore, the <b>arc</b> <b>tracking</b> may spread (flashover) to other wire pairs within a wire bundle. Polyimide Kapton will also be used as the insulating material for the flexible current carrier (FCC) of Space Station Freedom (SSF). The FCC, with conductors in a planar type geometric layout as opposed to bundles, is known to sustain <b>arc</b> <b>tracking</b> at proposed SSF power levels. Tests were conducted in a vacuum bell jar that was designed to conduct polyimide pyrolysis, <b>arc</b> <b>tracking,</b> and flashover studies on samples of SSF's FCC. Test results will be reported concerning the minimal power level needed to sustain <b>arc</b> <b>tracking</b> and the FCC susceptibility to flashover.

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} investigated whether unipolar arcing in the divertor of fusion reactors is {{a potential}} cause for enhanced wear of the divertor. It was found that 1 &#xa 0;μm of nano-fuzz growth is sufficient to initiate arcing, mainly depending on the sheath potential drop and electron density. The average mass loss rate induced by the arc was determined from mass loss measurements and found {{to be consistent with}} the value estimated from the arc current. The average <b>arc</b> <b>track</b> erosion depth was estimated by using the measured mass loss and damaged surface area and was found to be one tenth of the fuzzy layer thickness. Due to melting of the fuzzy structures the actual depth is larger and some <b>arc</b> <b>tracks</b> occasionally appeared to even reach the bulk beyond the fuzzy layer. The conclusion of this study is therefore that arcing in the divertor of future tokamaks (e. g. ITER) potentially is an important cause for surface damage and plasma pollution...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of <b>arc</b> <b>track</b> testing conducted to determine if such a transfer of power to un-energized wires is possible and/or likely during an arcing event, and to evaluate an array of protection schemes that may significantly reduce the possibility of such a transfer. The results of these experiments may be useful for determining the level of protection necessary to guard against spurious voltage and current being applied to safety critical circuits. It was not the purpose of these experiments to determine the probability of the initiation of an <b>arc</b> <b>track</b> event only if an initiation did occur could it cause the undesired event: an inadvertent thruster firing. The primary wire insulation used in the Orbiter is aromatic polyimide, or Kapton, a construction known to <b>arc</b> <b>track</b> under certain conditions [3]. Previous Boeing testing has shown that <b>arc</b> <b>tracks</b> can initiate in aromatic polyimide insulated 28 volts direct current (VDC) power circuits using more realistic techniques such as chafing with an aluminum blade (simulating the corner of an avionics box or lip of a wire tray), or vibration of an aluminum plate against a wire bundle [4]. Therefore, an arc initiation technique was chosen that provided a reliable and consistent technique of starting the arc and not a realistic simulation of a scenario on the vehicle. Once an arc is initiated, the current, power and propagation characteristics of the arc depend on the power source, wire gauge and insulation type, circuit protection and series resistance rather than type of initiation. The initiation method employed for these tests was applying an oil and graphite mixture to the ends of a powered twisted pair wire. The flight configuration of the heater circuits, the fuel/oxider (or ox) wire, and the RCS jet solenoid were modeled in the test configuration so that the behavior of these components during an arcing event could be studied. To determine if coil activation would occur with various protection wire schemes, 145 tests were conducted using various fuel/ox wire alternatives (shielded and unshielded) and/or different combinations of polytetrafuloroethylene (PTFE), Mystik tape and convoluted wraps to prevent unwanted coil activation. Test results were evaluated along with other pertinent data and information to develop a mitigation strategy for an inadvertent RCS firing. The SSP evaluated civilian aircraft wiring failures to search for aging trends in assessing the wire-short hazard.

40|$|Wiring system {{failures}} {{have resulted from}} arc propagation in the wiring harnesses of current aerospace vehicles. These failures occur when the insulation becomes conductive upon the initiation of an arc. In some cases, the conductive path of the carbon <b>arc</b> <b>track</b> displays a high enough resistance such that the current is limited, and therefore {{may be difficult to}} detect using conventional circuit protection. Often, such wiring failures are not simply the result of insulation failure, but are due to a combination of wiring system factors. Inadequate circuit protection, unforgiving system designs, and careless maintenance procedures can contribute to a wiring system failure. This paper approaches the problem with respect to the overall wiring system, in order to determine what steps can be taken to improve the reliability, maintainability, and safety of space power systems.

40|$|This {{report shows}} the {{existence}} of a parametric family of isochronous arcs and analytical procedures to design them. Simple interactive programming tools have been developed to implement these procedures which speed up the search of near optimized isochronous arcs. The first-order anisochronicity is fully eliminated and the low values of the dispersion contribute to the second-order effects as well as to limiting the horizontal emittance growth. On the other hand, this makes the correction of the chromaticity with sextupoles more difficult because they cannot be placed where the dispersion is sufficiently high. This, however, becomes a severe problem when the arc is part of a ring through which the beam passes several times. Further investigations will be aimed at limiting these effects and studying the energy spread acceptance of such <b>arcs.</b> <b>Tracking</b> should provide results on the behaviour of this family of isochronous arcs at higher orders.

Abstract: {{numerical control}} system {{is used to}} control the gear hob and gear blank in autorotation and linkage generative movement, to realize the machining of teeth shape and teeth dividing; {{and at the same}} time it controls the vertical displacement of the gear hob and the horizontal displacement of gear blank, to make a circular <b>arc</b> <b>track</b> whose radius is the sum of gear blank’s radius and gear hob’s radius, thus realizing the NC machining of circular-arc aligned gear.

The advantage of this machining method lies in that when the hob cuts deeper, as the both side-blades are cutting the work-piece at the same time, the thinning on both sides are quite symmetrical, and the fine symmetry remains during the uniform change of the teeth thickness.
