60|$|Students {{of nature}} are {{familiar}} with the modifying effects of new conditions on man and brute. Take, for example, the gaucho: he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils. These conditions have made him differ widely from the peasant of the Peninsula; he has the endurance and keen sight of a wolf, is fertile in expedients, quick in <b>action,</b> <b>values</b> human life not at all, and is in pain or defeat a Stoic. Unquestionably the horse he rides has also suffered a great change. He differs as much from the English hunter, for instance, as one animal can well differ from another of the same species. He never pounds the earth and wastes his energies in vain parade. He has not the dauntless courage that performs such brilliant feats in the field, and that often as not attempts the impossible. In the chase he husbands all his strength, carrying his head low, and almost grazing the ground with his hoofs, so that he is not a showy animal. Constant use, or the slow cumulative process of natural selection, has served to develop a keenness of sense almost preternatural. The vulture's eye, with all the advantage derived from the vulture's vast elevation above the scene surveyed, is not so far-reaching as the sense of smell in the pampa horse. A common phenomenon on the pampas is a sudden migration of the horses of a district to some distant place. This occurs in seasons of drought, when grass or water fails. The horses migrate to some district where, from showers having fallen or other circumstances, there is a better supply of food and drink. A slight breeze blowing from the more favoured region, which may be forty or fifty miles away, or even much further, is enough to start them off. Yet, during the scorching days of midsummer, very little moisture or smell of grass can possibly reach them from such a distance.|$|E

The final <b>value</b> is the <b>Action</b> Result which is then compared to the difficulty of the task being performed. If the Action Result is {{greater than or equal to}} the difficulty, that action succeeds.

If the {{discount factor}} meets or exceeds 1, the <b>action</b> <b>values</b> may diverge. For , without a terminal state, or if the agent never reaches one, all environment histories will be infinitely long, and utilities with additive, undiscounted rewards will generally be infinite. Even with a discount factor only slightly lower than 1, the Q-function learning leads to propagation of errors and instabilities when the value function is approximated with an artificial neural network. In that case, {{it is known that}} starting with a lower discount factor and increasing it towards its final value yields accelerated learning.|$|E

For workplace noise regulation, the [...] "safe" [...] daily exposure amount at 85 dB A, known as an exposure action value, is 8 hours, while the [...] "safe" [...] exposure at 91 dB(A) is only 2 hours. Different standards use exposure <b>action</b> <b>values</b> between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85 dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a synergistic interaction. Since noise damage is cumulative {{over long periods of}} time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.|$|E

Second, the MFC is important when an exploratory action is generated in order to obtain more information about <b>action</b> <b>values</b> and the environment.

This paper presents a method of modu-lar learning which coordinates multiple behaviors tak-ing account of a trade-off between learning time and performance. First, {{in order to reduce the}} learning time the whole state space is classified into two cate-gories based on the <b>action</b> <b>values</b> separately obtained by Q learning: the area where one of the learned behav-iors is directly applicable (no more learning area), and the area where learning is necessary due to the com-petition {{of multiple}} behaviors (re-learning area).

Moreover, the knowledge of wind turbine characteristics or wind speed measurement is not required in the proposed method.
