5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, in Chicago's {{municipal}} elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as <b>alderman,</b> was the Solidarity Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor.

Evans replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from the spacious Finance Committee staff offices, Burke never used the relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead worked out of his private law office two blocks away. In the days {{following the death of}} Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of <b>Alderman</b> Eugene Sawyer over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the <b>alderman</b> who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in {{the spring of}} 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E
