5|$|The Finnish Red Guards {{seized the}} early {{initiative}} in the war, {{taking control of}} Helsinki on 28 January, and with a general <b>attack</b> <b>phase</b> lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial momentum, {{and most of the}} offensives came to nothing. The military order chain functioned relatively well at Red company and platoon level, but leadership and authority were weak, as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troopers. The common troopers were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.|$|E

500|$|After combat {{has been}} resolved, the player must move and {{assemble}} their forces in continental Europe, {{which is known}} as the movement phase. Two special units are exclusively available to the Warsaw Pact: [...] "the 1st Airborne Army which can be flown directly behind enemy lines, and the 1st Amphibious Army which can move over the sea to a tactical attack point". Units are moved by cursor, and only one may be moved at a time. Once all units have been moved within a round, the <b>attack</b> <b>phase</b> will begin. Any amount of friendly units may attack an opposing army; however, once a unit has been dispatched for battle it cannot be stopped until the current <b>attack</b> <b>phase</b> concludes. During the attacking phase, a separate screen displaying combat information, such as enemy numbers and casualties, is displayed. If the screen detailing the attacking phase has been turned off in the settings, the battle will instead be decided on warrants of air superiority and armaments.|$|E

50|$|Battle Isle one had {{the screen}} divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and <b>attack</b> <b>phases.</b> While one player moved his units, the other {{commanded}} his own troops {{to carry out his}} actions. Battle Isle 2 gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and <b>attack</b> <b>phases,</b> and introduced the 3-D display of combat. Battle Isle 3 was very similar to Battle Isle 2, with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. Battle Isle: The Andosian War was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we sought to verify whether network {{analyses}} {{could be used to}} identify key players in <b>attacking</b> <b>phases</b> of a professional football match and establish the main interactions and preferential linkages between attacking teammates during competitive performance. For this purpose, we examined circulation of the ball on field during randomly selected <b>attacking</b> <b>phases</b> of play in a video-taped Portuguese Premier League match. We observed six matches and notated 1488 collective attacking actions, including: passes completed, passes received, and crosses involving a total of 4126 intra-team interactions (eg., 2063 passes and crosses performed and 2063 passes and crosses received). We used Amisco® software to perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of the attacking actions. Results indicated how key individual players are instrumental in orchestrating team performance, exerting a powerful influence in creating attacking patterns of play. Our findings may help coaches and sports scientists quantify the contributions and interactions of individual team members through analysis of their relevant actions in team sports like football...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of advanced guidance laws with bearings-only measurements requires {{estimation of the}} range information. To improve estimation accuracy and satisfy the impact angle constraint, this paper proposes a two-phase optimal guidance law consisting of an observing <b>phase</b> and an <b>attacking</b> <b>phase.</b> In the observing phase, the determinant of Fisher information matrix is maximized to achieve the optimal observability and a suboptimal solution expressed by leading angle is derived analytically. Then, a terminal sliding-mode guidance law is designed to track the desired leading angle. In the followed <b>attacking</b> <b>phase,</b> an optimal guidance law is integrated with a switching term to satisfy both the impact angle constraint and the field-of-view constraint. Finally, comparison studies of the proposed guidance law and a traditional optimal guidance law are conducted on stationary targets and maneuvering targets cases. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed guidance law is able to improve the range observability and achieve better terminal performances including impact angle accuracy and miss distance...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of each player's turn, {{based on the number of}} countries the player owns and whole continents the player holds, the player gains additional MODs and energy. The player places the MODs and then has the opportunity to buy additional commanders, cards, and space stations. Then the player may play command cards that he has sufficient energy to activate. Next comes the <b>attack</b> <b>phase</b> which, if the player successfully takes three contested territories, the player receives one bonus energy and one bonus command card. After the <b>attack</b> <b>phase,</b> the player may move one group of units from any one of the player's territories to any other territory the player occupies, so long as both territories are connected by a path of his own territories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{the time}} that a {{hypersonic}} vehicle experiences the reentry segment, the environment changes dramatically. This paper analyzes all kinds of constraint conditions of the reentry process, then designs the reentry corridor in both the D V − plane and the H V − plane, and analyzes the influence of various factors on the reentry corridor according to that. Based on the constraint conditions, the reentry segment is divided into the initial descent <b>phase,</b> angle of <b>attack</b> recovery <b>phase,</b> overload hold phase and angle of <b>attack</b> transition <b>phase.</b> Meanwhile the rationality of the design is verified by simulation...|$|R

50|$|The AS.34 Kormoran (cormorant) is a German-produced anti-ship missile. The Kormoran uses an {{inertial}} guidance system for the midcourse phase, switching to active radar homing during the terminal <b>attack</b> <b>phase.</b> It carries a 165 kg (363 lb) delay-fused warhead, designed for 90mm of penetration prior to detonation. The maximum range is 23 km (~14 miles).|$|E
50|$|During the <b>Attack</b> <b>phase,</b> {{the enemy}} team's hangar becomes unlocked. This allows for boardings to take place, {{typically}} using the Gunship. The {{team on the}} <b>Attack</b> <b>phase</b> has 5 minutes to successfully land and capture a subsystem. Once a subsystem has been captured, the timer is frozen until the defenders can push the attackers off their ship. Most subsystems have a function, when disabled, hurts the defending team. Capturing Shields will disable the shields of the ship, making it take more damage. Capturing Weapons will disable the ship's turrets, stop it from firing at the other capital ship, and nearby fighters outside will not receive extra munitions. The Hangar has no function, but serves as a forward spawn point near the fighters. Some NGM ships have a capturable Flight Deck; {{it does not have}} any function, and when captured does not stop the timer but stops the game from changing phases.|$|E

50|$|Until then, {{the most}} popular tactic was the metodo, a more {{defensive}} arrangement whose strength was mainly the counterattack, which had allowed the Italy national team of Vittorio Pozzo to win the 1934 and 1938 World Cups. In defence, {{there were only two}} fullbacks and a defensive midfielder which shuttled forward on the offence. In midfield, the offence was set by the centre midfielders, while the wingers were designed to serve the ball for the striker. The <b>attacking</b> <b>phase</b> was not easy, as the offside rule stipulated there must be three players between the striker and the goal, therefore only one defender had to advance to trigger the offside trap.|$|R

40|$|A {{helicopter}} simulation {{was conducted}} to examine the interaction between voice-activated controls and altitude-hold automation. A single-pilot scout/attack helicopter with conventional controls was simulated with full out-the-window computer-generated imagery. Helicopter pilots performed simulated missions which included hover, cruise and ground <b>attack</b> <b>phases.</b> For half of the flights, voice-activated controls were used instead of manual controls, for two flight tasks (weapon selection and data-burst transmission). Hover performance during data-burst hover improved when voice-activation was used. However, subjective ratings indicated higher workload levels with voice-activation. An altitude-hold automation manipulation was crossed with the voice-activation/manual manipulation. Altitude-hold automation provided two significant benefits: (1) pilots were able to hover with less lateral movement; and (2) pilots reported less workload. However, there was a performance cost associated with the automation. Pilots were significantly slower in responding to unexpected events during hover...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{new threat}} of the Internet, but little known to the 'general public' is {{constituted}} by botnets.

Values of interpersonal distance between players were recorded {{from the moment}} at which a teammate performed the pass to the ball carrier, to the moment of pass initiation by the ball carrier. Our results revealed that performance of passing actions was constrained by a convergence in interpersonal distance values between players. Pass efficacy seemed to be constrained by changes in interpersonal distance values between the ball carrier and the 2 nd defender without a correspondent adaptation in ball velocity. Based on our results, we suggest three training phases for developing passing performance in Futsal by manipulating key constraints in the performance environment relative to the interpersonal distance values between players...|$|R
