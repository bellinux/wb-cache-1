5|$|A few {{controversial}} {{studies have}} linked performance to initials.

Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough <b>and</b> <b>Williams</b> criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{testimony}} of Seymour, Power, <b>and</b> <b>Williams,</b> it became clear the jury could not convict Williams based on witness testimony alone. There was, however, some circumstantial evidence: an empty holster found by the police among Williams' possessions showed evidence of a revolver recently being inside it. The police enlisted the aid of {{an expert in the}} new science of forensic ballistics, Robert Churchill; {{it was one of the}} first times the police made use of ballistics in a case.|$|E
5|$|Glenn Richards, Adam Donovan and David Williams {{grew up and}} {{attended}} school in Shepparton, Victoria. Richards began writing songs while studying English at university in 1996. He invited Donovan <b>and</b> <b>Williams,</b> who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE, to join him; they in turn asked classmate Edmondo Ammendola to join in. The band took their name from the 1954 novel The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow, citing its poetic, complex prose {{as a reflection of}} Richards' vocals.|$|E
5|$|However, Seymour later recanted her story, {{and another}} man came forth {{claiming}} to know {{the identity of the}} real killer. This new evidence, along with the behaviour of the judge in both the initial case and the appeal, made the case controversial enough that Members of Parliament from the three major political parties directly questioned the Home Secretary on the matter. Despite many requests for clemency, all appeals were denied, <b>and</b> <b>Williams</b> was executed in 1913. The case {{was one of the first}} investigations in Britain to use the emerging science of ballistics.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} trap Williams, Power asked Williams {{to meet him}} at Moorgate Street Station the {{following}} day.
