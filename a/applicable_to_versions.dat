40|$|The use of {{programming}} teams offers both {{advantages and disadvantages}} when compared with individual programming efforts. The team approach allows a wide range {{of programming}} skills and problem-solving perspectives to be applied to a project, and may shorten development time.

Further, without some form of code management, the risk of inadvertently overwriting the work of other team members is always present.

40|$|Abstract. A common {{approach}} to fault-tolerant software DSM {{is to take}} checkpoints with message logging. Our remote logging has low overhead because each node saves the coherence-related data into {{the memory of a}} remote node through a high-speed system area network. For more lightweight fault-tolerant DSM, in this paper, we mainly focused on eliminating shared memory checkpointing during failure-free execution. Each node independently takes the checkpoints of execution states and non-shared data only. When a node fails, it regenerates its pages from the remote copies in live nodes. In order to efficiently reconstruct pages, we also introduced a XOR-diffing technique. The diff logs, which have been created by XOR operations during failure-free execution, can be <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> any <b>version</b> of remote copies either backward or forward for recovery. Our scheme reduces the checkpointing overhead and also alleviates the imbalance in execution times among nodes due to independent checkpointing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an axiomatic foundation for recursive utility that captures {{the role of}} the timing of resolution of uncertainty without relying on exogenously specified objective beliefs. Two main representation results are proved. In the first one, future utility enters the recursion through the type of general aggregators considered in Skiadas (1997 a), and as a result the formulation is purely ordinal and free of any probabilities. In the second representation these aggregators are conditional expectations relative to subjective beliefs. A new recursive representation incorporating disappointment aversion is also suggested. The main methodological innovation of the paper derives {{from the fact that the}} basic objects of choice are taken to be pairs of state-contingent consumption plans and information filtrations, rather than the temporal (objective) lotteries of the existing literature.

40|$|Abstract. Ethernet {{has been}} the world's most {{comprehensive}} networking for more than 30 years. This popularity is due to its simplicity, maturity, low costs and a wide existing base. Fast and Gigabit Ethernet have brought more bandwidth to the technology and by transmitting from half-duplex to full-duplex link, Ethernet’s throughput has increased. With these properties Ethernet is expected {{to speed up the}} deployment and use of next generation networks and services. The current activity in building Gigabit speed networks, growing network bandwidth and intensive network applications led to flow control and congestion control became a high priority in network design and research. Recently, the IEEE congestion management study group has been set up to deal with the congestion and flow control problems in Ethernet networks. They had standardized a method (IEEE 802. 3 x standard) to provide a pause-based flow control, which is <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> all <b>version</b> of full-duplex Ethernet. The aim of this standard is to improve throughput, latency and packet loss. There are some problems for the IEEE 802. 3 x standard; for instance, pause-based flow control can potentially cause heal-of-line blocking and more congestion, and in some cases quality of service (QoS) can not operate properly due to equal punishment for different traffic priority. Recent studies carried out some of these problems and have attempted to solve them in order to improve the IEEE 802. 3 x standard. This paper analyzed and reviewed different proposed methods in terms of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} their contributions.

Part one, the present paper, focuses on timelike singularities, part two will be devoted to spacelike singularities. We use the timelike singularity of the (super-critical) Reissner-Nordstrom geometry as an example. While one could impose boundary conditions at the singularity that would prevent the particles from falling into the singularity, in the case {{we are interested in}} here particles have positive probability to hit the singularity and get annihilated. The wish for reversibility, equivariance and the Markov property then dictate that particles must also be created by the singularity, and indeed dictate the rate at which this must occur. That is, a stochastic law prescribes what comes out of the singularity. We specify explicit model equations, involving a boundary condition on the wave function at the singularity, which is <b>applicable</b> also <b>to</b> other <b>versions</b> of quantum theory besides Bohmian mechanics.

In this report, we empirically evaluate two weak- nesses in Monero's mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62 % of transaction inputs {{with one or more}} mixins are vulnerable to "chain-reaction" analysis [...] that is, the real input can be deduced by elimination, e. g. because the mixins they include are spent by 0 -mixin transactions. Sec- ond, Monero mixins are sampled {{in such a way that}} the mixins can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually the "newest" input. We estimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80 % accuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins.
