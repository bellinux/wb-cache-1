The genus Tetragnatha Latreille, 1804 has been known from 56 species in the Australasian region (Roewer, 1942; Brignoli 1983). However, no detailed study of the genus {{has been made in}} this vast geographical region. Recently I was able to study the Australasian tetragnathid spiders based on the collection of the several museums and institutions. As a result 31 species were recognized from Australia, New Guinea and neighboring islands. Of these, 3 species are already known as the cosmopolitan species (Okuma, 1983). The present paper gives the descriptions of 11 new species and the redescriptions of 17 known species. Illustrations of important characters as well as measurements of the relative lengths of legs of the 31 species are also presented. The number of materials examined, and the abbreviations of the museums and the institutions are as follows : BMH : Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, 356 specimens. AMS : Australian Museum, Sydney, 181 specimens. NSMT : National Science Museum, Tokyo, 17 specimens. KUF : Entomological Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 72 specimens. Terminology of the cheliceral armature of Tetragnatha was established by Wiehle (1939). Later, Locket & Millidge (1953) adopted his terminology and translated it in English in their book, British Spiders. In the present paper, the terms are used according to Locket & Millidge. In addition, some new terms are provided. These are summarized as follows (an asterisk shows a new term) : a : An apophysis, used for locking the female’s fang during copulation. “Gu : The guide tooth of upper row. *Gl : The guide tooth of lower row. *e : An extra tooth found between (Gu) and (T) in the female of some species.

40|$|Rapidly {{deployable}} mobile bridges are {{of direct}} relevance to {{military and civilian}} agencies. The US Army uses such bridges in {{a broad range of}} applications including assault, tactical, and general communication. Civilian use extends from temporary infrastructure improvements during natural disasters to planned situations that are equally critical. This paper describes a modular bridge system developed primarily for use in assault scenarios where rapid deployment is vital, but this design concept is also relevant in civil applications. The robust metallic design of the bridge is based on an aluminum trussed arch reinforced by steel cables. The segmental form of the structure allows it to be folded into a compact package for transportation in a standard 40 ft container, which facilitates shipping by road, rail, sea, or air (C- 130 transport aircraft). The bridge segments also facilitate adaptation of the bridge to different spans ranging from 8 m to 32 m. The load rating for these spans varies between 100 T and 40 T respectively. The preferred deployment approach for the assault configuration uses a scissor method in conjunction with a winching mechanism mounted on an <b>auxiliary</b> bridge <b>guide.</b> Compared to more conventional techniques, this method reduces the demands on the bridge launcher. The complete system provides an integrated solution to cover a broad spectrum of bridging applications. Extensive computer analysis was used to refine and optimize the components in the bridge.

However, during the past decade, state-of-the-art SAT solvers rarely incorporated symmetry breaking.

We investigate three methods to construct more effective symmetry breaking formulas. The first method simply improves the encoding of symmetry breaking formulas. The second detects special symmetry subgroups, for which complete symmetry breaking formulas exist. The third infers binary symmetry breaking clauses for a symmetry group as a whole rather than longer clauses for individual symmetries. We implement these methods in a symmetry breaking preprocessor, and verify their effectiveness on both hand-picked problems as well as the 2014 SAT competition benchmark set. Our experiments indicate that our symmetry breaking preprocessor improves the current state-of-the-art in static symmetry breaking for SAT and has a sufficiently low overhead to improve the performance of modern SAT solvers on hard combinatorial instances. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} two elementary {{forms of}} string rewriting called guided insertion/deletion and guided rewriting. The original strings are modified {{depending on the}} match with a given set of <b>auxiliary</b> strings, called <b>guides.</b> Guided insertion/deletion considers matching of a string and a guide {{with respect to a}} specific correspondence of strings. Guided rewriting considers matching of a string and a guide with respect to an equivalence relation on the alphabet. Guided insertion/deletion is inspired by {RNA}-editing, a biological process by which the original genetic information stored in DNA is modified before its final expression. The formalism here allows for simultaneous insertion and deletion of string elements. Guided rewriting, based on a letter-to-letter relation, is technically more appealing than guided insertion/deletion. We prove that guided rewriting preserves regularity: for every regular language its closure under guided rewriting is regular too. In the proof we will rely on the auxiliary notion of a slice sequence. We establish a correspondence of slice sequences and guide rewrite sequences. Because of their left-to-right nature, slice sequences are more convenient to deal with than guided rewrite sequences {{in the construction of the}} finite automata that we encounter in the proofs of regularity.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, a {{considerable}} number of research articles have been published relating to the structure and function of the major photosynthetic protein complexes, photosystem (PS) I, PSII, cytochrome (Cyt) b 6 f, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. Sequencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) genome together with several high-quality proteomics studies has, however, revealed that the thylakoid membrane network of plant chloroplasts still contains a number of functionally unknown proteins. These proteins may have a role as <b>auxiliary</b> proteins <b>guiding</b> the assembly, maintenance, and turnover of the thylakoid protein complexes, or they may be as yet unknown subunits of the photosynthetic complexes. Novel subunits {{are most likely to be}} found in the NAD(P) H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex, the structure and function of which have remained obscure in the absence of detailed crystallographic data, thus making this thylakoid protein complex a particularly interesting target of investigation. In this thesis, several novel thylakoid-associated proteins were identified by proteomics-based methods. The major goal of characterization of the stroma thylakoid associated polysome-nascent chain complexes was to determine the proteins that guide the dynamic life cycle of PSII. In addition, a large protein complex of ≥ 1, 000 kDa, residing in the stroma thylakoid, was characterized in greater depth and it was found to be a supercomplex composed of the PSI and NDH complexes. A set of newly identified proteins from Arabidopsis thylakoids was subjected to detailed characterization using the reverse genetics approach and extensive biochemical and biophysical analysis. The role of the novel proteins, either as auxiliary proteins or subunits of the photosynthetic protein complexes, was revealed. Two novel thylakoid lumen proteins, TLP 18. 3 and AtCYP 38, function as auxiliary proteins assisting specific steps of the assembly/repair of PSII. The role of the 10 -kDa thylakoid lumen protein PsbR is related to the optimization of oxygen evolution of PSII by assisting the assembly of the PsbP protein. Two integral thylakoid membrane proteins, NDH 45 and NDH 48, are novel subunits of the chloroplast NDH complex. Finally, the thylakoid lumen immunophilin AtCYP 20 - 2 is suggested to interact with the NDH complex, instead of PSII as was hypothesized earlier...|$|R
40|$|View {{maintenance}} {{is a problem}} in data management that arises whenever a view is materialized over a source that changes over time. When the source is large, or when the source and view reside on different hosts, it is not practical to recompute the view and retransmit it over the network each time the source is updated. A better idea, commonly used in systems built with view maintenance in mind, is to translate source updates to ones that {{can be applied to the}} view directly. The cost of calculating, transmitting, and applying a translated update is typically dramatically less than the cost of recomputing and retransmitting the entire view. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining XQuery views over XML data. The core algorithm translates updates through queries as expressed in the tree algebra used internally in the Galax engine. This algorithm extends previous work on maintenance for relational views, although there are significant complications due to the data model, which is both ordered and nested. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a scheme for storing <b>auxiliary</b> data that <b>guides</b> the translation of updates in this more complicated setting. A novel aspect of our approach compared to previous work is that the amount and content of annotations can be controlled by users, making it possible to balance the tradeoffs between the size of the auxiliary data and the quality of translated updates. We have built a prototype implementation to test these ideas. Our system extends Galax, and handles a core set of operators and built-in functions capable of expressing many typical firstorder queries. Its design is fully compositional, so it can easily be extended to new operators. We present preliminary results of experiments run on benchmark queries from the XMark suite...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{regulatory}} network (GRN) {{consists of}} a set of genes and regulatory relationships between the genes. As outputs of the GRN, gene expression data contain important information {{that can be used to}} reconstruct the GRN to a certain degree. However, the reverse engineer of GRNs from gene expression data is a challenging problem in systems biology. Conventional methods fail in inferring GRNs from gene expression data because of the relative less number of observations compared with the large number of the genes. The inherent noises in the data make the inference accuracy relatively low and the combinatorial explosion nature of the problem makes the inference task extremely difficult. This study aims at reconstructing the GRNs from time-course gene expression data based on GRN models using system identification and parameter estimation methods. The main content consists of three parts: (1) a review of the methods for reverse engineering of GRNs, (2) reverse engineering of GRNs based on linear models and (3) reverse engineering of GRNs based on a nonlinear model, specifically S-systems. In the first part, after the necessary background and challenges of the problem are introduced, various methods for the inference of GRNs are comprehensively reviewed from two aspects: models and inference algorithms. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. The second part focus on inferring GRNs from time-course gene expression data based on linear models. First, the statistical properties of two sparse penalties, adaptive LASSO and SCAD, with an autoregressive model are studied. It shows that the proposed methods using these two penalties can asymptotically reconstruct the underlying networks. This provides a solid foundation for these methods and their extensions. Second, the integration of multiple datasets should be able to improve the accuracy of the GRN inference. A novel method, Huber group LASSO, is developed to infer GRNs from multiple time-course data, which is also robust to large noises and outliers that the data may contain. An efficient algorithm is also developed and its convergence analysis is provided. The third part can be further divided into two phases: estimating the parameters of S-systems with system structure known and inferring the S-systems without knowing the system structure. Two methods, alternating weighted least squares (AWLS) and <b>auxiliary</b> function <b>guided</b> coordinate descent (AFGCD), have been developed to estimate the parameters of S-systems from time-course data. AWLS takes advantage of the special structure of S-systems and significantly outperforms one existing method, alternating regression (AR). AFGCD uses the auxiliary function and coordinate descent techniques to get the smart and efficient iteration formula and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Without knowing the system structure, taking advantage of the special structure of the S-system model, a novel method, pruning separable parameter estimation algorithm (PSPEA) is developed to locally infer the S-systems. PSPEA is then combined with continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) to form a hybrid algorithm which can globally reconstruct the S-systems...|$|R
