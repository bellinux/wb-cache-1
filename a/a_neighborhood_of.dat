5|$|In 1870, Stone and Blackwell {{moved from}} New Jersey to Dorchester, Massachusetts, which today is <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Boston {{just south of}} downtown. There they {{purchased}} Pope's Hill, a seventeen-room house with extensive grounds and several outbuildings. Many of the town's women had {{been active in the}} Dorchester Female Anti-Slavery Society and, by 1870, a number of local women were suffragists.|$|E
5|$|San Marco is <b>a</b> <b>{{neighborhood}}</b> <b>of</b> Jacksonville, Florida, {{south of}} Downtown across the St. Johns River. The neighborhood was formerly the independent city of South Jacksonville {{until it was}} annexed by Jacksonville in 1932. The neighborhood is primarily residential, with an integrated commercial sector known as San Marco Square.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and filmed at Universal Studios. The video features Brown in various dance sequences in <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> old time storefronts and brownstones. It also features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows, including Dancing with the Stars, Today and the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. It was also included on the set list of his 2011 F.A.M.E. Tour.|$|E

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
5|$|The growing African-American {{population}} {{settling in}} the South Side bordered <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Irish Americans existing since {{the mid-19th century}} and the two groups competed for jobs and housing. African-American migrants arrived after waves of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe; there were competition and tensions in their relationships, too. Ethnic groups were possessive of their neighborhoods, which their young men often patrolled against outsiders. Because of agricultural problems, Southern whites also migrated to the city, about 20,000 by this period. The rapid influx of migrants caused overcrowding {{as a result of}} a lack of adequate low-cost housing.|$|E
5|$|The surname of his Dutch historian, Diedrich Knickerbocker, is {{generally}} associated with New York and New Yorkers, and {{can still be}} seen across the jerseys of New York's professional basketball team, albeit in its more familiar, abbreviated form, reading simply Knicks. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> New York City, there are two parallel streets named Irving Avenue and Knickerbocker Avenue; the latter forms {{the core of the}} neighborhood's shopping district.|$|E

5|$|Leland {{is home to}} Fishtown, and the ferries to the Manitou Islands off {{the coast}} of the Leelanau Peninsula. Continuing northward, M-22 reaches its northernmost extent in Northport before turning south. It passes through the {{reservation}} of the Grand Traverse Band of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in Peshawbestown, home to one of the tribe's two casinos. Further south is the community of Suttons Bay located on the small bay of the same name. From here south, the highway runs just off the shore of the Grand Traverse Bay south to Greilickville. Just south of Greilickville, M-22 enters a section of the city of Traverse City that's located in Leelanau County, Michigan formed by an acquisition of <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Greilickville. Here is the eastern junction between M-22 and M-72. The two highways run concurrently along Grandview Parkway to Division Street. There they meet US31/M-37 and M-22 ends. A portion of this road has been designated a what is now called a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by the state of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} I-5 near the Mexican border {{in a far}} south part of San Ysidro, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a {{junction}} with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide {{between rich and poor}} in the city of Chula Vista; those on {{the eastern side of the}} freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{his fellow}} band members, Fafa – born 13 May 1954 in Ampasamadinika, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Antananarivo – has based his career entirely around singing. He {{was raised in}} a musical family: his father played {{mandolin}} and his mother enjoyed singing. Fafa began playing guitar at the age of nine and sang along with popular European and American artists on the radio, including Harry Belafonte, Claude François and Mike Brant. Fafa discontinued his studies after the 1972 rotaka and returned with his wife and son (born in 1973) to live with his parents in Antananarivo. There he obtained a position at the Ministry of Transportation, becoming the first salaried member of the group. For the first three decades of his career, Fafa often recorded and performed in collaboration with other artists and groups. He released his first solo album in 2008 to strong sales across Madagascar. In the late 1990s Fafa led a successful campaign to increase access to public latrines in the impoverished Antananarivo neighborhood of Isotry.|$|E

5|$|Youngstown State University, {{the primary}} {{institution}} of higher learning in the Youngstown-Warren metropolitan area, traces its origins to a local YMCA program that began offering college-level courses in 1908. YSU joined the Ohio system {{of higher education in}} 1967. The university consists of six colleges: The College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS); The College of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM); The Willamson College of Business; The Bitonte College of Health and Human Services; The College of Fine and Performing Arts (FPA), and the College of Education. Once regarded as a commuter school, YSU serves about 13,000 students, many from outside the Youngstown area. The campus is just north of the city's downtown and south of Youngstown's historic Fifth Avenue district, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Tudor-, Victorian-, and Spanish Colonial Revival-style homes.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of a Hausdorff space says that points can be separated by neighborhoods. It turns out that this implies something which is seemingly stronger: in a Hausdorff space every pair of disjoint compact sets can also be separated by neighborhoods, in other words there is <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> one set and <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> the other, such that the two neighborhoods are disjoint. This {{is an example of}} the general rule that compact sets often behave like points.|$|E
