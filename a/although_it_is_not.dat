5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{show that}} there is a 0.41 probability that the moon Halimede collided with Nereid at some time in the past. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known whether any collision has taken place, both moons appear to have similar ("grey") colors, implying that Halimede could be a fragment of Nereid.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear that this {{happened}} on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: {{the language of the}} upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped {{in the form of the}} Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known with {{certainty}} how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float {{on the water}} surface for dispersal. L.incarnatum is homothallic, a mode of reproduction commonly employed by marine fungi that may confer a competitive advantage in marine environments.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Mesolithic people settled {{in the region of}} York between 8000 and 7000BC, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but, later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|By 1928 he was {{reportedly}} working on film adaptations of the folktales Roro Mendut and Prono Tjitro, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known if he finished them. He did, however, complete a documentary entitled Het Groote Mekka-Feest (The Great Mecca Feast) which followed hajj pilgrims from the Indies during their trip to Mecca. The film premiered in Leiden, the Netherlands, on November 8, 1928. This premiere {{was attended by}} numerous Dutch socialites, including Princess Juliana, and given an introduction by Dutch Orientalist Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales. The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E

5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible to numerically integrate its orbit {{for more than a}} few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{played football}} for Mitchell Main {{in the winter}} of 1912–13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took their place in the First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (<b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is unclear how often he represented the club.|$|E

Certain levels make use of the siege engine (A new feature to the series) and introduce specialized siege equipment such as bridge layers, battering rams and catapults to the stage. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> essential for the completion of stages, having a siege weapon will increase morale for the player's forces, and help the player succeed.|$|E
5|$|Mass transit in Lethbridge {{consists}} of 40buses (with {{an average age}} of 10years) operating on more than a dozen routes. Traditionally, bus routes in the city started and ended downtown. In the early 21st century, however, Lethbridge Transit introduced cross-town and shuttle routes, such as University of Lethbridge to Lethbridge College, University of Lethbridge to the North Lethbridge terminal, and Lethbridge College to the North Lethbridge terminal. Several routes converge near the Chinook Regional Hospital, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> officially a terminal.|$|E
