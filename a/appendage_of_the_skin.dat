40|$|The hair {{follicle}} {{is a highly}} complex <b>appendage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> containing a multiplicity of cell types. The follicle undergoes constant cycling through {{the life of the}} organism including growth and resorption with growth dependent on specific stem cells. The targeting of the follicle by genes and stem cells to change its properties, in particular, the nature of the hair shaft is, discussed. Hair follicle delivery systems are described, such as liposomes and viral vectors for gene therapy. The nature of the {{hair follicle}} stem cells is discussed, in particular, its pluripotency...|$|E
40|$|Hair is an <b>appendage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in the beauty of people's face. Daily averages of 50 to 80 hairs are shed naturally. Various factors are effective in hair loss. In this paper using the eight influence attributes of gender, age, genetic factors, surgery, pregnancy, Zinc deficiency, iron deficiency, anemia and the use of cosmetics, the amount of hair loss is predicted. This work has been performed using artificial neural networks. 60 percent of the collected data was used for train, 20 percent for validation and the remaining 20 percent is used for testing the neural networks. For this, various training algorithms has been used. The result of the implementation of these algorithms has been compared. It seems that neural networks can be successful to predict hair loss...|$|E
40|$|T 4 N 5 liposomes, {{which contain}} the DNA repair enzyme T 4 {{endonuclease}} V, {{were applied to}} mouse skin in vivo and added to cultured murine keratinocytes in vitro. <b>The</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposome membrane was followed using a fluorescent, lipophilic dye, and <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme was traced by immunogold labeling, followed by brightfield, fluorescence, or transmission electron microscopy. In vivo, T 4 N 5 liposomes penetrated the stratum corneum, localized in epidermis and <b>appendages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> and were found inside basal keratinocytes. The enzyme was found inside keratinocytes treated in vitro and in the epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands of topically treated skin. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> liposomes in <b>the</b> cytoplasm <b>of</b> cells in <b>the</b> epidermis often concentrated in a perinuclear location. The enzyme was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm of keratinocytes and Langerhans cells. Liposomes were found in cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lymph nodes draining <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> contact sensitization, in association with topically applied antigen. The results demonstrate that liposomes can deliver encapsulated proteins into cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> in vivo and provide insight into how liposome-enhanced DNA repair reduces UV-induced skin cancer and systemic immuno-suppression in mice...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} cases of skin diseases in children. <b>The</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> such afflictions {{is often a}} challenge but also of high interest for dermatologists and paediatricians. About every fourth consultation at a paediatrician is about skin symptoms and more than 10 percent of all in-hospital patients under <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 15 are admitted for a skin disease. This study established a new database to comprehend the different illnesses and their aspects. In this database <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> all underage patients, newly admitted to the outpatient clinic for dermatology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CharitÃ© between the 01 / 01 / 2004 and 03 / 31 / 2009 was included retrospectively. This study therefore shows <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> all patients under <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 18, treated in the university outpatient clinic in recent years. In 2007 and 2008 about 300 new patients were treated per year. Furthermore the data shows that most children are relatively young at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> first contact. <b>The</b> absolute number <b>of</b> new patients recedes with increasing age. The analysis showed that the most common diagnoses were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appendages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> dermatitis and eczema, neoplasia, congenital dysplasia and infections. This is of special interest to plan and establish new specialised consultations. With this new data <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> specialisation, further training for pediatricians and new studies is easier to access. For example <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> consultation hours for hair and nail diseases seemed appropriate, whereas the general appointment hours needed to be extended. More than 50 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> admitted patients were forwarded by a paediatrician, which shows {{that there is a}} a high demand for clarification with parents and doctors. In addition it was concluded that there is need for more out of hospital paediatric dermatologists. At present there is no medical specialisation for paediatric dermatology in Germany, but a general curriculum should be worked out. This would help parents and physicians to have faith in the diagnose and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Early {{repair of}} skin injury and maximal {{restoration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> function and appearance have become important targets of clinical treatment. In the present study, we observed <b>the</b> healing process <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> defects in nude mice and structural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>skin</b> after transplantation of isolated and cultured adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) onto the human acellular amniotic membrane (AAM). The result showed that ADMSCs were closely attached to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> AAM and grew well 24 [*]h after seeding. Comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wound healing rate at days 7, 14, and 28 after transplantation showed that ADMSCs seeded on AAM facilitated <b>the</b> healing <b>of</b> full-thickness <b>skin</b> wounds more effectively {{as compared with}} either hAM or AAM alone, indicating that ADMSCs participated in skin regeneration. More importantly, we noticed a phenomenon of hair follicle development during <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> repair. Composite ADMSCs and AAM not only promoted <b>the</b> healing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouse full-thickness defects but also facilitated generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appendages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected <b>skin,</b> thus promoting restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> function. Our results provide a new possible therapy idea for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> wounds with respect to both anatomical regeneration and functional restoration...|$|R
40|$|For the {{evaluation}} and quantification of follicular penetration processes, <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> variations of hair follicle parameters in different body sites is basic. Characteristics of follicle sizes and potential follicular reservoir were determined in cyanoacrylate skin surface biopsies, taken from seven different skin areas (lateral forehead, back, thorax, upper arm, forearm, thigh, and calf region). The highest hair follicle density {{and percentage of}} follicular orifices on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface and infundibular surface {{were found on the}} forehead, whereas the highest average size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> follicular orifices was measured in the calf region. The highest infundibular volume and therefore a potential follicular reservoir was calculated for the forehead and for the calf region, although the calf region showed the lowest hair follicle density. The calculated follicular volume of these two skin areas was as high as <b>the</b> estimated reservoir <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stratum corneum. The lowest values for every other parameter were found on the forearm. The present investigation clearly contradicts former hypothesis that <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>appendages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>skin</b> surface represents not more than 0. 1 %. Every body region disposes its own hair follicle characteristics, which, in the future, should lead us to a differential evaluation of skin penetration processes and a completely different understanding of penetration of topically applied drugs and cosmetics...|$|R

50|$|By contrast, Steiner {{held that}} uncoerced, freely {{self-organizing}} forms of cooperative economic life, {{in a society}} where there is freedom of speech, of culture, and of religion, will 1) make State intervention in the economy less necessary or called for, and 2) will tend to permit economic interests of a broader, more public-spirited sort to play a greater role in relations extending from the economy to the State. Those two changes would keep State and economy apart more than could absolute economic competition in which economic special interests corrupt the State and make it too often resemble a mere <b>appendage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. In Steiner's view, the latter corruption leads in turn to a pendulum swing in the opposite direction: government forces, sometimes with <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> intentions, seek to turn the economy increasingly into a mere <b>appendage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State. State and economy thus merge through an endless iteration of pendulum swings from one to the other, increasingly becoming corrupt <b>appendages</b> <b>of</b> each other.|$|R
