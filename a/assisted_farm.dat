In looking to the future, farm managers need to assess where the current farming system is taking them, and whether changing to an alternative farming system might be more profitable. There are various techniques for assessing the profitability of alternative farming systems, but frequently the cost of transition is overlooked. The financial consequences of transition to a new farming system are assessed for two case study farms using a spreadsheet tool (STEP), developed by the authors.

Since then, research has been focused and dedicated to obtain the most benefit out of it. Therefore, genomic selection changed the way breeding companies were operating. However, {{most of the research}} performed was focused on genetic improvement which was largely {{due to the fact that}} genomic selection played a significant role in reducing the generation interval, while increasing accuracy. But recently researchers have been becoming interested to understand if genomic selection could also <b>assist</b> in making <b>farm</b> decisions. Raising genetically superior heifers for cow replacement with minimum cost is the objective of most of dairy farmers. However, cost of raising heifer replacement has been overlooked.

Therefore, in the current study, it has been found that genomic selection could be economically beneficial in <b>assisting</b> <b>farm</b> management decisions if a farm has large herd size coupled with the practice of low replacement rates, as such farms may have more surplus heifers which farmers could select from.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of the {{sustainability}} of policies of agricultural diversification towards tourism which is emphasised in the programmes of rural development in many agricultural regions, like those of the “convergence objective” on which the analysis concentrated. In the paper it is pointed out that the way the regional authorities incentivate or <b>assist</b> <b>farms</b> to diversify into tourism could have implications for sustainability, examined in this study thorough the presence of five indicators. The weight of these per region, obtained from the combination of structural variables (number of accommodation facilities and of beds) and of flows (arrivals and presences) registered in farm tourism, was estimated by applying Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) to the variation in presences recorded in the period 2002 - 2011. By introducing the institutional aspect of the sustainability of rural development processes, the paper also identifies “integrated rural tourism” as the most effective model of tourism diversification for farms, since this brings the focus back onto the local food producing system...|$|R

The risk of lice comes from three main sources: (i) lice may have been present at the previous shearing and not eradicated; (ii) lice may have been introduced with purchased sheep; and (iii) lice may have entered with strays. A Bayesian network is used to assess the probability of each of these events independently and combine them for an overall assessment. Rubbing is a common indicator of lice but there are other causes too. If rubbing has been observed, an additional Bayesian network is used to assess the probability that lice are the cause. The presence or absence of rubbing and its possible cause are combined with these networks to improve the overall risk assessment...|$|R

Furthermore, agencies with jurisdiction over CAFOs are typically environmental or natural resource state-run agencies, as opposed to local health departments. This is an advantage for addressing environmental impacts but a disadvantage for human health concerns, as the majority of local health issues get overlooked by state-run agencies. Additionally, although there are laws and regulations in place, such as the Swine Farm Environmental Performance Standards Act, which prohibits new waste lagoons and mandates that new CAFOs must use technology that will prevent discharge of waste, these regulations do not mandate for existing CAFOs to clean up or regulate the pollutants within their lagoons. These regulations also make it more costly to clean up these wastes and prevent other consequential harms, without actually <b>assisting</b> <b>farms</b> in shouldering these costs, making {{it difficult for them to}} actually act on these regulations.|$|R

Their results confirm that-unlike for other agricultural subsidies and tariffs-for cotton it is subsidy reductions rather than tariff cuts that would make by far the largest impact. For Sub-Saharan Africa the potential gains are huge relative to the effects on that region of reforming other merchandise trade policies. And they could be more than doubled if that reform provided the cash for farmers {{to take advantage of the}} biotechnology revolution and adopt GM cotton varieties.
