Several commentaries on Buddhism, known as Atthakatha have also been written during {{the reign of}} Mahanama (406–428). Pali chronicles such as Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa have been written during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> useful as {{resources}} for studying the history of the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls were}} largely {{maintained}} intact {{during most of}} the Ottoman period, until sections began to be dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries. Despite the subsequent lack of maintenance, many parts of the walls survived <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> standing today. A large-scale restoration program has been under way since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{measures}} taken in storage facilities do not decrease {{the proportion of}} damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and therefore the pressure for the coming year. Such measures will be especially efficient in storage as most B. rufimanus have then not yet emerged <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> developing in the seeds. Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control measures in storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E

5|$|Dromedaries {{were also}} shipped from {{south-western}} Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia. Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD. Camels were exported to the Canary Islands in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> extant there, especially in Lanzarote {{and to the}} south of Fuerteventura. Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|In January 1959 he {{was offered}} the honorary abbotship of Poh Ern Shih, thus {{becoming}} the first Westerner to be the abbot of a Buddhist temple in Singapore. While in Singapore, he assisted Pitt Chin Hui in her translation of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra from Chinese to English. He returned to Malaya and spent his later years at Penang Buddhist Association, where most of his Dharma lectures were held. His lectures were later compiled in English and Chinese <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> freely distributed. Venerable Sumangalo died on 6 February 1963 and was cremated in Penang.|$|E

5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done {{on a small scale}} {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely to}} eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mills}} {{built in the}} Derwent Valley for the cotton {{industry}} survive and were reused after {{the decline of the}} industry. Some have been reused. Most of the worker's housing survives <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in used as homes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, local authorities in partnership with English Heritage attempted to prevent the deterioration of the houses and mills by giving advice to owners and using grants to undertake conservation work. When the application for World Heritage Site status was made in 2000, 26 of the 838listed buildings in the area were on English Heritage's At Risk Register and were in a state of disrepair.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the rules}} in the Sheffield game were adopted by <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{featured}} in today’s association game. Twelve changes {{were made to the}} FA code between 1863 and 1870, of which eight were taken from Sheffield Rules. During this period the Sheffield FA had significant influence over the FA and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867. The corner kick was adopted by the FA in 1872 and they restricted handling of the ball to the goalkeeper's own half in 1873. In the final negotiations between Sheffield and London the latter agreed to allow throw-ins in any direction in exchange.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the chapel is a range of buildings including the lodgings of the Military Knights, and the residence of the Governor of the Military Knights. These buildings originate from the 16th century <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> used by the Knights, who represent the Order of the Garter each Sunday. On the south side of the Ward is King Henry VIII's gateway, which bears the coat of arms of Catherine of Aragon and forms the secondary entrance to the castle.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E

Sixty-six trainsets consisting of six cars each and a single money trainset consisting of four cars were purchased. These trains are operated by SMRT Trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of Ely's name have always been {{regarded}} as obscure by place-name scholars, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> disputed. The earliest record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This is apparently not a Latin name, and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the spelling is usually Elig.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada).
