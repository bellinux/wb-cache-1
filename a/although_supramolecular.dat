40|$|<b>Although</b> <b>supramolecular</b> {{chemistry}} {{is a crucial}} participant in the formation and ordering of biomacromolecules, it is only recently {{that it has been}} utilized in the field of polymer chemistry. Polymers employing non-covalent interactions are becoming important in order to form dynamic and reversible macromolecular systems. To demonstrate the strength and versatility of supramolecular applications in synthetic macromolecules, we grafted recognition dyads as sidechain functionality upon the covalently held backbone. This approach enabled us both to tune material structure and properties and to construct higher order architectures. ^ In our preliminary investigations, we studied a polystyrene-based system that self-assembled through aromatic stacking of electron-rich anthracene sidechains. We demonstrated that the complexation of this polymer with an electron-deficient guest resulted in an enhancement of thermostability to the globular polymer structure, dramatically altering the temperature dependence of polymer unfolding. ^ We then employed azobenzene units as side-chain functionality to obtain a photochemical control over the polymer solution structure. We showed that photoisomerization of the azobenzene groups caused changes in sidechain-sidechain aromatic interactions, resulting in structural modulation of the polymer. ^ Likewise, we grafted varying Donor-Acceptor-Donor hydrogen bonding sidechains to the polymer backbone to obtain more specificity in recognition. We demonstrated that intramolecular association between pendant groups resulted in folding of the polymer into a micelle-like structure in non-polar solvents. We also showed that the efficiency of recognition between the polymer and a complementary monomeric guest can be controlled through the choice of recognition element on the polymer by adjusting the balance between intra- and intermolecular interactions. We then extended the versatility of this “plug and play” strategy to bulk materials. Using spin casting, we kinetically trapped these host-guest complexes in polystyrene films, resulting in highly efficient recognition processes. ^ Furthermore, we demonstrated the encapsulation of an electroactive guest into the intramolecularly hydrogen bonded polymer through NMR and electrochemical studies. ^ Finally, we studied the intermolecular association of our polymers with other macromolecules. We demonstrated a polymer-mediated self-assembly of gold nanoparticles into highly ordered spherical arrays. We then extended this approach to the self-assembly of complementary polymer strands into giant vesicles through specific interchain hydrogen bonding. ...|$|E
40|$|Helical supramolecular architecture, such as helical foldamers, supramolecular helicates and aggregates, helical molecules, macromolecules, and oligomers, is a {{fascinating}} topic of interest in chemistry and materials science. <b>Although</b> such <b>supramolecular</b> structures may provide advantages {{in the design of}} stimuli-responsive and functional materials, the weak nature of the noncovalent forces, as well as the dependency of the dynamic process on their local environments, may hinder their possible applications because of their limited structural stability and processibility. Stabilization of these supramolecular structures could be achieved by modification of the molecular backbone with specific functional groups that permit intramolecular cross-linking, in which covalent bonds fix the secondary structure with variable degrees of fidelity.

40|$|International audienceBmrA from Bacillus subtilis is a {{half-size}} ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter {{involved in}} multidrug resistance. <b>Although</b> its <b>supramolecular</b> organization {{has been investigated}} after reconstitution in a lipid bilayer environment, and shows a dimeric and possibly a tetrameric form, the precise quaternary structure in a detergent-solubilized state has never been addressed. In the present study, BmrA was purified from Escherichia coli membranes using an optimized purification protocol and different detergents. Furthermore, the ATPase activity of BmrA and the quantity of bound lipids and detergent were determined, and the oligomeric state was analysed using SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) and analytical ultracentrifugation. The activity and the quaternary structure of BmrA appeared to be strongly influenced by the type and concentration of the detergent used. SEC data showed that BmrA could be purified in a functional form in 0. 05 and 0. 01 % DDM (n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside) and was homogeneous and monodisperse with an R(s) (Stokes radius) of 5. 6 nm that is compatible with a dimer structure. Sedimentation-velocity and equilibrium experiments unequivocally supported that BmrA purified in DDM is a dimer and excluded {{the presence of other}} oligomeric states. These observations, which are discussed in relation to results obtained in proteoliposomes, also constitute an important first step towards crystallographic studies of BmrA structure.

40|$|Photosystem I (PSI) is a pigment protein complex catalyzing the light-driven {{electron}} transport from plastocyanin to ferredoxin in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Several PSI subunits {{are highly}} conserved in cyanobacteria, algae and plants, whereas others are distributed differentially {{in the various}} organisms. Here we characterized the structural and functional properties of PSI purified from the heterokont alga Nannochloropsis gaditana, showing that it is organized as a supercomplex including a core complex and an outer antenna, as in plants and other eukaryotic algae. Differently from all known organisms, the N.  gaditana PSI supercomplex contains five peripheral antenna proteins, identified by proteome analysis as type-R light-harvesting complexes (LHCr 4 - 8). Two antenna subunits are bound in a conserved position, as in PSI in plants, whereas three additional antennae {{are associated with the}} core on the other side. This peculiar antenna association correlates with the presence of PsaF/J and the absence of PsaH, G and K in the N.  gaditana genome and proteome. Excitation energy transfer in the supercomplex is highly efficient, leading to a very high trapping efficiency as observed in all other PSI eukaryotes, showing that <b>although</b> the <b>supramolecular</b> organization of PSI changed during evolution, fundamental functional properties such as trapping efficiency were maintained...|$|R

40|$|A {{family of}} polymer {{substrates}} {{which consists of}} a vinyl backbone chain with the side groups –COO(CH 2) xH, with x = 1, 2, 4, was prepared. Substrates with similar chemical groups but decreasing stiffness, characterized by their elastic modulus at 37 °C, as well as surface mobility, characterized by the glass transition temperature, were obtained. We have investigated whether these subtle variations in polymer chemistry lead to alterations in fibronectin (FN) adsorption and mesenchymal stem cell response. The same FN density was adsorbed on every substrate ([similar] 450 ng cm− 2) <b>although</b> the <b>supramolecular</b> organization of the protein at the material interface, as obtained with AFM, was different for x = 1 {{and the other two}} surfaces (x = 2, 4). Consequently, this allows one to investigate the effect of physical properties of the matrix on stem cell differentiation after ruling out any influence of protein activity. Cell adhesion was quantified by calculating the size distribution of focal adhesions. Mesenchymal stem cell differentiation to the osteoblastic lineage was determined by quantifying protein levels for osteocalcin, osteopontin and Runx 2, {{in the absence of any}} additional osteogenic soluble factors in the culture media, but as a direct effect of material properties. The findings indicate the potential to modulate skeletal progenitor cell commitment to the osteoblastic lineage through surface mobility of the underlying material surface...|$|R
