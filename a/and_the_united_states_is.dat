25|$|Chief Justice John Marshall {{laid out}} in this opinion that the {{relationship}} between the Indian Nations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> that of nations. He reasoned that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the rights of Great Britain as they were held by that nation. Those rights, he stated, include the sole right to deal with the Indian nations in North America, to the exclusion of any other European power. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those {{are in the hands of}} the federal government, and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs.

25|$|Certified Angus Beef (CAB) in Canada <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> a specification-based, branded-beef {{program which}} was founded in 1978 by Angus cattle {{producers}} to increase demand for their breed of cattle, by promoting the impression that Angus cattle have consistent, high-quality beef with superior taste. The brand is owned by the American Angus Association and its 35,000 rancher members. The terms Angus Beef or Black Angus Beef are loosely and commonly misused or confused with CAB; this is especially common in the food service industry. The brand or name Certified Angus Beef cannot be legally used by an establishment that is not licensed to do so. In the UK the equivalent is Aberdeen Angus, marketed as higher quality and associated with stricter animal welfare rules. Notable for the herd being free of BSE during the BSE epidemic in the UK. Similar schemes are used elsewhere as in Certified Angus Beef in Ireland.|$|E

Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> the Pekin duck, which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of [...] in 44 days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.|$|E
