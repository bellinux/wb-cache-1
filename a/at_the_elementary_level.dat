25|$|Education in Eritrea {{is officially}} {{compulsory}} between seven and 13 years of age. However, the education infrastructure is inadequate to meet current needs. Statistics vary <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level,</b> suggesting that between 65 and 70% of school-aged children attend primary school; Approximately 61% attend secondary school. Student-teacher ratios are high: 45 to 1 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and 54 to 1 {{at the secondary}} level. There are an average 63 students per classroom <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and 97 per classroom at the secondary level. Learning hours at school are often less than six hours per day. The literacy rate in Eritrea is high. For men in the age 18–24 the literacy rate is 92.6% in (2008–2012), {{for women in the}} age 18–24 the literacy rate is 87.7% (2008–2012) The literacy rate for the total population is 81%,. Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional taboos, school fees (for registration and materials), and the opportunity costs of low-income households.|$|E

Admissions are very selective, reserved for students who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement and potential <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level,</b> Year/Standard 1 through 6. These schools are either full-time day or boarding schools ('asrama penuh'). Examples of these schools are Malacca High School, Royal Military College (Malaysia) and Penang Free School.|$|E

25|$|Education in Ethiopia was {{dominated}} by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s.

Some Academy {{students}} were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and received tutoring from older students. Cluff, however began implementing several changes to the school according to his experiences at Michigan. He began separation of the college from the high school, giving older students access to higher level materials. He also introduced an athletics program, which was quickly closed by the Board of Trustees (Many colleges at this time frowned on athletics programs). The school was privately supported {{by members of the}} community, and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896.|$|E

From his parents, Ilia learned the inspiring stories of Georgian heroism in classical historical novels. In his autobiography, Ilia refers to his mother, Princess Mariam Chavchavadze, who knew most Georgian novels and poems by heart and encouraged her children to study them. Ilia also described {{the influence of the}} deacon's storytelling, which gave him an artistic inspiration, later applied in his novel writing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), Jefferson had {{described}} his ideas {{for public education}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level.</b> [...] In 1817 he proposed {{a plan for a}} system of limited state public education for males only, in keeping with the times. [...] It depended on public grammar schools, and further education of a limited number of the best students, and those whose parents wanted to pay for them. The university was to be the capstone, available to only the best selected students. [...] Virginia did not establish free public education in the primary grades until after the American Civil War under the Reconstruction era legislature.|$|E

By the end of 1942 over 90 percent of the world-class art previously in Poland– as estimated by the German officials– was put into their own possession. The Polish language had been banned in Wartheland; children were forced to learn the basics of German under harsh physical punishment.

2500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, Mustafa Kemal pressed for the {{introduction}} of the new Turkish alphabet as well as made public announcements to the upcoming overhaul of the new alphabet. On 1 November 1928 he introduced the new Turkish alphabet and abolished the use of Arabic script. At the time, literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population. Dewey noted to Mustafa Kemal that learning how to read and write in Turkish with the Arabic script took roughly three years with rather strenuous methods <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>level.</b> They used the Ottoman Language written in the Arabic script with Arabic and Persian loan vocabulary. The creation of the new Turkish alphabet as a variant of the Latin alphabet was undertaken by the Language Commission (...) with the initiative of Mustafa Kemal. The tutelage was received from an Ottoman-Armenian scientist Hagop Dilaçar. The first Turkish newspaper using the new alphabet was published on 15 December 1928. Mustafa Kemal himself travelled the countryside in order to teach citizens the new alphabet. After vigorous campaigns, the literacy rate increased from 10.6% in 1927 to 22.4% in 1940. A number of congresses were organized on scientific issues, education, history, economics, arts and language. Libraries were systematically developed, mobile libraries and book transport systems were set up to serve districts and remote places. Literacy reform was also supported by strengthening the private publishing sector with a new law on copyrights.|$|E
