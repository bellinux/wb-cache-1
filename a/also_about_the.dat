5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Randor Guy, Pelli Chesi Choodu {{was the first in}} a series of satirical comedies directed by Prasad and produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Guy said the film's box office performance made Prasad famous in both Telugu and Tamil cinema. After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered as one of the acclaimed films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu. Pelli Chesi Choodu was also used as the title of a 2014 theatrical play staged by Sri Sai Arts, which won a Nandi Award.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian {{poet and}} writer Desanka Maksimović wrote {{a poem about}} the {{massacre}} titled Krvava bajka ("A Bloody Fairy Tale"). The poem was later included in the Yugoslav secondary school curriculum and schoolchildren were required to memorise it. In 1965, the Belgian poet Karel Jonckheere wrote the poem Kinderen met krekelstem ("Children with Cricket Voices"), <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> massacre. The Blue Butterfly, a book of poetry by Richard Berengarten, {{is based on the}} poet's experiences while visiting Kragujevac in 1985, when a blue butterfly landed on his hand {{at the entrance to the}} memorial museum.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{religious}} interpretations, {{there are some}} non-religious interpretations <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India.|$|E

25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public {{administration}} does not only {{focus on the}} business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.|$|E
25|$|Environmentalists are {{concerned}} about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming. Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems—of the order of 1.1×1011 metric tonnes of carbon. Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62±0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|Marx did not study {{directly}} with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied {{under one of}} Hegel's pupils, Bruno Bauer, {{a leader of the}} circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, Marx and Engels came to disagree with Bruno Bauer {{and the rest of the}} Young Hegelians about socialism and <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> usage of Hegel's dialectic. Having achieved his thesis on the Difference of natural philosophy between Democritus and Epicurus in 1841, the young Marx progressively broke away with the Prussian university and its teachings impregnated by German Idealism (Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel).|$|E

25|$|Huandacareo {{is one of}} {{many sites}} around the Cuitzeo Lake basin. It is a {{culturally}} important zone within the Michoacan region, from lake resources exploitation evidence from pre-Hispanic times. There are few studies of this type paleolithic environment in the country, in spite of information offered to anthropology. These include testimonies of the nutritional and artisan products that have been obtained throughout history, but <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> communication and transportation used by people. Not counting their importance until recently, such as hundreds of bird flocks refuge that migrate to hibernate. Given specific natural conditions, these ecological niches then worked to tie diverse human groups within the essential ancient trade networks.|$|E
25|$|The author speaks <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{decay of}} oratory, as arising {{not only from}} absence of {{personal}} freedom {{but also from the}} corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If Petronius pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, Tacitus was nearer to Longinus in thinking that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.|$|E
25|$|Larson's {{inspiration}} for Rents content came from several different sources. Many {{of the characters}} and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera La Bohème, {{the world premiere of}} which was in 1896, a century before Rents premiere. La Bohème was <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of Rents characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in Rent represents the character of Alcindoro in Bohème, but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only Rent character whose predecessor in La Bohème is the opposite sex.|$|E

25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E
500|$|Years {{after its}} release, Stone {{said of the}} film that it [...] "was the {{beginning}} of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way we look at our recent history... It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles." ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel Chiesley's tale {{inspired}} a romantic poem called [...] "Epistle from Lady Grange to Edward D— Esq" [...] written by William Erskine in 1798 and a 1905 novel entitled The Lady of Hirta, a Tale of the Isles by W. C. Mackenzie. [...] Edwin Morgan also published a sonnet in 1984 called [...] "Lady Grange on St Kilda". The Straw Chair is a two-act play by Sue Glover, <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time on St Kilda, first performed in Edinburgh in 1988. Burdalane is {{a play about}} these same events by Judith Adams performed in 1996 at the Battersea Arts Centre, London and on BBC Radio 4.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} film's subtext, {{and found it}} {{successful}} to varying degrees. Saw Tek Meng acknowledged, [...] "Sarah's experiences in the labyrinth are symbolic of her transition from child to woman" [...] but ultimately found the film [...] "too linear" [...] for its latent themes to come through. Nina Darnton compared the film's tone to the writings of E.T.A. Hoffman, stating that Hoffman's The Nutcracker [...] "is <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> voyage to womanhood, including the hint of sexual awakening, which Sarah experiences too {{in the presence of}} a goblin king." [...] Darton enjoyed the film and considered it to be more successful than Henson's previous collaboration with Brian Froud, The Dark Crystal.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Historicizing the Uses of the Past, edited by Helle Bjerg, Claudia Lenz and Erik Thorstensen, the authors {{compared}} the criticism Flame & Citron received for its historical representation to that received by , a Norwergian film <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> resistance. While Madsen's film has been highly criticized by historians, Max Manus gained {{the status of}} [...] "real past" [...] and received only a few criticisms that were dismissed by resistance veterans, politicians and even the king Harald V. Bjer et al. argued that the difference in reception {{may be attributed to}} the films' content, saying, [...] "In stark contrast to Flame & Citron, [...] doesn't challenge the notions of the right and the wrong side and the unambiguous good cause." ...|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that {{it felt like the}} book [...] "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E

500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fear of death. The section {{cut from}} the story {{highlights}} Nick's fear; the published version underscores it in a less obvious manner. In the cut section, later published as [...] "Three Shots", the night before being taken to the Indian camp Nick is left alone in the forest, where he is [...] "overwhelmed by thoughts of death". Critic Paul Strong speculates that Hemingway may have intended the narrative to be structured so that Nick's father chose to take his fearful son to the Indian camp where Nick faced the grisly reality of death, which can have done [...] "little to assuage Nick's fears." [...] Hannum believes Hemingway is intentionally vague {{about the details of}} the birth but not the death; he speculates that Nick would have likely [...] "blocked out much of the caesarian but he had clearly seen the father's head tilted back".|$|E
500|$|Moores {{identified}} in [...] "Forced to Drive" [...] the [...] "quiet-LOUD-quiet" [...] dynamic for which Deal's former band, the Pixies, are famous. Berger noticed a similar {{contrast between the}} song's [...] "pop verses" [...] and [...] "the gloom of a twisty, malignant chorus". For Abbott, this four-chord chorus [...] "approaches exuberance" [...] in its mixture of catchy melody and grunge. The penultimate track, [...] "T and T", was described by Bryant as an instrumental introduction leading into [...] "Huffer". Kelley Deal has stated that these two songs share a thematic union: the latter is about the negative side of inhaling paint or other substances, while the former stands for [...] "Toil and Trouble", <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hardships that inhaling chemicals can cause. [...] "Huffer" [...] is, according to Moores, a lively, poppy track, and critics have commented on its [...] "da-da-da" [...] and [...] "ah-ah" [...] chorus.|$|E
500|$|Mac {{experiences}} {{his spiritual}} resurrection {{even as he}} wrestles with death, in both the past—Sonny's father in the Vietnam War—and present—his own daughter in a car accident. The latter threatens to derail Mac's new life, captured in {{the moment when he}} learns of it and [...] turns off the radio that is playing his new song. Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like a pall over Tender Mercies [...] what makes this film inspiring is that it is <b>also</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, [...] "Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life." ...|$|E
