50|$|The MRO 2.4 m {{telescope}} is a Nasmyth design on an azimuth-elevation (<b>az-el)</b> <b>mount.</b> The {{telescope is}} capable of slew rates of 10 degrees per second, enabling it to observe artificial objects in low Earth orbit. The telescope is also used for asteroid studies and observations of other solar system objects. The MRO 2.4-meter achieved first light on October 31, 2006, and began regular operations on September 1, 2008, after a commissioning phase that included tracking near-Earth asteroid 2007 WD5 for NASA.|$|E

In {{a solar power}} tower system, an array of tracking mirrors or heliostats are used to concentrate the incident solar energy on an elevated stationary receiver and then the thermal energy converted to electricity using a heat engine. The conventional method of tracking are the Azimuth-Elevation (Az-El) or Target-Aligned (T-A) mount. In both the cases, the mirror is rotated about two mutually perpendicular axes and is supported at the center using a pedestal which is fixed to the ground. In this paper, a three degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator, namely the 3 -RPS, is proposed for tracking the sun in a solar power tower system. We present modeling, simulation and design of the 3 -RPS parallel manipulator and show its advantages over conventional <b>Az-El</b> and T-A <b>mounts.</b> The 3 -RPS manipulator consists of three rotary (R), three prismatic (P) and three spherical (S) joints and the mirror assembly is mounted at three points {{in contrast to the}} <b>Az-El</b> and T-A <b>mounts.</b> The kinematic equations for sun tracking are derived for the 3 -RPS manipulator and from the simulations, we obtain the range of motion of the rotary, prismatic and spherical joints. Since the mirror assembly is mounted at three points, the wind load and self-weight are distributed and as a consequence, the deflections due to loading are smaller than in conventional mounts. It is shown that the weight of the supporting structure is between 15 % and 65 % less than that of conventional systems. Hence, even though one additional actuator is used, the larger area mirrors can be used and costs can be reduced...|$|R
