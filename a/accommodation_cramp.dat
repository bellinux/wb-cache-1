25|$|However, {{many of the}} {{visitors}} {{in the first decade}} after the war were living in old, <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodations,</b> often without running water, gas or electricity.|$|R
50|$|Fitting {{the extra}} {{machinery}} {{in the same}} hull presented significant challenges, leading {{to an increase in}} weight, <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> and reduction in fuel capacity. These changes led Soviet sailors to call the Type 7U, 7 Ukhudshennyi (ухудшенный, made worse).|$|R
50|$|Like the Vs and Ws, adaptations were {{required}} for escort work. They were unpopular with officers, who found them relatively unmanoeuvrable, and with crews, whose <b>accommodation</b> was both <b>cramped</b> and damp. Nonetheless, they filled a need {{at a critical}} time.|$|R
50|$|Convicts {{worked from}} sunrise to sunset. Agricultural {{work was done}} with hoes and spades, and no ploughs or working cattle were used. Convict <b>accommodation</b> was <b>cramped</b> and unsanitary and this, {{combined}} with their poor diet of one meal every 48 hours, resulted in poor health and many deaths. The harshness and degradation of the treatment metered out to the convicts was intended to break them. Floggings were common, even for trivial offences, and sentences could be extended.|$|R
50|$|The three {{terminal}} stations at Dundee {{were retained}} {{for the time}} being, the <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> at the former NBR Tay Bridge station deterring the obvious rationalisation. The decline in local passenger use was a greater factor, and Dundee West station was closed on 3 May 1965.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} offered comfortable, if <b>cramped,</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{and luxury}} touches {{such as a}} rosewood-veneer dashboard and auto-seeking radio tuner. Road & Track was impressed, considering the interior suited to a [...] "luxurious GT" [...] and calling the 2000GT an impressive car [...] "in which to sit or ride - or simply admire." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Drake and {{the gentlemen}} with him took up their abode {{in the town}} until there should be need {{for them to go}} on board the Active, where the <b>accommodation</b> was much <b>cramped,</b> and life by no means agreeable; and the Vickars {{therefore}} escaped sharing the sufferings of those on board ship.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 24, {{he married}} Mary Ann Staples and {{they set up a}} dairy shop {{together}} at 173 Drury Lane, Holborn. The couple had probably saved a few pounds with which to buy shop equipment but their circumstances were extremely modest. They shared the <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> above the little shop with three other families.|$|R
5000|$|The UK Type 42s are {{succeeded by}} six Type 45 destroyers. , , , , [...] and [...] {{are all in}} commission. The Type 42 class {{suffered}} from <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation,</b> a problem for crew safety and comfort, and also when finding space for upgrades. The Type 45s are considerably larger, displacing 7,500 tonnes, compared to the Type 42 displacement of 3,600 tonnes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} techniques employed in their construction have improved over time: the boats have become faster, more seaworthy, and of higher capacity than earlier models. An [...] long narco-submarine can reach speeds of 18 km/h and carry up to 10 tons of cocaine. They are typically made of fiberglass, {{powered by a}} 225-260 kW diesel engine and manned by a crew of four. They have enough cargo space to carry two to ten tons of cocaine, carry large fuel tanks which give them a range of 3200 km, and are equipped with satellite navigation systems. There is no head (toilet), and <b>accommodation</b> is <b>cramped.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1924 {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} Imperial Institute {{building}} (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s {{to make way for}} Imperial College) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the <b>accommodation</b> itself proved <b>cramped</b> and inadequate and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.|$|R
50|$|Having a {{large family}} and being a very wealthy man, he found the castle <b>accommodation</b> {{extremely}} <b>cramped.</b> He broke with the tradition {{of his family and}} decided to make Sheffield his home, living in the castle built by Lord Furnivall. This castle is best known for later holding Mary, Queen of Scots, prisoner and indeed it was the 6th Earl, the Earl's grandson, who confined her. In 1516, he decided to build himself a country mansion on a hill about two miles away. In 1520, he had a chapel added to the parish church at Sheffield to serve as a family chapel with a burial vault below. This is now known as the Shrewsbury Chapel and now forms a historic part of Sheffield Cathedral.|$|R
500|$|Minor raids {{against other}} {{communities}} convinced Governor Joseph Dudley to send 20 men to garrison Deerfield in February. [...] These men, minimally trained militia from other nearby communities, had arrived by the 24th, making for somewhat <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodations</b> within the town's palisade {{on the night}} of February 28. [...] In addition to these men, the townspeople mustered about 70 men of fighting age; these forces were all under the command of Captain Jonathan Wells.|$|R
50|$|The <b>accommodation</b> {{was very}} <b>cramped</b> and full, {{and the engine}} now drew 17 wagons from the siding to make space, and then {{propelled}} them forward on the up line and partly through the crossover towards the down line so that {{the rear of the}} movement would clear the up line siding points. It was the intention to move the last (southernmost) wagon by hand into the up siding. At this moment the down express passenger train approached and struck the middle wagons of the seventeen being propelled.|$|R
500|$|After X1 was {{commissioned}} in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 {{she made a}} voyage to Gibraltar after which her main engine drive wheels {{were found to be}} damaged. After repairs she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea. Her starboard camshaft driveshaft broke during a full-power run in January 1928 and a new set of gears was needed, but after refitting at Malta her port camshaft driveshaft broke in the same place in April 1928. By 1930 her commanding officer reported [...] "internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, <b>accommodation</b> is <b>cramped,</b> ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good." [...] Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up. X1 was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at Pembroke on 12 December 1936.|$|R
25|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} {{deck chair}} on Morecambe Pier, Look Back in Anger was a {{strongly}} autobiographical piece based on Osborne's unhappy marriage to actress Pamela Lane and their life in <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> in Derby. While Osborne aspired towards a career in theatre, Lane was more practical and materialistic, not taking Osborne's ambitions seriously while cuckolding him with a local dentist. It also draws from Osborne's earlier life; for example, the wrenching speech of witnessing a loved one's death was a replay {{of the death of}} his father, Thomas.|$|R
50|$|The Carol {{was perhaps}} overengineered: {{it had a}} very strong {{monocoque}} body, a four-cylinder four-stroke engine with a five-bearing crankshaft and four-wheel independent suspension by torsion bars, but this led to high production costs, comparably high weight, and its very comfortable ride was offset by <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Nonetheless, the Carol was an incredible success in the marketplace, capturing 67% of the Kei market in its first year. A better equipped DeLuxe version was added in May 1962, along with a changed angle of the rear window to help it stay clean. In September 1963, shortly after a reshaped combustion head and upgrade to , a four-door version appeared.|$|R
5000|$|What Car? {{published}} a comparison {{test of the}} Lancia Trevi in March 1982. The Trevi 2000 was tested against the Citroën CX Reflex 2 litre and the Saab 900 GL 2.0 litre. The Trevi came last. The case against {{it was that the}} Trevi [...] "has less to recommend it the CX and 900. It is a reasonably good performer and moderately enjoyable to drive" [...] but the few positive aspects of its design were outweighed by various demerits. The Trevi [...] "fails to arouse enthusiasm the way a good Italian car should, and its ungainly rear end and <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> were further drawbacks." ...|$|R
2500|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} {{deck chair}} on Morecambe pier where Osborne was {{performing}} in a creaky rep show called Seagulls over Sorrento, Look Back in Anger was largely autobiographical, based on his time living, and arguing, with Pamela Lane in <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> in Derby while she cuckolded him with a local dentist. It was submitted to agents all over London and returned with great rapidity. In his autobiography, Osborne writes: [...] "The {{speed with which it}} had been returned was not surprising, but its aggressive dispatch did give me a kind of relief. It was like being grasped at the upper arm by a testy policeman and told to move on". Finally it was sent to the newly formed English Stage Company at London's Royal Court Theatre.|$|R
50|$|The main {{defensive}} weapon was a Caproni-Lanciani rotating dorsal turret, {{armed with a}} Scotti 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine gun with 350 rounds. This weapon was theoretically more powerful and lighter than the Breda-SAFAT, but reliability was a concern, and projectile dispersion was so wide as to reduce the theoretical range of 400 m (1,310 ft) to around 200 m (660 ft) in practice. Additional 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns were mounted in each side and in the bombardier's gondola, with four 215-round magazines each. The gondola's machine gun was of little use given the <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and was often not fitted, even in the SM.82 equipped for the bombing role. German machine-guns {{were used in the}} Luftwaffe versions, with the 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 in the turret. 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s were used in some aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The SAM was {{suspended}} during World War II (1939-45). {{and did not}} resume until 1948. Reconstruction and redevelopment of old buildings were important post-war themes, as were {{the search for a}} hygienic and comfortable lifestyle and exploration of new materials such as metal or plastic. The wide availability of gas and electricity inspired new appliances including vacuum cleaners, pressure cookers, irons, washing machines, heaters, refrigerators and hairdryers.However, many of the visitors in the first decade after the war were living in old, <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodations,</b> often without running water, gas or electricity.They preferred to delay purchase of major appliances until they could move into a more modern house or apartment. They visited the Salon to learn what was available and to decide on what would be most important. A gas water heater above the sink could be a more practical aspiration than a washing machine.|$|R
2500|$|The Dominicans came to Tallaght in 1855/6 {{and soon}} {{established}} a thriving priory {{that was also}} a seminary {{for the formation of}} Dominicans in Ireland and on missions in Trinidad and Tobago, South America, Australia, India, and elsewhere. The <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> of Tallaght house was replaced by the austere priory in phases of 1864, 1903 and again in 1957. [...] All are bleak, and remain so, but the work that goes on in these buildings is various and dedicated: [...] St Joseph's retreat house, the Tallaght parish, St Catherine's counselling centre, at least two publishing enterprises, individual writing and international research in several domains. Most recently Tallaght Priory has seen the birth of an institute for distance learning, started in 2000 but adapting well to new challenges and the possibility of outreach to a generation awake to the possibilities offered by the internet. This is validated through the Institute for Technology, Tallaght, the priory's closest neighbours.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the {{director}} of the children's foster home, Elisabeth Schleuß and the chairman Hugo Poppe behaved restrained towards the prevailing political convictions, and that was noticeable in terms of the children's education. The attitude was reflected in {{the fact that there was}} no portraits of Hitler in the whole house. Furthermore, ideological ideas or songs which glorified the national consciousness or the fighting spirit of the army were not spread at any time in the children's home. In 1943 the imperial governor (Nazi Gauleiter) Karl Kaufmann arranged a confiscation of the main building so that the children's hospital of Rothenburgsort, which had been bombed and destroyed could be moved into the building of the children's foster home and the Pestalozzi children had to move out of their house. The children's home was saved from closing and could continue its work only under considerable restrictions with twenty out of forty children who were housed in the <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodations</b> of the adjoining building.|$|R

50|$|The {{house built}} for the Macarthurs in 1793 was a '...very {{excellent}} brick building 68 ft in length, and 18 ft wide…' The four roomed hut faced north, overlooking the river. <b>Accommodation</b> was <b>cramped</b> and, without verandahs, offered little protection from Parramatta's fierce summer heat. To the rear was a freestanding kitchen and accommodation for convict servants. In coming decades, the cottage was enlarged and updated, taking on {{the form of a}} Regency Bungalow, set within well planted 'pleasure' grounds. Influenced by fashions from India, the Macarthurs added a broad overhanging roof, deep shady verandahs, tall glazed doors and full length shutters. Inside, improvements were made to joinery, fireplaces, furnishings and finishes. Much of the inspiration for these works came from Macarthur himself, with the likely assistance of architects Henry Kitchen, Henry Cooper and John Verge. By the early 1830s, Macarthur's health was failing, along with his grasp on politics, business and family affairs. As construction continued on the family's grander estate at Camden, the long-awaited additions to Elizabeth Farm were put on hold, including a detached 2-storey wing of bedrooms. Even his handsome library, though newly plastered, was left unpainted and without joinery until after his death in 1834. During the next few decades, under the direction of Elizabeth, only the most basic repairs and alterations were carried out. Apart from changes to paint schemes and improvements to the kitchen and servants quarters in the mid-1840s, the homestead remained unchanged. John Macarthur's plans for a stylish Parramatta seat were left undone - his vision, tragically never more than a dream.|$|R
50|$|A {{major concern}} among the Nepalese {{officials}} in Qatar is {{the rise of}} deaths of Nepalese workers. Nepalese migrants building the infrastructure to host the 2022 World Cup have died {{at a rate of}} one every two days in 2014. According to Nepalese Ambassador Suryanath Mishra, Two-third of the deaths are caused by stress because they are cheated by employment agencies and his embassy receives about 20 complaints each day from Nepalese victims of such fraud and that about 10 Nepalese return to their home country each day from Qatar because of such scams. The International Trade Union Confederation estimated that the worker death toll could hit 4,000 (nine deaths were associated with the last two World Cups, in Brazil and South Africa) before the 2022 World Cup begins. Nepalese workers in Qatar are forced to work 10- to 14-hour work days, often in extreme heat, with four hours of sleep, and live in <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodations</b> with poor sanitation. Many have gone into debt just to get to Qatar and frequently have to work overtime to make ends meet. Some make only one-third of the money that they’re initially promised.|$|R
5000|$|Constantine Technical College was {{formally}} opened on 2 July 1930 by the future King Edward VIII, the Prince of Wales. Although {{not yet a}} university, Constantine was a further and higher education college from the onset. Students at Constantine could be as young as 15. Degree courses, published in the College's prospectus were validated by the University of London. Disciplines included metallurgy, engineering and chemistry. Five rooms were also reserved for an art department, until <b>cramped</b> <b>accommodation</b> forced the School of Art to split from its parent site for the 1950s.The 1960s were years of sweeping change - {{as well as political}} sting - for the still comparatively fledgling College. By {{the end of the decade}} the first two [...] "Teesside University" [...] campaigns had begun: the first, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second, from 1967 to 1972. Spates of enthusiasm were killed off on each occasion by the scepticism of then-Minister of Education, Anthony Crosland, and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper, respectively. The latter effectively shelved plans for the erection of any new institution in the United Kingdom, until the 1980s at least.|$|R
