5|$|On February 28, 1332, a fire {{broke out}} in the palace of the podestà, the leading {{magistrate}} of the city. This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure from the ground floor up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the roof. On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof.|$|E

5|$|Sauvignon blanc can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision {{is the amount of}} contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In {{the early years of the}} New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{resulted}} in Danish naval supremacy, which was upheld throughout the war. The Danish King Christian V {{was able to}} ship troops over to the Swedish side of the Sound, and on 29 June a force of 14,500 men landed at Råå, just south of Helsingborg in southernmost Sweden. Scania became the main battleground of the war, culminating with the bloody battles of Lund, Halmstad and Landskrona. Danish and Dutch naval forces were left free to raze Öland and the Swedish east coast <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Stockholm. The Swedish failure at Öland also prompted King Charles XI to order a commission to investigate the fiasco, {{but in the end}} no one was found responsible.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic {{history of the}} planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has {{been affected by the}} biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Villani's Cronica {{is divided}} into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally Biblical times to 1264. The second phase, in six books, covers the history from 1264 until his own time, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1346. Villani outlines the events in his Cronica, not by theme, but through year-to-year accounts; for this, he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. Villani's chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, with little interpretation; this often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, making most of his mistakes in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs). However, his description of such events as the Battle of Crécy in 1346 was fairly accurate according to historian Kelly De Vries. Both Bartlett and Green state that Villani's Cronica represented a departure from medieval chronicles in that a more modernistic approach was taken in describing events and statistics, yet still medieval in that Villani relied on divine providence to explain the outcome of events.|$|E
5|$|In 1300 or shortly after, Villani {{began working}} on the Cronica, which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally biblical times {{with the story of}} the Tower of Babel up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1346. He outlined the events in his Cronica in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his Cronica in the vernacular language rather than Latin, the language of the educated elite. His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).|$|E
5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were clogged with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Smith {{registered}} a save {{in every}} appearance from April 28 to June 25. On June 11, he saved his 16th consecutive game {{to break the}} major league record set by Doug Jones in 1988. He ran his streak to 19 games before finally blowing a save on June 28. (John Wetteland broke the record the next year by saving 24 straight). After keeping his ERA at 0.00 through {{the first two months}} of the season, he was selected to his seventh and final All-Star Game, thereby becoming only the fourth player to be an All-Star for four different teams (after Walker Cooper, George Kell and Goose Gossage). Smith did not fare well for the next month, pushing his ERA <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5.40. Regardless, the Angels held a double-digit lead in the division and seemed set for the postseason. Instead, California suffered one of the worst collapses in major league history, blowing the entire double-digit lead in less than six weeks. While {{the rest of the team}} was reeling, Smith reverted to his early-season form and pitched fantastically for the last two months, only blowing one save attempt in that span. He finished the season with 37 saves and a 3.47 ERA, which was more than a point higher than the league average.|$|E
5|$|Sharon renewed his division's {{attack that}} day, moving north from Serabaeum on a three brigade front, with Matt on the right, Erez in the center, and Reshef on the left. The advance spanned {{the entire area}} between the Suez Canal on {{the east and the}} Sweetwater Canal on the west. By dawn, both Touscan and Ain Ghasin were under attack. The 89th Battalion had {{concentrated}} all its forces at the Touscan strong point, where it was hard-pressed by superior Israeli armored and mechanized forces. Azmy reported the situation to Second Army headquarters, and requested permission to detonate a nearby bridge on the Sweetwater Canal and flood the area before the advancing Israelis. Khalil however issued strict orders not to do so, since the canal was a crucial source of drinking water to civilians <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Suez city. The situation was deteriorating for the paratroopers however, and Azmy soon had the bridge destroyed and broke down sections of nearby irrigation canals, flooding the entire area and submerging Israeli tanks up to their hulls in muddy water. This led to the paratroopers of Matt's brigade spearheading the advance in the center instead, while the armored brigades were forced to have their mechanized infantry push ahead on foot. The Touscan position remained under heavy air and artillery attack, and by midday it was surrounded. Losses due to death and injury left the battalion with some 120 paratroopers still able to fight.|$|E
