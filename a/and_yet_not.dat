The term, first coined by video game designer Tim Schafer, led to Naughty Dog altering Drake's appearance to have his shirt almost tucked in from the front, and half tucked in at the back, an inside joke Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells labeled a [...] "three-quarters-tuck." [...] The half-tuck {{was part of a}} larger effort to ensure Drake's design was asymmetrical. Tim Schafer commented [...] "It was all super next-gen, but the most next-gen thing about it to me was Drake's shirt.

Tom Doyle views [...] "the new wave-ish rockers" [...] like [...] "Spin It On" [...] as [...] "too smoothed out to be truly edgy" [...] and the two spoken-word tracks as [...] "weird – {{and not in a}} good way". Doyle considers that while Back to the Egg has its [...] "moments of inspiration", [...] "There was too much material , <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> enough of it to gel into a cohesive album." ...|$|E

500|$|At this point, Charles called another {{council of}} war {{to discuss the}} situation. It was {{resolved}} that it was crucial that Gloucester was still to be taken; if it was left in Parliamentarian hands, it would act as a break in lines of communication should the Royalists advance further east towards London. In addition, Charles's personal reputation had been sullied – travelling so far <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> taking Gloucester would impact on the respect and prestige accorded to him, about which he was [...] "notoriously sensitive". Based on reconnaissance, Charles's officers were confident that the garrison's food and ammunition would not last long; they argued that the city could be taken in less than 10 days, with Parliament lacking an effective army to relieve the city. If Essex's forces did not attack, the Royalists would take the city. If they did attack, they would be exhausted and, according to Royalist intelligence, far weaker than the Oxford army, allowing Charles to destroy Parliament's one remaining significant force.|$|E
500|$|The brief [...] "Sea Song" [...] of 1907 was {{an early}} attempt by Grainger to write [...] "beatless" [...] music. This work, {{initially}} set over 14 irregular bars and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time, was a forerunner of Grainger's free-music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: [...] "It seems to me absurd {{to live in an}} age of flying, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> be able to execute tonal glides and curves". The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. [...] "Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching [...] "free" [...] (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties... into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony." [...] In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works {{in the manner of a}} Bach oratorio, a Wagner opera or a Brahms symphony, but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the Saturn and PlayStation ports {{were mostly}} {{positive}} although some were mixed. Sam Hickman from the Sega Saturn Magazine {{commented that the}} game manages to be extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed. He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary enough to make you an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> so difficult as to impede your progress for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story would make a great movie or book, but not a game." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to his {{resemblance}} with Roxas, {{video game}} publications initially thought that Roxas {{would be one}} of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep when seeing one of Ventus' images. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications continued to discuss how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them, but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series, it is hard to find them as coincidences. When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of Birth by Sleep, sites thought that he would voice Ventus, as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles. The character's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the [...] "most original take on Kingdom Hearts" [...] and yet [...] "frustratingly traditional". Upon Ventus' introduction in Birth by Sleep, X-Play found the character to be very similar to Sora's due to his friendly attitude. Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus' character for his [...] "well-meaning" [...] <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> [...] "annoying" [...] personality. The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be [...] "rewarding" [...] and commented on the English voice acting. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. On the other hand, PALGN found the three characters unappealing, labelling Ventus as [...] "just a Roxas clone, but without his personality." [...] In contrast to 1UP's comments towards Ventus' actions in Cinderella's world, VanOrd commented that such interactions to be [...] "more bothersome than boisterous." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antistaer called Ventus a [...] "Roxas-clone", and did not understand why he was briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas. Additionally, Miur praised Jesse McCartney's work as Ventus' English voice actor that make his story mode more engaging to players.|$|E
