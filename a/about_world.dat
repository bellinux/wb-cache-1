50|$|The results {{claimed by}} Hume as {{consequences}} of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything <b>about</b> the <b>world.</b> Since they don't mean anything <b>about</b> the <b>world,</b> relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things {{can be used to}} prove other things for certain, but only things <b>about</b> the <b>world</b> can be used to prove other things <b>about</b> the <b>world.</b> But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and <b>about</b> the <b>world,</b> only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something <b>about</b> the <b>world</b> with certainty.|$|R

5|$|Even in {{the wake}} of major companies' refusal to support the project, Madsen and Andersen {{continued}} to research archives in England, Germany and Sweden. In 2005, however, German films <b>about</b> <b>World</b> War II started to become popular, and several German companies became interested in the idea for the film. It became a co-production between Denmark and Germany, with three companies—Nimbus Film, Wüste Film and Babelsberg Studio—producing it. Filming took place at the Babelsberg locations in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany, and large parts of the film were shot at locations in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague, Czech Republic. It received a €342,000 ($460,000) grant from the German Film Fund for its total budget of more than 45million Danish kroner (or $7.6million), making it the most expensive Danish film produced to that date.|$|E

Disney {{enrolled}} at McKinley High School and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures <b>about</b> <b>World</b> War I; he also took night courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the United States Army to fight against the Germans, but he was rejected for being too young. After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate, he joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after the armistice. He drew cartoons {{on the side of his}} ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper Stars and Stripes. Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919, where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist Ub Iwerks.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Eastwood {{directed}} {{two films}} <b>about</b> <b>World</b> War II's Battle of Iwo Jima. The first, Flags of Our Fathers, {{focused on the}} men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by Letters from Iwo Jima, which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers {{on the island and}} the letters they wrote home to family members. Letters from Iwo Jima was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for Letters from Iwo Jima. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. Letters from Iwo Jima won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E

40|$|Humans have a {{tendency}} to endorse teleological beliefs <b>about</b> the <b>world.</b> According to terror management theory, teleological or purposeful beliefs <b>about</b> the <b>world</b> help people cope with the awareness of mortality.

Three studies tested and supported the notion that teleological beliefs <b>about</b> the <b>world</b> serve a terror management function. In “Study 1 ”, experimentally elevated teleological beliefs reduced death-thought accessibility. In “Studies 2 and 3 ”, mortality salience increased teleological beliefs, even if this resulted in judgment errors. Alternative explanations were tested and did not account for the findings...|$|R
