After extracting TSRS temporal pulse and data analysis, we obtained a TSRS gain coefficient of 0. 28 +/- 0. 03 cm/GW for the KDP sample. Our improvements of measurement method include the following three aspects: First, the separation of TSRS irradiation (362. 2 nm) from Rayleigh irradiation (351. 15 nm) is realized by first-order diffraction of grating for TSRS and Rayleigh. Second, to improve the ratio of TSRS signal and noise light owing to spurious reflection of pump radiation, we remove noise light by using band-pass filter and <b>absorption</b> <b>traps.</b> Third, by analyzing the time delay between pump signal and noise signal, we demonstrates the valid TSRS temporal pulse can be extracted from the noise signal and {{used to calculate the}} TSRS gain coefficient of KDP...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} salinity and freezing stress singly and in combination {{on a range}} of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in foliar tissue of six Crataegus genotypes was examined. In general, increased stress reduced fluorescence values and <b>absorption,</b> <b>trapping</b> and electron transport energy fluxes per leaf reaction center and cross section, with decreased sigmoidicity of OJIP curves as a measure of the plastoquinone pool, reflecting decreased energy fluxes. Based on percentage reduction in a performance index from controls compared to stress-treated values, plants were ranked in order of tolerant > intermediate > sensitive. Use of this PIp ranking criteria enabled the distinguishing of marked differences in foliar salt/freezing hardiness between the Crataegus species used. Interpretation of the photochemical data showed that salinity and freezing affects both the acceptor and donor side of Photosystem II, while OJIP observations provided information regarding structural and functional changes in the leaf photosynthetic apparatus of the test species.

Consequently, {{the potential to}} decrease the cost of photovoltaic energy thanks to these structures is not negligible.

In this work, we have used a purely electrical approach called reverse recovery transient (RRT) to perform measurements of minority carrier lifetime in core-shell nanowire-based solar cells under dark conditions. The structures are based on crystalline silicon nanowires grown on silicon wafers and embedded in a radial amorphous silicon shell. The electrical contacts for this hetero-junction structure are transparent conductive oxide for the front surface and aluminum for the backside.
