25|$|Pamuk's {{international}} reputation {{continued to}} increase when he published Benim Adım Kırmızı (My Name is Red) in 1998. The novel blends mystery, romance, and philosophical puzzles in a setting of 16th century Istanbul. It opens <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat III in nine snowy winter days of 1591, inviting the reader to experience the tension between East and West from a breathlessly urgent perspective. My Name Is Red has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the International Dublin Literary Award, the world's most lucrative literary prize.|$|E
25|$|The Founding of Lesbos: twentyone hexameters were {{quoted by}} Parthenius {{under the title}} Lesbou ktisis. The author's name was not given but modern {{scholars}} attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Peisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning {{at the hands of}} the Argives. It can be argued that Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with Argonautica, epic material has been used unconventionally as <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> female psyche.|$|E
500|$|Behind the Mother-of-Pearl Throne is the Phra Banchon Busabok Mala Throne (พระบัญชรบุษบกมาลา; [...] ). This half throne {{protrudes}} {{from the southern}} wall of the throne hall and opens like <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall. The style of the throne is similar to Busabok Mala Throne on the porch outside. The throne was built {{during the reign of}} King Rama IV, in order for the palace women to attend important ceremonies through the window but behind a screen, separating them from men arriving from the outside.|$|E

500|$|The small Philadelphia {{panel is}} painted with oil on {{parchment}} (vellum); a reconstructed red vermilion border surrounds the image– it {{is similar to}} those seen in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. [...] It gives the illusion of the viewer looking through <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> landscape. The parchment measures the image measures [...] Underneath are five wood supports; the parchment is glued to one, and four smaller pieces, added at a later date, frame the image. The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in {{a thick layer of}} white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of gold leaf on the lower border. The Turin panel is painted on two oak panels joined with a band of parchment or cloth, on a ground of chalk and animal glue.|$|E
500|$|Marvel's {{announcement}} {{was met with}} widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of Muslimah Media Watch, a diversity advocacy group, told Al Jazeera America that [...] "She {{is going to be}} <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American Muslim experience" [...] and that she [...] "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim." [...] Brett White of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes." [...] Hussein Rashid writing for CNN said, [...] "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims. She is born in the United States, appears {{to be part of the}} post-9/11 generation and is a teenager." [...] Muaaz Khan of The Guardian compared Kamala Khan to Malala Yousafzai and indicated that the rest of entertainment industry should follow Marvel's example. However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the University of Liverpool felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially taqiyya: a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution. Political satirist Stephen Colbert joked about Marvel's decision to introduce a Muslim superhero on his television show. Comedian Conan O'Brien also made a joke via Twitter, linking the character's religion to polygamy, but later removed it due to public backlash.|$|E

Different scholars have variously interpreted them {{from the perspective of}} gender studies, history, sociology, and the anthropology of South Asia. The dress, the jewelry, the gender relations, the social activities depicted showcase at least a lifestyle of the royalty and elite, and in others definitely the costumes of the common man, monks and rishi depicted therein.

She said, [...] "There are no overproduced glamorous outings, no sound-track manipulated showdowns, no manufactured feuds — everyone in the pilot has the easy genial mien of friends helping out an odd but beloved neighbor. There's even a trio of local musicians providing a transitional tune", calling the result, [...] "occasionally weird, occasionally hilarious show that is simultaneously <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> life of an eccentric performer and a wickedly fun send-up of the genre, dating {{all the way to}} Paris Hilton and The Simple Life.

2500|$|World of Reptiles {{has been}} an {{attraction}} at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, as well as <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits {{a wide range of}} endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, false gharial, yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volcán Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, pancake tortoise, Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|E
