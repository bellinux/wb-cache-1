500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well take a good look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{the second}} act... I came on {{carrying}} a monkey... On opening night, the monkey went berserk... (he) snatched my black wig from my head, leaped from {{my arms and}} scampered down to the footlights. There he paused, peered out at the audience, then waved my wig over his head... The audience had been giggling at the absurd plot even before this simian had <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Now</b> it became hysterical. What did Tallulah do in this crisis? I turned a cartwheel! The audience roared... After the monkey business I was afraid they might boo me. Instead I received an ovation." ...|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> seriously <b>now,</b> a cold glitter in {{his small}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Gee! I felt {{just like}} that myself. All day the country had been tugging <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>now</b> it tugged worse than ever.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed to}} muse awhile, holding his lip in his hand, and looking <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and <b>now</b> upon the {{causeway}} of the street.|$|R
2500|$|... "First, I {{want to let}} {{you know}} that I came to join the revolution, not to kill the Cambodian people. Look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> Do you think ... am I a violent person? No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was looking}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> with those great eyes of hers, very wide and round.|$|E
6000|$|He looked round <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> {{as if in}} {{recognition}} of my understanding him; then ever so gently, [...] "To let me alone," [...] he replied.|$|E
60|$|We resumed our walk. Again we were {{nearing the}} inn. Lady Delahaye looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> every <b>now</b> and then curiously. My feeling towards her had grown {{more and more}} belligerent.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you laugh}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again! <b>Now</b> tell <b>me,</b> Mr. Coningsby, {{what do you}} think we shall do to-night? I look upon you, you know, as the real arbiter of our destinies.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Recalling {{her eyes}} from the distance, she looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again <b>now,</b> with her former air. Mr. Littimer, {{clearing}} his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough, changed legs, and went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she began, softly, hurriedly. [...] "My word is not lightly given. Let it prove {{my faith}} in you. Look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> and say you will come." ...|$|E
60|$|Unpleasant news {{always made}} the Emperor furious {{against the man}} who broke it. He railed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> in the rasping, croaking, Corsican voice which only made itself heard when {{he had lost his}} self-control.|$|E
6000|$|... "The manageress had sat {{all this}} while busy with her papers {{without a word}} to either of us, but she glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> with so much {{annoyance}} upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not afraid," [...] Mrs. Crayford replied. [...] "He frightened <b>me</b> <b>at</b> first--he {{interests}} <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> Let {{him speak}} to me if he wishes it!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{is an old}} woman; {{her eyes}} are dim. At times, she can look mischievous. She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> mischievously <b>now.</b> I wished I {{had not been so}} eager to have Mr. Dunboyne asked to dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to see}} him. When {{they were}} all ranting and raving <b>at</b> <b>me</b> just <b>now</b> I wished he was there--I told them so. But now I don't feel like that--I can never see him again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How strange," [...] {{said little}} Pierre, [...] "I think {{it begins to}} look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> aunt. Hark! aunt, it's so silent all round in this old-fashioned room, that I think I hear a little {{jingling}} in the picture, as if the watch-seal was striking against the key--Hark! aunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you Puritan!" [...] she cried. [...] "To {{think that}} I should have married a Puritan! What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who {{was such a}} stanch Royalist? Why, I think I can see him {{frowning}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but {{you think}} I kept Bonita up in the mountains, that I went {{secretly}} to meet her, that all the while I served you I was--Oh, I know what you think! I know now. I never knew till I made you look <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Now,</b> say it! Speak!" ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Yes, I {{used to like}} once to see all {{the faces}} looking up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> But <b>now</b> all that is gone from <b>me.</b> <b>Now</b> I think it is enough to be a witness for the truth, and to think the {{thoughts}} I like. God will bring the people to me. He will make of my silence a great wind that will shatter the ships of the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{something}} to say to Mr. Roylake," [...] he announced, with a haughty look at his landlord. [...] "Mind! I don't forget your screaming <b>at</b> <b>me</b> just <b>now,</b> and I intend to know what you meant by it. That will do. Get out of the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean your}} Bishop." [...] Venters said it {{deliberately}} {{and would not}} release her as she started back. [...] "He's the law. The edict went forth to ruin <b>me.</b> Well, look <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> It'll <b>now</b> go forth to compel you {{to the will of}} the Church." ...|$|R
6000|$|If he had {{not looked}} at me before, he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> {{in three or four}} quick {{successive}} glances. [...] "I beg your pardon, sir," [...] he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence, [...] "but you did me the honour to mention the young lady's name--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You wouldn't believe it, {{that you}} wouldn't,' replied his mother, 'but don't {{say a word}} to him, for I really don't believe he's human. Hush! Don't turn round as if I was talking of him, but he's a squinting <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> in the full blaze of the coach-lamp, quite awful!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am {{so stupid}} and so slow," [...] he said naïvely. [...] "Why! look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> My heart is simply {{bursting}} {{with all that}} I {{want to say to}} you, but I just can't find the words, and I do nothing but talk rubbish and feel how you must despise me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what made}} it hardest was Seth jeering <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'You can't shake her that way,' he said. 'You saved her life--' 'I didn't,' I said sharply; 'it was you.' 'But she thinks you did, {{which is the same}} thing,' he came back <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'And <b>now</b> she belongs to you. Custom of the country, as you ought to know.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did find}} out, when I {{came to you}} at the mine, that I had forged against you the name of Micheltorena. I to the lawyer went, {{and found that it}} was so--of a verity--so! so! all the time. Look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> not <b>now,</b> Don Royal;--it is a 'forgaire' you stare at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone crazy," [...] {{began the}} Captain's voice {{suddenly}} in the tube. [...] "Rushed <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] . Just <b>now.</b> Had to knock him down. [...] . This minute. You heard, Mr. Rout?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Aaron continued, still {{turning the}} handle, [...] "You're truthful, and you canna deny it. Nor will you deny that I shamed you {{and every other}} mother's son that night. You try to hod it out o' pity, smith, but even as you look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> does the man in you no rise up against me?" ...|$|E
60|$|I let {{him take}} me to a {{restaurant}} of his choice, but on the way I bought a paper. When we had ordered our dinner, I propped it against a bottle of St. Galmier and began to read. We ate in silence. I felt him looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now</b> and again, but I took no notice. I meant {{to force him to}} conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've run the {{gauntlet}} over there once too often," [...] Horridge said grimly. [...] "Just look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>now,</b> Sir Henry. I'm twenty-nine years old, and it's {{only two years}} and a half since I was invalided out of the navy and took this job on. The last person I asked to guess my age put me down at fifty. What should you have said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On my {{way home}} that night my hansom knocked down an old man. He was not seriously hurt, and I drove him home. On the way he stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> curiously. Every <b>now</b> and then he laughed--unpleasantly.|$|R
5000|$|Fabian {{was one of}} the few {{to benefit}} from the program, which have a new respect for his acting. [...] "This whole town looks <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{differently}} <b>now</b> - I can feel it," [...] he said. [...] "It's a funny thing, though about that show. I think if it had been one of Hitchcock's TV shows and with no big name in it, nobody would have heard of it." ...|$|R
