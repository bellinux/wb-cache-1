5|$|A typical day-to-day {{traditional}} {{vegetarian meal}} of Uttar Pradesh, {{like any other}} North Indian thali, consists of roti (flatbread), chawal, dal, sabji, raita and papad. Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter milk) with meals. On festive occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried foods are consumed. A typical festive thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad, raita, salad <b>and</b> <b>desserts</b> (such as sewai or Kheer).|$|E

The book {{was published in the}} United States on May 1, 2002, by Chronicle Books, and in a French language edition in 2004 by Les Éditions de l'Homme in Montreal. In it, Perry describes her original concept of recipes combining sugar and bacon. Her book includes recipes for bacon-flavored dishes <b>and</b> <b>desserts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The BK Whopper Bar {{is limited}} service concept created by Burger King in 2009. Whopper Bars are smaller footprint, {{specialized}} stores with a menu {{limited to the}} company's Whopper, crispy chicken sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich sandwiches; drinks; <b>and</b> <b>desserts.</b> The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. The concept {{is similar to the}} McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into airports, casinos, and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E
5|$|The menu {{is created}} by Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice, <b>and</b> <b>desserts</b> include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E

5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, <b>and</b> <b>desserts,</b> cakes and drinks.|$|E
5|$|When the {{predecessor}} of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, <b>and</b> <b>desserts.</b> After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu {{by adding the}} Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded {{both inside and outside}} the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.|$|E

Two commercially available Botrytis lateral-flow devices (immunochromatographic devices) were tested and compared for their ability to detect and quantify levels of a highly stable Botrytis antigen in table wines <b>and</b> <b>dessert</b> wines. Table wines were diluted 1 : 40 <b>and</b> <b>dessert</b> wines 1 : 500 in phosphate buffered saline plus Tween 20 (0. 05 % v/v). Results from both types of devices were comparable and repeatability was good. This study shows that Botrytis lateral-flow devices could provide a useful tool for winemakers interested in relating levels of Botrytis antigens in table <b>and</b> <b>dessert</b> wines to sensory properties. This research was supported by a Senior Fellowship award to Prof Chris Steel from the British Society of Plant Pathology...|$|R
