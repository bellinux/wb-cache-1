5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and <b>alternative</b> <b>products.</b> However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{asbestos}} in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in many developed countries or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues {{to be used in}} construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban would cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in a 13-year timeframe, and that the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of <b>alternative</b> <b>products.</b> Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of Artex, a decorative stipple finish, however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.|$|E
500|$|The {{new models}} omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt {{adapters}} for both interfaces. They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive. Instead {{of a hard}} disk drive, the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5" [...] notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans. The new case design {{does not have a}} Kensington lock slot, so <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> are required to physically secure the computer.|$|E

2500|$|The Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants {{considers}} {{the use of}} lindane in agriculture as largely redundant, with other, less toxic and less persistent pesticides. [...] In the case of pharmaceutical use, the committee noted, [...] "alternatives for pharmaceutical uses have often failed for scabies and lice treatment {{and the number of}} available <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> for this use is scarce. For this particular case, a reasonable alternative would be to use lindane as a second-line treatment when other treatments fail, while potential new treatments are assessed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also {{inspired}} by Josef Steindl’s analysis, Ernest Mandel argued that if corporations monopolizing product markets can evade price competition {{to a considerable}} extent, they can also evade the general tendency for differences in profit rates to level out (in the direction of an average rate). Even if monopoly profit rates fell, they would usually remain higher than the profit rates of small and medium-sized firms. Sure, the monopolists could raise their prices only within certain limits, beyond which they would attract competitors (including other monopolists) able to supply <b>alternative</b> <b>products</b> at a lower price. Nevertheless, in reality, there existed not one, but two kinds of [...] "average profit rates" [...] in capitalist production: a higher one for corporations in the monopolized sectors of product markets, and a lower one for smaller firms in the non-monopolized sectors.|$|E
