500|$|In {{the first}} season of Desperate Housewives, the {{character}} of Susan was a critics' favorite and generally regarded as the series' most prominent role. Hatcher's portrayal as Susan received praise in the series' first year. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle called Hatcher's performance in the pilot episode [...] "a huge surprise," [...] commenting that she gives [...] "self-effacing, disheveled <b>and</b> <b>sadly</b> hopeless Susan a spirit that makes you root for her". Robert Bianco of USA Today declared that Hatcher delivered [...] "a revelatory performance". Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com was less enthusiastic, criticizing Hatcher for overacting. In the series' second season, Susan becomes less important as Bree [...] "comfortably moves into position as the show's lead". Many critics noted that the character suffered {{as a result of}} the declining quality of the second season. Bianco wrote that the writers were making Susan [...] "too stupid". Hatcher continued to provide comic relief in the third season.|$|E

[...] The elder doctor has less time for a nurse, Carrie Middleton, who has worked at his hospital for thirty years and once dated him, but who is involved in a labor protest—Denby orders her fired at the request of Lansdale, an influential trustee and soap manufacturer.

500|$|Polenberg {{describes}} Cardozo's lifelong {{devotion to}} {{his older sister}} Nell, with whom he lived in New York until her death in 1929. When asked why he had never married, Cardozo replied, quietly <b>and</b> <b>sadly,</b> [...] "I never could give Nellie the second place in my life." [...] Polenberg suggests that friends may have stressed Cardozo's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors [...] "that he was sexually dysfunctional, or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual." [...] But he produces {{no evidence to support}} any of these possibilities, except to note that friends, in describing Cardozo, used words like [...] "beautiful", [...] "exquisite", [...] "sensitive" [...] or [...] "delicate." [...] Andrew Kaufman, author of Cardozo, a biography published in 2000, notes that [...] "Although one cannot be absolutely certain, it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life". Judge Learned Hand is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo: [...] "He [...] no trace of homosexuality anyway".|$|E
500|$|Brian Tallerico of UGO {{gave the}} episode a mixed review (a C), expressing {{disappointment}} after the well received The Simpsons Movie. He felt the writers went [...] "right {{back to their}} old clichés <b>and</b> <b>sadly</b> repetitive jokes". He did praise the altered opening sequence. Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode 5/10, praising the opening sequence but found most of the episode mediocre, especially Stephen Colbert's appearance. Nonetheless, [...] "even a mediocre episode will have a few comic gems hidden inside. The time spent in Chicago is quite enjoyable, including a great Ferris Bueller sight gag, and life coach Colby delivers a zinger of a line comparing Homer's attitude {{to that of the}} United States of America." [...] Richard Keller of TV Squad praised the episode, saying [...] "after watching so many recent ones where Homer seemed like a barely functioning mental patient, I wasn't used to a Homer that was actually fairly normal." [...] Al Jean, the current executive producer of The Simpsons, has called the episode one of his personal favorites. Prefix Mag's Andrew Martin named Lionel Richie his ninth favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Vandernoot {{wanted to}} leave the show because {{shooting}} Highlander was too demanding and required her to spend several months each year in Canada. Vandernoot also wanted {{to spend more time}} with her family. According to Abramowitz, a further, artistic, reason was that [...] "...a small part of [...] being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show <b>and</b> <b>sadly,</b> the nature of the beast was that it couldn't happen and she made a decision." [...] Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to [...] "...have the women be something other than a victim, a hostage, other things when [...] dealing with an immortal hero." [...] Consequently, the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but [...] were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said that, [...] "There was no way... to have a scene where she said, 'Okay, I'm going to go to Paris without you. Nice knowing you, MacLeod.'" [...] The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die, despite Abramowitz's feeling that her death was [...] "...sad" [...] and [...] "...heartbreaking".|$|E

Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, <b>and</b> <b>sadly</b> notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap.

[...] After only three months, he left 428 Bomber Squadron (RCAF) as an acting group captain on 7 Feb 1943, when he was assigned as the station commander of RAF Ridgewell and then RAF West Wickham, late in 1943, then as a temporary group captain.

2500|$|Not {{long after}} the cave was discovered, early explorers found the body of an {{indigenous}} man within. Although his origins are unclear, {{it was believed that}} he had entered the cave after becoming injured, making his way to a rock ledge where he died, [...] "in the position of one asleep". Woods related one theory of how he arrived at that position, describing how a group of settlers formed a party to avenge the death of the sheep and the killing of one of their number. The party shot many of the indigenous people living in the region, one of whom, Woods surmises, was fatally wounded but managed to make his way into the cave to hide, <b>and,</b> <b>sadly,</b> to die. Variations of this account described how the man was shot near Hynam, or placed his shooting much nearer to the cave itself. However, this account of his death fails to address the state of the body: Woods described it as being [...] "dried and shriveled", only slightly decayed, and stated that it had been there for many years without decomposition. In addition, the man appears to have died under an active flowstone, which caused parts of his body to become covered in limestone, leading Woods to describe him as being in an [...] "almost petrified" [...] state. It is suggested that both processes would take many years, placing his death some time prior to 1845.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website {{announced}} the Nook Study {{had been replaced}} by Yuzu, which the company called [...] "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."

[...] Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: [...] "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for." [...] Clicking [...] "Get NookStudy Help" [...] redirects one to the [...] "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app as well as find answers to frequently asked questions. [...] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, [...] "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials" [...] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight, where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class. Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: [...] "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy" [...] and [...] "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".
