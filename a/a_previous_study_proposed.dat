The binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain of GC-C (ECDGC-C) triggers signal transduction, resulting in the regulation of intestinal fluids and electrolytes. <b>A</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> <b>proposed</b> that a ligand-binding site on GC-C is localized near the transmembrane region.

The micro domain showed ligand-binding activity (IC 50 = 1 × 10 − 8 M). This result clearly indicates that a ligand-binding site is located {{in close proximity to}} the membrane-bound region, and that the micro domain is capable of independently binding the ligand, without assistance from other domains.

Until recently, it {{has been difficult to}} predict whether cooperation can evolve at a network (population) level. To address this problem, <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> <b>proposed</b> a numerical metric, called Average Gradient of Selection (AGoS). AGoS can characterize and forecast the evolutionary fate of cooperation at a population level. However, stochastic mutation of strategies was not considered in the analysis of AGoS.

We show that our extended AGoS correctly predicts the final states of cooperation with mutation in the individual-based simulations. Our analyses revealed that mutation always has a negative effect on the evolution of cooperation regardless of the payoff functions, fraction of cooperators, and network structures. Moreover, we found that scale-free networks are most vulnerable to mutation and thus the dynamics of cooperation is altered from bistability to coexistence on those networks, undergoing an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation.

Contrary to expectations, all yellow individuals that stayed on the reefs changed to brown, regardless of the model species. No brown individuals changed to the yellow colouration.

The proposed system has three objective functions, which are: evacuation distance, evacuation time and safety of evacuation route. Also, we proposed a new safety evaluation method. As a result, this study gives a better reflection of the change of road conditions. Also, the safety evaluation values are more useful than the previous study's evaluation method of the route.

40|$|The Outer Hebrides Fault Zone {{is a major}} ESE-dipping {{detachment}} exposed within basement gneisses of the Archaean- Palaeoproterozoic Lewisian Complex, northwest Scotland. The {{fault zone}} exhibits a long-lived displacement history and was active during Proterozoic, end-Silurian, Carboniferous and Mesozoic times. The earliest deformation event preserved onshore was associated with top-to-the-NW ductile thrusting. <b>A</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> <b>proposed</b> that thrust-related protomylonitic and mylonitic fabrics are cross-cut by amphibolites ('Younger Basics') and Laxfordian granite and pegmatite sheets. This evidence was used to suggest that ductile thrusting occurred during the Palaeoproterozoic Inverian event at c. 2500 Ma. Our observations demonstrate, however, that mylonitic fabrics within the ductile thrust zone are superimposed on all components of the gneiss complex including amphibolites and Laxfordian intrusions. It therefore follows that the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone cannot be older than c. 1685 Ma, the age of recently dated Laxfordian granites in the Outer Hebrides. Geochronological {{studies have shown that}} the basement blocks of the northern Outer Hebrides and Scottish mainland have different geological histories and were amalgamated during Proterozoic times at or after c. 1700 Ma. We propose that early ductile thrusting along the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone formed part of this amalgamation process leading to burial and reheating of the footwall gneisses in Lewis and north Harris. This would account for the c. 1100 Ma thermal event recorded by previous workers and implies that ductile thrusting along the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone is of Grenvillian age. ...|$|E
40|$|The acid-sensitive ion {{channels}} (ASICs) are {{a family}} of voltage-insensitive sodium channels activated by external protons. <b>A</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> <b>proposed</b> that the mechanism underlying activation of ASIC consists of the removal of a Ca 2 + ion from the channel pore (Immke and McCleskey, 2003). In this work we have revisited this issue by examining single channel recordings of ASIC 1 from toadfish (fASIC 1). We demonstrate that increases in the concentration of external protons or decreases in the concentration of external Ca 2 + activate fASIC 1 by progressively opening more channels and by increasing the rate of channel opening. Both maneuvers produced similar effects in channel kinetics, consistent with the former notion that protons displace a Ca 2 + ion from a high-affinity binding site. However, {{we did not observe}} any of the predictions expected from the release of an open-channel blocker: decrease in the amplitude of the unitary currents, shortening of the mean open time, or a constant delay for the first opening when the concentration of external Ca 2 + was decreased. Together, the results favor changes in allosteric conformations rather than unblocking of the pore as the mechanism gating fASIC 1. At high concentrations, Ca 2 + has an additional effect that consists of voltage-dependent decrease in the amplitude of unitary currents (EC 50 of 10 mM at − 60 mV and pH 6. 0). This phenomenon is consistent with voltage-dependent block of the pore but it occurs at concentrations much higher than those required for gating...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} work is to propose a new micromechanical method {{in the context of}} the {{deductive}} approach used to derive the interface models. This model, based on <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> <b>proposed</b> by A. Rekik and F.

The focal point of this method is assuming the existence of a third material, called interphase, which is a mixture of the two principal constituents of masonry, brick and mortar, and that is the interface between them. This new element presents a low thickness, a low stiffness and a given damage ratio. The mechanical problem of masonry, initially a 3 D problem, is solved numerically as a 2 D problem using finite element methods and considering three materials: brick, mortar and the defined interface material. The properties of the last material are obtained using the three following steps: (I) an exact homogenisation of a brick/mortar laminates defining a first homogeneous equivalent medium named HEM- 1. (II) One assumes that HEM- 1 is damaged and applies the Welemane-Goidescu [3 - 5] model to evaluate the global behaviour of the damaged HEM- 1 defining thus a second equivalent homogeneous medium noted HEM- 2. (III) Asymptotic analysis is used to model HEM- 2 as an interface or a joint. The properties of this joint are deduced from those of the HEM- 2 material as proposed in former papers [6 - 9]. Particularly, through the second homogenization is taken into ac-count for variable oriented family of microcracks and simultaneously for opening-closure effects (unilateral behaviour). Numerically this interface is modelled with connector finite elements. Numerical results are compared to experimental ones available in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (Hsps), amongst them, Hsp 70 and Hsp 90 families, serve {{mainly as}} facilitators of protein folding (molecular chaperones) of the cell. The Hsp 70 family of proteins {{represents one of}} the most important molecular chaperones in the cell. Plasmodium falciparum, the main agent of malaria, expresses six Hsp 70 isoforms. Two (PfHsp 70 - 1 and PfHsp 70 -z) of these localize to the parasite cytosol. PHsp 70 - 1 is known to occur in a functional complex with another chaperone, PfHsp 90 via a co-chaperone, P. falciparum Hsp 70 -Hsp 90 organising protein (PfHop). (−) -Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) is a green tea constituent that is thought to possess antiplasmodial activity. However, the mechanism by which EGCG exhibits antiplasmodial activity is not fully understood. <b>A</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> <b>proposed</b> that EGCG binds to the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp 70. In the current study, we overexpressed and purified recombinant forms of two P. falciparum cytosol localized Hsp 70 s (PfHsp 70 - 1 and PfHsp 70 -z), and PfHop, a co-chaperone of PfHsp 70 - 1. Using the surface plasmon resonance approach, we demonstrated that EGCG directly binds to the two Hsp 70 s. We further observed that binding of EGCG to the two proteins resulted in secondary and tertiary conformational changes. In addition, EGCG inhibited the ATPase and chaperone function of the two proteins. Furthermore, EGCG abrogated association of the two Hsp 70 s with their functional partners. Using parasites cultured in vitro at the blood stages, we observed that 2. 9 µM EGCG suppressed 50 % P. falciparum parasite growth (IC 50). Our findings demonstrate that EGCG directly binds to PfHsp 70 - 1 and PfHsp 70 -z to inhibit both the ATPase and chaperone functions of the proteins. Our study constitutes the first direct evidence suggesting that the antiplasmodial activity of EGCG is at least in part accounted for by its inhibition of Hsp 70 function...|$|E

Our work focuses on very dynamic high-speed environments where the available best-effort bandwidth for regulated traffics can vary over time. Foreseen problems introduced by such highly dynamic environments are inefficiency due to convergence time and high amount of packet losses due to dramatic reductions of the available bandwidth. In <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study,</b> we <b>proposed</b> the XCP-r protocol which is a more robust XCP-based transport protocol. In this paper, we present simulation results comparing XCP-r, XCP, TCP (NewReno) and HSTCP for large data transfers on very dynamic high-speed networks. We show that XCP-r succeeds in providing a high level of performance thus able to function in a broader range of network conditions. I...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of disability, being motor {{impairments}} its major consequence. Despite rehabilitation, more than 60 % of the patients report upper-limb motor dysfunction. The design of novel rehabilitation strategies requires objective measures to assess motor impairment and recovery. In <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study,</b> we <b>proposed</b> to use the synergy components of the unaffected limb as a reference to be targeted by rehabilitation, since they are proven to explain healthy motor control and to be altered after stroke. We demonstrated that healthy subjects have very similar control structures (synergies and activation vectors) in their right and left arms. Here, we investigate the existence of movement-specific control strategies. To do so, we analyze the inter-subject similarity of the healthy control structure in twelve common stroke rehabilitation exercises and we evidence that motor control is movement specific and generalizes across different subjects and their limbs. However, the similarity degree depends on the movement, suggesting that novel training protocols should purposely choose the rehabilitation exercises to ensure maximum control similarity with the reference pattern. 1...|$|R
