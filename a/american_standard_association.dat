5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} development in {{the early history of}} FORTRAN was the decision by the <b>American</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Association</b> (now <b>American</b> National <b>Standards</b> Institute (ANSI)) to form a committee sponsored by BEMA, the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, to develop an <b>American</b> <b>Standard</b> Fortran.

50|$|As a result, {{implementing}} an electromechanical keyboard {{that produced}} an ASCII encoding but had conventional typewriter key mappings would require significant complexity due to key-specific shift mechanisms for digits and symbol keys.

Later keyboards continued to use this mapping, which was formalized in the <b>American</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Association</b> X4.14-1971 <b>standard,</b> where it {{is referred to as}} logical bit pairing, and contrasted with typewriter pairing. In everyday usage these were referred to as bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards.|$|R

He emphasized doing work with direct economic impact and got money from the Works Progress Administration to hire unemployed mathematicians to develop math tables.

50|$|Text was {{encoded in}} several ways. The {{earliest}} standard character encoding was Baudot, which {{dates back to}} the nineteenth century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed), Western Union code, International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA 2), and American Teletypewriter code (USTTY), were used. Other standards, such as Teletypesetter (TTS), FIELDATA and Flexowriter, had six holes. In the early 1960s, the <b>American</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Association</b> led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as ASCII. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.|$|R
