500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.7 out of 10, praising the plot and the {{introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticizing the amount of humor and MCU references. David Sims of The A.V. Club scored the episode a 'B', calling it [...] "the first episode to show some potential for originality around the corner". He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating your boat so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much to change your mind. If you're not in the mood, the endless quipping can seem exhausting, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some incremental character development." [...] He had especial praise for the introduction of Hall/Graviton, and felt that Hart's performance as the character topped Samuel L. Jackson's cameo from the previous episode.|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
500|$|... "TS-19" [...] {{garnered}} favorable {{reviews from}} most television critics. In his 8.5 out of 10 rating review, Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode was an exceptional showing for the series, adding that it told [...] "a compelling, intense story within its hour" [...] albeit averting from the comics. As Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The first season of The Walking Dead doesn’t exactly end on an optimistic note, but our heroes are left driving into the unknown after escaping certain death at the CDC." [...] Kurt Christenson of New York Daily News analyzed that [...] "almost and everyone's still kind of in the dark", and Kelly stated that [...] "TS-19" [...] came to an [...] "abrupt, explosive end". Salon journalist Simon Abrams concluded that the frenetic pace of The Walking Dead was relatable, while Paste television commentator Josh Jackson was keen of the character development in the episode {{as well as the}} varying political themes covered; [...] "After six episodes, the characters are worth caring about. Despite occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes, the few living souls in The Walking Dead are a bigger draw than the undead. The show has spent more time on topics like marriage, parenthood, unfaithfulness, loss, domestic violence, gender roles, small-scale politics, loyalty, kindness than it has with kill shots. By filling the world with zombies, Frank Darabont is able to explore the human condition under extreme circumstances." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson was entertained by [...] "TS-19", and asserted that the conclusion [...] "resonated over images of Rick & Co. U-turning into the great unknown, we got the sense that {{as long as they were}} alive, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a chance of a tomorrow." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jeff Jensen was intrigued at how producers approached the themes of the comics, and later noted that it was proof that they were using the comics as a route for thematic inspiration in lieu of a literal interpretation. For Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre, [...] "Tonight's finale [...] did yield much insight, though, into the nature of the plague itself, in relative terms anyway." ...|$|E

[...] It proposes that the Yongbyon 5MW(e) nuclear reactor be [...] "suspended, shut down and sealed" [...] within two months in exchange for energy supplies and economic aid by the other five countries to North Korea. [...] It also proposed to establish [...] "four to six" [...] working groups {{on each of the}} outstanding issues not agreed on. [...] Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso was reported to applaud the draft, hailing it as a breakthrough.
