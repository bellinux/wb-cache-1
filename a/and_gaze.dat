5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who had {{remained}} at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a parade during the credits. In the end, Mario and Peach exit their parade float <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> up the sky, seeing fireworks. This part will not end until the player turns off the console. When restarted, the file will restart from the last save.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{abilities}} {{that have been}} investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension of pointing gestures <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror self-recognition, and Numerical values.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E

25|$|In his journals, Alexander Polovtsov, State Secretary during Alexander III's reign, left an unsympathetic {{portrayal}} of Grand Duchess Olga.

Just a sharp-tongued high-society lady without any other hobbies but gossiping and caring about privileges for her children.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{cognitive}} abilities investigated in the dolphin include concept formation, sensory skills, {{and the use}} of mental representation of dolphins. Such research has been ongoing since the late 1970s, and includes the specific topics of: acoustic mimicry, behavioral mimicry (inter- and intra-specific), comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language (including non-finite state grammars as well as novel anomalous sequences), memory, monitoring of self-behaviors (including reporting on these, as well as avoiding or repeating them), reporting on the presence and absence of objects, object categorization, discrimination and matching (identity matching to sample, delayed matching to sample, arbitrary matching to sample, matching across echolocation and vision, reporting that no identity match exists, etc.), synchronous creative behaviors between two animals, comprehension of symbols for various body parts, comprehension of the pointing gesture <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> (as made by dolphins or humans), problem solving, echolocative eavesdropping, and more. Some researchers include Louis Herman, Mark Xitco, John Gory, Stan Kuczaj, Adam Pack, and many others.|$|E

500|$|The five {{survivors}} slowly recovered {{their strength}} with {{a diet of}} seal meat. The ice was too thin for them to risk the final trip to Cape Evans, and the monotony of their diet and surroundings became wearisome. On 8 May [...] Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice and walk to Cape Evans. Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed, and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard. The others went {{to look for them}} after the storm and found only tracks leading {{to the edge of the}} broken ice. Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again. They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe. Richards, Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans, where they were at last reunited with Stevens, Cope, Jack <b>and</b> <b>Gaze.</b>|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} main march to Mount Hope began, on 1 January 1916, {{the failure of}} a Primus stove led to three men (Cope, Jack <b>and</b> <b>Gaze)</b> {{returning}} to Cape Evans, where they joined Stevens. The scientist had remained at the base to take weather measurements and watch for the ship. The remaining six sledged south, with Spencer-Smith failing rapidly and Mackintosh complaining of a painful knee. [...] They battled on, laying the depots, using only minimum provisions themselves although, at Joyce's insistence, keeping the dogs well-fed: [...] "The dogs are our only hope; our lives depend on them." [...] As they neared Mount Hope, Spencer-Smith collapsed, unable to proceed. The others left him alone in a small tent and travelled the remaining few miles to lay the final depot at Mount Hope on 26 January 1916. [...] Ernest Wild left a letter for his brother Frank who he assumed was by then travelling across from the Weddell Sea with Shackleton.|$|E

500|$|During {{his junior}} year, Presley began {{to stand out}} more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's {{thriving}} blues scene, <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> longingly at the wild, flashy clothes {{in the windows of}} Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them. Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual [...] "Minstrel" [...] show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed musicâ€”only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazines Matthew Cole {{was less}} impressed, believing West had contributed a [...] "powerhouse production" [...] {{but that the}} album [...] "requires you to {{tolerate}} the artists' self-mythologizing and put up with their sometimes awkward attempts at experimentation." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was more critical and found their rapping [...] "pretty mediocre", partly because [...] "too often here their complacent, back-slapping laxity leaves tracks floundering." [...] In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot found the record plagued by Jay-Z and West's [...] "self-regard", writing that [...] "they urge listeners to 'watch the throne,' <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> in awe on their good fortune." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone felt that [...] "on a record this ambitious, this sonically bold, it's a shame two of music's greatest storytellers don't extend their gaze beyond their own luxe lives." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker stated, [...] "Weed the album down to a healthy ten, and [...] doesn't become either classic or coherent, but it does work as an entertaining document of two wildly creative, not particularly wound-up friends." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] â€” hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games â€” this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them â€” just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail â€“ in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] â€“ described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

2500|$|From October 1869 to 1872 Eminescu {{studied in}} Vienna. Not {{fulfilling}} the requirements {{to become a}} university student (as {{he did not have}} a baccalaureate degree), he attended lectures as a so-called [...] "extraordinary auditor" [...] at the Faculty of Philosophy and Law. He was active in student life, befriended Ioan Slavici, and came to know Vienna through Veronica Micle; he became a contributor to Convorbiri Literare (Literary Conversations), edited by Junimea (The Youth). The leaders of this cultural organisation, Petre P. Carp, Vasile Pogor, Theodor Rosetti, Iacob Negruzzi and Titu Maiorescu, exercised their political and cultural influence over Eminescu for the rest of his life. Impressed by one of Eminescu's poems, Venere ÅŸi MadonÄƒ (Venus and Madonna), Iacob Negruzzi, the editor of Convorbiri Literare, traveled to Vienna to meet him. Negruzzi would later write how he could pick Eminescu out of a crowd of young people in a Viennese cafÃ© by his [...] "romantic" [...] appearance: long hair <b>and</b> <b>gaze</b> lost in thoughts.|$|E
