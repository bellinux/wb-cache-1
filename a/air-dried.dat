5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, <b>air-dried</b> sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E

30|$|The average {{duration}} {{for complete}} <b>air-drying</b> was 40.8  s. The results of one-way ANOVA {{revealed that the}} duration required for <b>air-drying</b> depended {{on the site of}} the restoration. The <b>air-drying</b> duration in lower molar restorations was 48.1  ±  21.7  s. One case required 90  s to reach the point at which rippling of the primer liquid ceased. The <b>air-drying</b> duration in upper anterior restorations was 27.3  ±  14.6  s, and was significantly shorter than the duration for lower molar restorations (p =  0.002).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to clarify the relationship between the duration of <b>air-drying</b> of one-step self-etch adhesives (1 -SEAs) and the evaporation degree (ED) of solvents, and (2) to evaluate the effect of ED on the ultimate micro-tensile strength (microTS) of the adhesives. METHODS: The ED of one HEMA-rich 1 -SEA, Clearfil S 3 Bond (Kuraray), and two HEMA-free 1 -SEAs, iBond (Heraeus-Kulzer) and G-Bond (GC), was determined without <b>air-drying</b> and after, respectively, 5 - and 10 -s <b>air-drying</b> using a gravimetric method. Next, the microTS of the adhesives at ED equivalent to 0 -, 5 - and 10 -s <b>air-drying</b> was measured. RESULTS: The ED increased with extension of <b>air-drying</b> time. Among the adhesives tested, iBond showed the largest ED, followed by G-Bond and Clearfil S 3 Bond in this order. A longer <b>air-drying</b> time for 10 -s resulted in a statistically significantly higher microTS for the HEMA-rich Clearfil S 3 Bond. The microTS of the latter was higher than that of the other two HEMA-free adhesives for each <b>air-drying</b> time. SIGNIFICANCE: <b>Air-drying</b> of 1 -SEAs had a significant effect on the degree of solvent evaporation (ED) and also on the mechanical properties (microTS) of the 1 -SEAs upon setting. It is therefore beneficial to remove solvents of the 1 -SEAs as much as possible by thorough, strong <b>air-drying</b> in order to achieve a strong adhesive layer at the interface. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|The results {{indicated}} that 48.1  ±  21.7  s of <b>air-drying</b> was required for the mandibular posterior cavities even when the intra-oral vacuum device was used. Although the manufacturer’s guide only recommends evaporating the volatile ingredients for 20  s with a mild oil-free air stream after conditioning the tooth surface, a definite drying time has not been specified. The duration of <b>air-drying</b> has been reported {{as one of the}} factors affecting the bond strength [39 – 41]. This study clarified the necessity of extended <b>air-drying</b> for solvent evaporation. Further extended <b>air-drying</b> might be needed if no dry-field technique has been applied.|$|R
30|$|To {{clarify the}} optimal amount of <b>air-drying</b> time, this study {{measured}} the time taken to remove residual excess solvent from self-etching primer under observation with a 3 D video microscope. One hundred teeth were restored with direct resin composite restorations (16 upper anterior teeth, three lower anterior teeth, 14 upper premolars, 13 lower premolars, 16 upper molars, and 38 lower molars) under observation with a 3 D video microscope. In all restorations, Clearfil SE Protect {{was used for}} bonding of the resin composite under controlled environmental conditions (intra-oral temperature and humidity) using an intra-oral vacuum device. The duration of <b>air-drying</b> needed to evaporate the residual solvent from the self-etching primer solution was simultaneously measured. The data obtained were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD multiple comparisons (p <  0.05). The duration for complete <b>air-drying</b> of the 100 cases was 40.9  ±  18.7  s. The <b>air-drying</b> durations in lower molar and upper anterior restorations were 48.1  ±  21.7 and 27.3  ±  14.6  s, respectively, with {{a statistically significant difference}} (p =  0.002). This study revealed that a greater <b>air-drying</b> duration was needed to evaporate solvent from the self-etching primer than routine <b>air-drying</b> in the clinical situation. It also indicated that a greater <b>air-drying</b> duration was required for posterior cavities than for anterior cavities.|$|R
25|$|When an open {{collection}} system is used, the pump’s suction can cause milk to overflow {{it into the}} {{collection system}} tubing, which may lead to milk particles being drawn into the pump motor. If milk leaks into the pump's tubing, the tubes should be washed, sterilized and <b>air-dried</b> prior to using the pump again. Failure to thoroughly clean collection tubing may lead to mold growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} an {{modernization}} of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber {{did not have to}} be <b>air-dried</b> for two years before being made to pulp, freeing up a storage site at Veden which had stored up to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) of lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was covered through procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.|$|E
25|$|The Māori of New Zealand {{used the}} {{rhizomes}} of P. esculentum (aruhe) as a staple food, especially for exploring or hunting groups away from permanent settlements; {{much of the}} widespread distribution of this species in present-day New Zealand {{is in fact a}} consequence of prehistoric deforestation and subsequent tending of aruhe stands on rich soils (which produced the best rhizomes). The rhizomes were <b>air-dried</b> so that they could be stored and became lighter; for consumption, they were briefly heated and then softened with a patu aruhe (rhizome pounder); the starch could then be sucked from the fibers by each diner, or collected if it were to be prepared for a larger feast. Patu aruhe were significant items and several distinct styles were developed.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Solvent {{content of}} a {{contemporary}} dental adhesive affect the bonding process, {{especially in the case}} of acetone based adhesives. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different <b>air-drying</b> periods on microtensile bond strength (MTBS) of a total-etch adhesive to dentin. Materials and Methods: Prime & Bond NT (Dentsply-USA) was used with different <b>air-drying</b> periods (0, 2, 5, 10, 30 sec) for bonding a composite resin to prepared dentin. The specimens were then subjected to a tensile force until fracture and the MTBSs of the samples were recorded. Failure modes of the fractured samples were also determined using stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni tests (P = 0. 05). Results: With increasing the <b>air-drying</b> periods, the MTBSs were increased until the 5 second air-blowing; after that, with increasing the <b>air-drying</b> periods, the MTBSs decreased. Both, the most complicated failure and the strongest bond were seen in the 5 sec <b>air-drying</b> group. Conclusion: There is an optimum <b>air-drying</b> time for acetone based adhesives which results in the strongest bond to dentin...|$|R
40|$|Effect {{of surface}} area and <b>air-drying</b> {{distance}} on shear bond strength of etch-and-rinse adhesive Abstract: We evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>air-drying</b> distance and bond sur-face area on the shear bond strength of a 2 -step etch-and-rinse adhe-sive. A total of 120 bovine anterior teeth were equally divided into 6 main groups based on bonding surface area.

The shear strength was determined using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5  mm/min. The averaged results were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α =  0. 05). Two-way ANOVA testing identified no significant cross-product interactions (p>  0. 05), but the main factors of area (p <  0. 0001) and <b>air-drying</b> distance (p <  0. 00001) significantly affected the mean bond strength.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{moisture}} content on the stress {{wave propagation velocity}} was investigated in order to estimate the Young’s modulus of full-scale timbers in an <b>air-drying</b> state using the measurement of stress wave propagation velocity above the fiber saturation point. Using Japanese cedar lumber, the velocity and the density under high-moisture condition and <b>air-drying</b> states were measured respectively; after measuring the modulus of elasticity in an <b>air-drying</b> state, the moisture content of each condition was measured. By performing numerical analysis on these data, {{the relationship between the}} moisture content and the rate of change of velocity of full-scale timbers was derived. This relationship was used to estimate the Young’s modulus of the timber in the <b>air-drying</b> state from the velocity in high-moisture condition. First, the velocity and the Young’s modulus in an <b>air-drying</b> state were estimated accurately from its density, moisture content and velocity under high-moisture condition. In cases where the density could not be measured, using the database of mechanical properties with the Monte Carlo simulation method, the Young’s modulus of the full-scale timber in an <b>air-drying</b> state might be estimated within 20 % accuracy from its moisture content and velocity under high-moisture condition.|$|R

Unlike green tea produced in China which is dried with hot air after the pan-frying stage to completely kill enzyme activity, leaves used {{in the production of}} pu'er are not <b>air-dried</b> after pan-roasting, which leaves a small amount of enzymes which contribute a minor amount of oxidation to the leaves during sun-drying. The bruising of the tea is also important in helping this minimal oxidation to occur, and both of these steps are significant in contributing to the unique characteristics of pu'er tea.|$|E
2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is <b>air-dried</b> [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|E
