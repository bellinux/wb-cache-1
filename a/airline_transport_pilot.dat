The wheels up landing performed by the flight crew during the emergency landing and improper aircraft pre-flight by the pilot in command. Factors were the unsecured cargo door, the cemetery fence, and the lack of crew coordination during the flight.|$|R
40|$|Operating a {{spacecraft}} {{is a complex}} and demanding task that requires years of training and constant monitoring of both navigation and systems parameters. By examining differences in scanning between “expert ” and “novice ” operators, we can develop cognitive models of scanning behavior or enhance training. In the Intelligent Spacecraft Interface Systems (ISIS) laboratory, we measure eye movements and record performance parameters in a part-task space shuttle cockpit simulator. We trained <b>airline</b> <b>transport</b> <b>pilots</b> (as our “novice ” group) on fundamentals of flying an ascent (“launch-to-orbit”) in the space shuttle. We tested three levels of malfunctions occurring during a trial—none (nominal), one malfunction, or three malfunctions—on both pilots and astronauts (our “expert ” group). Astronauts had fewer errors and faster reaction times. Eye movement analyses showed that both astronauts and pilots similarly modified their scan strategies depending on the flight segment and how many malfunctions occurred during a trial...|$|R
