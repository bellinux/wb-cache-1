40|$|Neoplasms {{derived from}} {{granulated}} acidophils of the canine ade-nohypophysis are extremely rare even though acidophils constitute {{a significant proportion}} of the cell population of this endocrine organ in the normal dog. A review of the literature revealed only 5 neoplasms derived from acidophils, viz. adenomas (4 dogs) lOp 123 18, % 28 and an adenocarcinoma (1 d 0 g) l 4. LCCKSCH~ * reported an <b>acidophil</b> <b>adenoma</b> in a dog which had thickened cranial bones. RUTISHAIJSER~ ~ and PERL-MAN^ ^ in separate reports described a 13 -year-old poodle with an acido-phi 1 adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, chronic nephritis, and fibrous osteodystrophy. They postulated the hypophysial neoplasm was pro-ducing a parathyrotropic factor which was responsibIe for the para-thyroid hyperplasia. Based on present kowledge a more likely inter-pretation would be that the hypophysial neoplasm was unrelated to a syndrome of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism and fibrous osteo-dystrophy 16 occurring concomitantly in this dog.

40|$|A 41 -year-old male {{presented}} with progressive visual defects, acromegaly and hyperthyroidism. After clinical evaluation a giant GH/TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma was diagnosed. Administration of the somatostatin analog octreotide at doses of 150 mg s. c. per day inhibited the secretion of both GH and TSH. A three-week treatment with octreotide prior to surgery led to slight visual improvement and CT scan showed some new necrotic areas within the tumor mass. Transcranial surgery was performed. By immunohistochemical {{analyses of the}} adenoma tissue GH, prolactin and b-chorionic gonadotropin were detected; TSH was negative. Electron microscopy revealed an undifferentiated, monomorphous adenoma with morphological features of an <b>acidophil</b> stem cell <b>adenoma</b> such {{as the presence of}} misplaced exocytoses, fibrous bodies and mitochondrial gigantism. However, the tumor cells contained small secretory granules (up to 250 nm) accumulated along the cell membrane characteristic of thyrotrope cells. Furthermore, some adenoma cells were fusiform with long cytoplasmic processes resembling thyrotropes. Two months after the operation CT scan revealed a large residual tumor. Serum GH and TSH levels had increased again and the TSH level was even higher than before the treatment. The patient die...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} and hormone {{production of}} pituitary adenoma cell cultures were compared {{in order to}} highlight their characteristic in vitro features. Cell suspensions were prepared from 494 surgical specimens. The 319 viable monolayer cultures were analyzed in detail by light microscopy and immunocytochemistry within two weeks of cultivation. Some cultures were further characterized by scanning, transmission and immunogold electron microscopy. The viability and detailed in vitro morphology of adenoma cells {{were found to be}} characteristic for the various types of pituitary tumors. The sparsely granulated growth hormone, the corticotroph and the <b>acidophil</b> stem cell <b>adenomas</b> provided the highest ratio of viable cultures. Occasionally, prolonged maintenance of cells resulted in long-term cultures. Furthermore, a variety of particular distributions of different hormone-containing granules were found in several cases. Both light microscopic and ultrastructural analyses proved that the primary cultures of adenoma cells retain their physiological features during in vitro cultivations. Our in vitro findings correlated with the routine histopathological examination. These results prove that monolayer cultures of pituitary adenoma cells can contribute to the correct diagnosis and are valid model systems for various oncological and neuroendocrinological studies...|$|R
40|$|Acromegaly is {{frequently}} associated with {{impaired glucose tolerance}} and/or diabetes. To evaluate the relationship between glucose metabolism and acromegaly disease, we evaluated 269 consecutive patients from two referral centres. Clinical presentation, pituitary tumor size and invasiveness, and pituitary pathology were captured in a dedicated database. 131 women and 138 men {{with a mean age}} of 53. 8 years were included. Of these, 201 (74. 7 %) presented with a macroadenoma and 18 (6. 7 %) with a microadenoma. Radiographic invasion was present in 91 cases (33. 8 %). Mean tumor diameter was 1. 86 cm (0. 2 - 4. 6). Pituitary histopathologic findings revealed pure GH-producing somatotroph adenomas (SA) in 147 patients, prolactin-production by mixed lactotroph (LA) and SA or mammosomatotroph adenoma (MSA) in 46 [22. 4 %], <b>acidophil</b> stem cell <b>adenoma</b> in 6 [2. 9 %], and other diagnoses in 6 [2. 9 %]. Medical treatment included octreotide in 96 [36. 9 %] and in combination with pegvisomant or dopamine agonists in 63 [24. 2 %]. Nearly 80 % of patients achieved IGF- 1 normalization. Importantly, patients with pure somatotroph adenomas were significantly more likely to present with abnormal glucose metabolism [48. 7 %] than those with mixed adenomas [9. 7 %] [p< 0. 001] independent of GH/IGF- 1 levels or tumor invasiveness. Abnormal glucose metabolism and pituitary pathology also remained linked following IGF- 1 normalization. Moreover patients with pure SA and abnormal glucose metabolism were significantly (p< 0. 001) less likely to achieve disease remission despite the same therapeutic strategies. Conversely, patients with mixed adenomas were more likely (OR: 2. 766 (95 % CI: 1. 490 - 5. 136) to achieve disease remission. Patients with pure somatotroph adenomas are more likely than those with mixed adenomas to exhibit abnormal glucose metabolism...|$|R
