40|$|Polymers {{containing}} the Azo-benzene group have attracted attention due to anticipated uses such as materials for data storage, membranes with controllable permeability and materials with changeable solubility [1, 2].

40|$|Different {{methods that}} are used to measure peroxyl radical (ROO) {{scavenging}} capacity were used in model systems containing four common antioxidant compounds: ascorbic acid, cysteine, gallic acid and Trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue. Five tests were performed, with differences in the method of peroxyl radical generation (lipoxygenase, <b>azo-compound</b> thermal degradation and spontaneous oxidation from a natural source of fatty acids) and in the addition of probes such as linoleic acid, crocin, fluorescein and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) by spin-trapping with a-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone. Significant differences were found in antioxidant reactivity, evaluated by dose–effect semi-logarithmic plots and EC 50 values, and a possible explanation for these differences was explored. In assays in which ROO was generated by the <b>azo-compound</b> or spontaneous oxidation, gallic acid was the most powerful antioxidant. When lipoxygenase was used to produce ROO, ascorbic acid had the highest scavenging index, while cysteine and gallic acid had low levels of activity. Another difference was identified regarding the molecular probe: ascorbic acid and Trolox were the least reactive in the EPR system and azo-bis system with fluorescein, while in assays with crocin, these compounds had intermediate activities. Ascorbic acid and Trolox were the best antioxidants in an enzymatic-linoleic acid system, with a reciprocal ratio of 6 : 1, while adding crocin to the same system changed the reciprocal ratio to 2 : 1.

40|$|Generation of neoepitopes on apolipoprotein B within {{oxidised}} {{low-density lipoprotein}} (LDL) {{is important in}} the unregulated uptake of LDL by monocytic scavenger receptors (CD 36, SR-AI, LOX- 1). Freshly isolated LDL was oxidised by peroxyl radicals generated from the thermal decomposition of an aqueous <b>azo-compound.</b> We describe that formation of carbonyl groups on the protein component is early as protein oxidation was seen after 90 min. This is associated with an increased propensity for LDL uptake by U 937 monocytes. Three classes of antioxidants (quercetin, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and ascorbic acid) have been examined for their capacity to inhibit AAPH-induced protein oxidation, (protein carbonyls, Δ electrophoretic mobility and LDL uptake by U 937 monocytes). CD 36 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and was seen to be unaltered by oxidised LDL uptake. All three classes were effective antioxidants, quercetin (P< 0. 01), ascorbic acid (P< 0. 01), DHEA (P< 0. 05). As LDL protein is the control point for LDL metabolism, the degree of oxidation and protection by antioxidants is likely to be of great importance for (patho) -physiological uptake of LDL by monocytes. © 2003 Elsevier B.

In this respect, the properties of three selected thiol-containing drugs (Captopril, N-acetylcystiene and its lysine salt Nacystelyn, a newly developed mucoactive agent) and of reference compounds were examined in a lipid peroxidation model using human red blood cells (RBC) as biological substrate. The thermolabile <b>azo-compound</b> 2, 2 ′-azobis- 2 -amidinopropane dihydrochloride (AAPH) served for the generation of an oxidative stress and {{the determination of the}} extent of RBC haemolysis was recorded. Experimental conditions were developed and optimised to ensure the stability and reproducibility of the system and to establish complete dose-response relationships in order to determine relevant pharmacological parameters. Actually, the AAPH/haemolysis system shrewdly combined with a procedure to measure the extent of haemolysis in which all common haemoglobin derivatives released following haemolysis are converted to cyanomethaemoglobin, allowed the assessment of the antioxidant activity of most investigated drugs. Precision was also improved by considering readings at 50 % haemolysis (T 50).

40|$|ABSTRACT Hypertension is {{considered}} as a state of oxidative stress which contribute to several organ damages. The crude leaf of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.

The present study aimed to test our hypothesis that if there is an increase in erythrocyte lipid peroxidation in hypertensive rats, then there should be increased in erythrocyte hemolysis as well. In addition, the NN extract would protect erythrocyte membrane from free radical-induced oxidation. The constriction of left renal artery was used to induce hypertension in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The oxidative hemolysis of erythrocytes was performed by using the <b>azo-compound</b> 2, 2 '-Azobis (2 amidinoporpane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) as a peroxyl radical initiator. The free radical scavenging activity of NN extract was measured by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazil (DPPH). The total of NN extract phenolic contents was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The time-dependent hemolysis curve of erythrocyte from hypertensive rats was similar to that of normotensive ones. The 50 percent inhibitory concentration hemolytic (IC 50) NN extract was 48. 2 ± 0. 2 and 46. 8 ± 1. 1 µg/ml in hypertensive and normotensive rats respectively. The concentration of the NN extract required to scavenge 50 percent DPPH radical (IC 50) was 18. 14 ± 3. 13. The NN extract was rich in phenolic compounds in that 20 - 160 µg of NN extract, and was corresponded to the amount of phenolic compounds 3. 98 - 20. 38 µg gallic acid equivalents. The susceptibility of rat erythrocytes to peroxidation in hypertensive rats was similar to that of normotensive ones. NN extract have the ability to protect rat erythrocytes against AAPH-induced hemolysis in hypertensive as well as in normotensive rats.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of pentafluorobenzoyl peroxide in carbon tetrachloride {{and also in}} hexafluorobenzene, either alone or {{in the presence of}} nitrogen dioxide (15 [...] 230 fold molar excess), has been studied. In all reactions, except that in the absence of nitrogen dioxide, high yields of fluoride ion and pentafluorobenzoic acid were formed. Evidence was obtained to suggest the presence of pentafluorobenzoic anhydride as an important reaction product, although this evidence was lacking {{in the case of the}} reaction in hexafluorobenzene. In reactions carried out in the presence of nitrogen dioxide, the formation of pentafluorobenzoyl nitrate is considered to be an important step in the route to pentafluorobenzoic acid. Pentafluorobenzoyl nitrate may also lead indirectly to the production of fluoride ion through the intermediacy of nitryl fluoride, the formation of which may depend on an intramolecular rearrangement of the nitrate. Other reaction products were nitropentafluorobenzene, pentafluorophenyl pentafluorobenzoate and decafluoro-biphenyl, all detected in low yields in reactions carried out in the presence of nitrogen dioxide; whereas, in carbon tetrachloride in the absence of nitrogen dioxide, the predominant reaction was abstraction of chlorine from the solvent with formation of chloropentafluorobenzene. The kinetics of the {{decomposition of}} pentafluoro-phenylazotriphenylmethane in aromatic solvents have been studied. The synthesis of this new <b>azo-compound</b> is described.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{intestinal}} bacterium Enterococcus faecalis to reduce a range of azo dyes was studied and the optimal pH and temperature for azoreductase activity were determined. The rate of dye reduction was highly variable between dyes. No obvious correlation existed between chemical structure of dye and reduction rate. Both glucose and lactate acted as electron donors for dye reduction. lodoacetate, HQNO and PCMB inhibited azo reduction whereas sodium azide did not, thus demonstrating that azoreduction involves a flavin-based electron transport system. The genotoxic and mutagenic activity of the dyes was investigated prior to and following reduction by Ent. faecalis {{using a variety of}} assays. Again there was considerable variation among the dyes tested with regard to the production of genotoxic and mutagenic agents. Although the majority of dyes showed little or no mutagenicity in the Salmonella/mutagenicity assay (Ames test), the M 13 mutagenesis assay and the SOS Chromotest many were active using the Fluctuation assay. These dyes were also highly genotoxic using a differential killing assay with repair-proficient and repair-deficient E. coli strains. Although it was thought that reductive cleavage of the <b>azo-compound</b> generates metabolites that are able to damage DNA, activation was not always dependent on dye reduction by Ent. faecalis. While mutagenicity was not observed in the M 13 mutagenesis assay the rate of bacteriophage transfection was lowered after exposure to the dyes under certain conditions, which may again be a reflection of DNA damage. The precise nature and significance of this damage in terms of toxicity and/or carcinogenicity remains to be determined. The electrochemical characteristics of the azo dyes were studied in aqueous buffer systems. Upon electrolytic reduction of the dyes a single irreversible reduction process was observed when using repeat scan cyclic voltammetry (CV). The reduction potentials of the first forward wave could be roughly correlated with the bacterial metabolism of the dyes as measured spectrophotometrically. Although a reverse wave for the azo-reduction process was absent, an associated oxidation wave was frequently observed in the return sweep of the CV due to the formation of a new redox-active species. No data has been obtained to suggest that the damaging compound produced upon reductive cleavage of the azo bond or the mechanism of genotoxicity is related to the new redox-active complex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract It is a {{challenge}} to attain high selectivity to azoxy-compounds in the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds as azoxy-compounds can be readily reduced to azo- and aniline compounds. We proposed a new solution to this challenge: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on hydrotalcite (HT) support were used to catalyze the reduction under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature; and phosphate (PO 4 3 −) and metal (such as Ga 3 +, Fe 3 +, Zn 2 +) ions were incorporated into the HT support to moderate the reduction power of the catalyst avoiding the formation of azo- and aniline compounds. Very high azoxy-compound selectivity was achieved under green mild conditions. The photocatalytic activity strongly depends on the incident light wavelength and intensity, and we can further enhance the catalytic efficiency of this photocatalytic process by slight increase in reaction temperature (e. g. 10 – 20 °C). Moreover, high stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also observed under the investigated conditions. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed based on the experimental results and literatures. The introduction of both phosphate and metal ions into HT support can prevent the further reduction of azoxy-compounds to <b>azo-compounds</b> or anilines and achieve excellent selectivity to azoxy-compounds.

These incidents have also necessitated the need for high throughput low cost reliable approaches for the detection and quantification of food contaminated by such azo compounds. While there are a small number of analytical techniques that can be considered portable, many lack sensitivity. By contrast, we show that employing a portable Raman spectrometer, using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), can provide good sensitivity, such that Sudan- 1 can be quantified in a complex food matrix reliably over the range of 10 - 3 to 10 - 4 mol L- 1. We also demonstrate that a variety of multivariate approaches including principal components analysis (PCA), partial least-squares (PLS) regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector regression (SVR) can be employed for the chemical analysis of this dye in a quantitative manner.

Moderate processing conditions enable encapsulation of various organic, inorganic and biological molecules in glasses having adjustable properties. This method is used for fabrication of sensors, catalyst supports, optical elements, coatings, and special polymers.;Thoughtful understanding of local environments around dopant molecules and interactions at molecular level between dopants and silica glass matrix are essential in achieving desired properties of these materials.;In our work we took advantage of silica glass transparency as well as high sensitivity of electronic spectroscopy techniques (absorption, emission, and circular dichroism spectroscopy) to study physico-chemical behavior of low-concentrated organic and biological dopant molecules under the controlled various conditions. Hence, we studied the effects of sol-gel silica glass on activity and conformational stability of the encapsulated bovine carbonic anhydrase. A porous silica monolith limits access of an ester substrate to the enzyme embedded in the silica, and hence modulates {{the activity of the}} encapsulated enzyme. The conformational stability of the enzyme seems to be retained upon the encapsulation in this inorganic matrix. The classical hydrogen bonding interactions between silica glass and different organic compounds diffused into the glass modulate mobility and chemical reactivity of these compounds. Hydrogen bonding, also, causes immense accumulation of organic molecules from their solution into the silica matrix. Unexpectedly, hydrophobic aromatic hydrocarbons get accumulated into hydrophilic sol-gel silica matrix due to the hydrogen bonding between their aromatic It system and hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. We achieved full control over these interactions by using organic solvents with different hydrogen bonding propensity. In study of chemical reactivities of azo compounds inside micelle/silica composites, we discovered that these compounds partition between SDS/silica composite and a surrounding solution and that modulates their reactivity.

40|$|From the {{experiments}} {{which have been}} reported, it follows that animals sensitized with one azoprotein react {{not only to the}} antigen used for the sensitization, but also to other azoproteins made up from the same simple <b>azo-compounds</b> and another protein. Although the specificity of the reaction has not yet been tested with various azo-components, its actual existence can reasonably be assumed {{on the basis of the}} phenomena observed in precipitation reactions. The sensitization is brought about with less facility than sensitization against the usual antigens and the effects are not uniform. Still, after sufficient treatment, 40 per cent of the animals succumbed with typical anaphylactic symptoms, mostly within a short time while 16 per cent showed severe symptoms. The experiments show that it is possible to make animals hypersensitive against a simple chemical group like para-arsanilic acid, and from this point of view connection would seem to be established with the phenomena of drug allergy in human beings. There is an essential difference, however, in that the sensitized animals did not react on injections of simple compounds such as para-amino-phenyl-arsanilic acid and phenyl- 4 -arsonic-acid-azo-tyrosine uncombined with protein. It remains to be determined whether under changed conditions positive results in this direction can be obtained. For this purpose it seems advisable to make experiments with isolated organs, according to the method of Schultz and Dale. While the simple substances failed to elicit direct reactions, they protected (as was foreseen by Doerr) against a subsequent injection of the active antigen. Similar compounds not containing the arsanilic acid group were considerably less active. The phenomenon is comparable to the inhibition of precipitin reactions already described. Considering the protection as a condition of antianaphylaxis, one would suppose that the simple substances mentioned are fixed by the cells in which the anaphylactic reaction takes place. It may be concluded that: 1. Animals can be sensitized through injections of one azoprotein—protein combined with diazotized para-arsanilic acid—against another compound containing the same azo-component but a different protein. 2. Injections of related simple compounds, as for instance para-arsanilic acid and phenyl- 4 -arsonic-acid-azo-tyrosine did not cause shock in the sensitized animals under the conditions of the present experiments. 3.
