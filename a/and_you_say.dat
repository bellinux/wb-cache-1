2500|$|In a panel {{discussion}} at Yeshiva University on October 22, 2013, Adelson said that the United States must get tougher about Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Controversy arose when he said: [...] "You pick up your cell phone and you call somewhere in Nebraska <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'OK, let it go' and so there’s an atomic weapon goes over, ballistic missiles {{in the middle of}} the desert that doesn’t hurt a soul, maybe a couple of rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever”. He went on to explain that, after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on Tehran, the U.S. should then say: if [...] "You [...] want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee that you can have a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes." [...] Adelson's spokesman told reporters that Adelson [...] "was obviously not speaking literally" [...] about using an atomic bomb in the desert, and that he was [...] "using hyperbole to make a point that … actions speak louder than words".|$|E
2500|$|Austin's rise {{to stardom}} {{began at the}} 1996 King of the Ring. He began using his {{trademark}} finishing maneuver, the Stone Cold Stunner; with this new technique, he won the King of the Ring tournament. After defeating Marc Mero in the semi-finals, Austin defeated Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts in the finals. The Stunner debuted on June 8, 1996 on Superstars when he defeated jobber Jason Arndt, who later became known as Joey Abs {{a member of the}} Mean Street Posse. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous promo during his coronation, telling Roberts, [...] "You sit there and you thump your Bible, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your Psalms, talk about ... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck. Triple H was originally scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring, but was punished for the infamous Curtain Call incident that had transpired earlier that year. [...] "Austin 3:16" [...] ultimately {{became one of the most}} popular catchphrases in wrestling history and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history. It is also credited as the iconic moment that began the WWF's [...] "Attitude Era".|$|E
2500|$|On September 6, 2007, Nas {{performed}} at a free concert for the Virginia Tech student body and faculty, following the school shooting there. He {{was joined by}} John Mayer, Alan Jackson, Phil Vassar, and Dave Matthews Band. When announced that Nas was to perform, political commentator Bill O'Reilly and Fox News denounced the concert and called for Nas's removal, citing [...] "violent" [...] lyrics on songs such as [...] "Shoot 'Em Up", [...] "Got Urself a Gun", and [...] "Made You Look". During his Talking Points Memo segment for August 15, 2007, an argument erupted in which O'Reilly claimed {{that it was not}} only Nas's lyrical content that made him inappropriate for the event, citing the gun conviction on Nas's criminal record. In the midst of his debate with author Bakari Kitwana (The Hip Hop Generation), who defended Nas, claiming that Fox News had [...] "cherry picked" [...] select fragments of the songs to make their case, O'Reilly shouted, [...] "Even in his personal life, man, he's got a conviction for weapons, all right? He's got a weapons conviction, sir! On his sheet! This is a school that had a mass murderer with a shotgun gunning down people—this guy has got a conviction for weapons, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> he's appropriate? Come on!"

2500|$|Perhaps {{you will}} say, [...] "I see {{something}} else, {{how is it}} that you assert that I receive the Body of Christ?" ... Let us prove that this is not what nature made, but what the blessing consecrated, and the power of blessing is greater than that of nature, because by blessing nature itself is changed. ... For that sacrament which you receive is made what it is by the word of Christ. But if the word of Elijah had such power as to bring down fire from heaven, shall not the word of Christ have power to change the nature of the elements? ... Why do you seek the order of nature in the Body of Christ, seeing that the Lord Jesus Himself was born of a Virgin, not according to nature? It is the true Flesh of Christ which was crucified and buried, this is then truly the Sacrament of His Body. The Lord Jesus Himself proclaims: [...] "This Is My Body." [...] Before the blessing of the heavenly words another nature is spoken of, after the consecration the Body is signified. He Himself speaks of His Blood. Before the consecration it has another name, after it is called Blood. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Amen, that is, It is true. Let the heart within confess what the mouth utters, let the soul feel what the voice speaks." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first single, [...] "It's Alright, It's OK", Tisdale said, [...] "is a strong, {{empowering}} {{song that}} kind of helps you move on" [...] and continued to say: I have definitely [...] on and with someone you really like, if they are cheating on you, you don't want to believe it. But, unfortunately, you either stay in the relationship and keep getting hurt because it keeps happening or you get up and you move on. You don't look back. Tisdale said the song [...] "Hot Mess" [...] is [...] "about hanging out with a motorcycle bad boy that makes life more interesting" [...] and the song [...] "How Do You Love Someone" [...] written by Porcelain Black (Alaina Beaton) is [...] "about a girl who deals with the split of her parents". Tisdale also said, the song could be about [...] "When you have been cheated on or you're in a relationship". Black was initially reluctant to let Tisdale record the song, but eventually green-lit the track. However, she recorded her RedOne-produced version which will feature guest vocals by Eminem for her upcoming debut album. Tisdale co-wrote several songs on the album such as [...] "What If", which was co-written with Kara DioGuardi. Tisdale described [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song on the album, she said the song [...] "is about when you’re in a relationship <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'If I really needed you, would you actually be there?’" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
