40|$|Grafting of cell-seeded {{alginate}} capillary hydrogels into {{a spinal}} cord lesion site provides an <b>axonal</b> <b>bridge</b> while physically directing regenerating axonal growth in a linear pattern. However, without an additional growth stimulus, bridging axons fail to extend into the distal host spinal cord. Here we examined whether a combinatory strategy would support regeneration of descending axons across a cervical (C 5) lateral hemisection lesion in the rat spinal cord. Following spinal cord transections, Schwann cell (SC) -seeded alginate hydrogels were grafted to the lesion site and AAV 5 expressing {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter was injected caudally. In addition, we examined whether SC injection into the caudal spinal parenchyma would further enhance regeneration of descending axons to re-enter the host spinal cord. Our data show that both serotonergic and descending axons traced by biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) extend throughout the scaffolds. The number of regenerating axons is significantly increased when caudal BDNF expression is activated and transient BDNF delivery is able to sustain axons after gene expression is switched off. Descending axons are confined to the caudal graft/host interface even with continuous BDNF expression for 8 weeks. Only with a caudal injection of SCs, a pathway facilitating axonal regeneration through the host/graft interface is generated allowing axons to successfully re-enter the caudal spinal cord. Statement of Significance Recovery from spinal cord injury is poor due to the limited regeneration observed in the adult mammalian central nervous system. Biomaterials, cell transplantation and growth factors that can guide axons across a lesion site, provide a cellular substrate, stimulate axon growth and have shown some promise in increasing the growth distance of regenerating axons. In the present study, we combined an alginate biomaterial with linear channels with transplantation of Schwann cells within and beyond the lesion site and injection of a regulatable vector for the transient expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Our data show that only with the full combination axons extend across the lesion site and that expression of BDNF beyond 4 weeks does not further {{increase the number of}} regenerating axons.

40|$|Neurotrophic factor {{delivery}} to sites of {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) promotes axon growth into but not beyond lesion sites. We tested the hypothesis that sustained growth factor gradients beyond regions of SCI will promote significant <b>axonal</b> <b>bridging</b> into and beyond lesions. Adult rats underwent C 3 lesions to transect ascending dorsal column sensory axons, and autologous bone marrow stromal cells were grafted into the lesion to provide a cellular bridge for growth into the injured region. Concurrently, lentiviral vectors expressing neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (controls) were injected into the host cord rostral to the lesion to promote axon extension beyond the graft/lesion. Four weeks later, NT- 3 gradients beyond the lesion were detectable by ELISA in animals that received NT- 3 -expressing lentiviral vectors, with highest average NT- 3 levels located near the rostral vector injection site. Significantly more ascending sensory axons extended into tissue rostral to the lesion site in animals injected with NT- 3 vectors compared with GFP vectors, {{but only if the}} zone of NT- 3 vector transduction extended continuously from the injection site to the graft; any “gap ” in NT- 3 expression from the graft to rostral tissue resulted in axon bridging failure. Despite axon bridging beyond the lesion, regenerating axons did not continue to grow over very long distances, even {{in the presence of a}} continuing growth factor gradient beyond the lesion. These findings indicate that a localized and continuous gradient of NT- 3 can achieve <b>axonal</b> <b>bridging</b> beyond the glial scar, but growth for longer distances is not sustainable simply with a trophic stimulus.

40|$|A {{principal}} objective of {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) research is the restoration of axonal connectivity to denervated targets. We tested the hypothesis that chemotropic mechanisms would guide regenerating spinal cord axons to appropriate brainstem targets. Rats underwent cervical level 1 (C 1) lesions followed by combinatorial treatments to elicit <b>axonal</b> <b>bridging</b> into and beyond lesion sites. Lentiviral vectors expressing neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) were then injected into an appropriate brainstem target, the nucleus gracilis, and an inappropriate target, the reticular formation. NT- 3 expression in the correct target led to reinnervation of the nucleus gracilis in a dose-related fashion, whereas NT- 3 expression in the reticular formation led to mistargeting of regenerating axons. Axons regenerating into the nucleus gracilis formed axodendritic synapses containing rounded vesicles, reflective of pre-injury synaptic architecture. Thus, we report {{for the first time}} the reinnervation of brainstem targets after SCI, and an essential role for chemotropic axon guidance in target selection.

40|$|Safety is an {{increasingly}} important aspect of vehicle design. Legislation requires minimum levels of safety through full scale tests. Customers are provided with information regarding the safety performance of vehicles {{so that they can}} make an informed buying decision. Vehicle crashes were responsible for 40000 fatalities and 5. 2 million non fatally injured patients in the US during 1994. The direct and direct cost of head injuries in the US is estimated at $ 25 billion per year. Injury criteria that can predict the severity of head injuries are important engineering tools for improving vehicle safety. At present the injury that the human head is subjected to is predicted by the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). This criterion is inadequate as it is not based upon a thorough understanding of the underlying head injury mechanisms. The important blunt or non-contact head injury mechanisms are diffuse <b>axonal</b> injury, <b>bridging</b> vein disruption and surface contact contusions. The severity of these injury mechanisms is hypothesised {{to be related to the}} level of motion of the brain with respect to the skull. Finite element modelling is used to analyse these head injury mechanisms. Models are developed which include all the relevant anatomical entities and detail. Accurate material property information and boundary conditions are used in the modelling to ensure that the head injury mechanisms can be accurately simulated. Tissue failure criteria are developed to link the various field parameters monitored during the simulations with injury severity. The models are then comprehensively validated with information obtained from pathological observations, cadaver experiments, accident reconstructions and volunteer data. These models are then used to determine the biomechanics of head injury and to develop improved head injury tolerance curves. The simulations demonstrate that head injury severity is dependent upon the magnitude, pulse duration and direction of the applied translational and rotational acceleration pulses...|$|R
40|$|Although {{peripheral}} nerve injury is a common consequence of trauma or surgery, there are insufficient means for repair. In particular, there is a critical need for improved methods to facilitate regeneration of axons across major nerve lesions. Here, we engineered transplantable living nervous tissue constructs to provide a labeled pathway to guide host axonal regeneration. These constructs consisted of stretch-grown, longitudinally aligned living axonal tracts inserted into poly(glycolic acid) tubes. The constructs (allogenic) were transplanted to bridge an excised segment of sciatic nerve in the rat, and histological analyses were performed at 6 and 16 weeks posttransplantation to determine graft survival, integration, and host regeneration. At both time points, the transplanted constructs {{were found to have}} maintained their pretransplant geometry, with surviving clusters of graft neuronal somata at the extremities of the constructs spanned by tracts of axons. Throughout the transplanted region, there was an intertwining plexus of host and graft axons, suggesting that the transplanted axons mediated host axonal regeneration across the lesion. By 16 weeks posttransplant, extensive myelination of axons was observed throughout the transplant region. Further, graft neurons had extended axons beyond the margins of the transplanted region, penetrating into the host nerve. Notably, this survival and integration of the allogenic constructs occurred in the absence of immunosuppression therapy. These findings demonstrate the promise of living tissue-engineered <b>axonal</b> constructs to <b>bridge</b> major nerve lesions and promote host regeneration, potentially by providing axon-mediated axonal outgrowth and guidance...|$|R
40|$|Bridges for {{treatment}} of the injured spinal cord must stabilize the injury site to prevent secondary damage and create a permissive environment that promotes regeneration. The host response to the bridge is central to creating a permissive environment, as the cell types that respond to the injury {{have the potential to}} secrete both stimulatory and inhibitory factors. We investigated multiple channel bridges for spinal cord regeneration and correlated the bridge structure to cell infiltration and <b>axonal</b> elongation. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) <b>bridges</b> were fabricated by a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Channels within the bridge had diameters of 150 or 250 [*]μm, and {{the main body of the}} bridge was highly porous with a controllable pore size. Upon implantation in a rat spinal cord hemisection site, cells infiltrated into the bridge pores and channels, with the pore size influencing the rate of infiltration. The pores had significant cell infiltration, including fibroblasts, macrophages, S- 100 β-positive cells, and endothelial cells. The channels of the bridge were completely infiltrated with cells, which had aligned axially, and consisted primarily of fibroblasts, S- 100 β-positive cells, and endothelial cells. Reactive astrocytes were observed primarily outside of the bridge, and staining for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was decreased in the region surrounding the bridge relative to studies without bridges. Neurofilament staining revealed a preferential growth of the neural fibers within the bridge channels relative to the pores. Multiple channel bridges capable of supporting cellular infiltration, creating a permissive environment, and directing the growth of neural fibers have potential for promoting and directing spinal cord regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are {{amongst the}} best {{candidates}} for cell transplantation into lesions {{of the central}} nervous system. These specialised glial cells {{are found in the}} olfactory system and are associated with the physiological restoration of neuronal circuitry in the first cranial nerve of the adult. There is conflicting evidence {{on the extent to which}} OECs promote long distance axonal regeneration when transplanted into spinal cord lesions. In the first chapter of Results (chapter 3) we aimed to determine the potential of OEC transplantation in promoting axonal regeneration beyond the injury. This was investigated by producing a transection of the dorsal columns at the lumbar 3 -lumbar 4 (L 3 -L 4) border using a wire knife device that cut ascending primary sensory afferents and immediately after, transplanting olfactory bulb derived OECs into the lesion. Regeneration was assessed in these fibres by injecting the neurotracer biotin dextran amine (BDA) into the left L 4 and L 5 spinal roots and sacrificing the animals 6 weeks after the lesion. We detected axonal labelling in the lumbar and thoracic cord rostral to the dorsal column lesion; but the labelled axons included spared fibres. For this reason it was necessary to develop a quantification method that included only convincing regeneration and excluded sparing or potential sprouting. With care it was possible to detect convincing axonal regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons across the lesion in animals transplanted with OECs. Although there have been several claims of axonal regeneration following OEC transplantation in spinal cord pathways information is still lacking on the spatial relationship between regenerating axons and transplanted OECs. To understand this, OECs were transduced before transplantation with a lentiviral vector to express green fluorescent protein (GFP). With this technique it was possible to detect the OECs in the transplanted spinal cord and determine that tract traced axons preferentially regenerated though continuous tracts of GFP labelled OECs in continuity with the transplanted lesion, while they did not normally regenerate through the host spinal cord in areas devoid of OECs. Regeneration beyond the lesion in OEC transplanted animals was very limited in terms of both distance and numbers of axons. The conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve is a procedure which appears to prime DRG neurons for growth. We next asked whether the regeneration observed after an OEC transplant alone could be maximised by a combined treatment paradigm that included OEC transplantation and conditioning lesions. Conditioning lesions were performed by transecting the left sciatic nerve at mid thigh level and the spinal cord was lesioned at the L 3 -L 4 level. Long distance <b>bridging</b> <b>axonal</b> regeneration was strongly potentiated (58 fold). As seen in OEC transplanted animals, axons in the distal spinal cord were located preferentially in areas where OECs were also present. Regeneration was also studied at earlier and later time points. The number of regenerating axons was significantly greater if survival time was of 2 weeks from the lesion/transplantation compared to the 6 week survival, while it did not vary significantly between 6 weeks and 17 weeks survival. Direct comparison of the growth promoting effects exerted by OECs and Schwann cells have not so far been performed on transection type lesions, but only on other lesion models where sparing cannot be ruled out. To understand if these two cell types share similar properties with reference to promoting long distance axonal regeneration, in the second chapter of Results (chapter 4) we consider sciatic nerve derived Schwann cell transplantation alone or in combination with conditioning lesions following the same lesion paradigm in which OECs were transplanted. Interestingly, no significant difference was found between the growth promoting properties of the two glial cells. Furthermore, with Schwann cells as with OECs, regenerating axons in the distal spinal cord were associated mostly with the transplanted cells. To understand whether the long distance axonal regeneration observed was occurring irrespective of the cell type injected, we transplanted sciatic nerve derived fibroblasts in combination with conditioning lesions. With this lesion paradigm significantly less regeneration was detected indicating that fibroblasts are less effective than OECs and Schwann cells in terms of their regeneration promoting properties. On the other hand we determined that OECs, Schwann cells and fibroblasts all preserved the lesion integrity by preventing the lesion from dilating. Importantly, rats are now being used as a model of study for syringomyelia, a pathology that leads to progressive central canal cavitation. We have found that dilation of the central canal normally develops also in the wire knife dorsal column lesion model; however transplantation of OECs or Schwann cells significantly reduced the central canal dilation compared to non-transplanted animals. Any clinical use of cell transplantation will likely involve a delay between injury and treatment, and since a glial scar will develop and the regenerative response of the axotomised fibres may subside, it is not clear to what extent regeneration will occur. In the third chapter of results (chapter 5) we have therefore investigated whether delayed OEC transplantation might promote a significant level of regeneration. Surprisingly, the distribution of OECs following delayed transplantation was similar to that after an acute transplant and OECs formed tracts that were in continuity with the lesion transplant. The presence of these OEC tracts allowed regenerating axons to bridge the lesion and grow for relatively long distances on the other side. Delayed conditioning lesions were combined with delayed OEC transplantation and boosted axonal growth 9 times compared to delayed OEC transplanted animals.
