5|$|During this period, Arne Jacobsen {{became the}} country’s leading Modernist {{with the design}} of the SAS Hotel in Copenhagen (1960). Rødovre Town Hall, {{completed}} in 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Allow Me, {{also known}} as Umbrella Man, is an iconic 1983 bronze {{sculpture}} by John Seward Johnson II, located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. The sculpture, one of seven Allow Me casts, was donated anonymously to the City of Portland in 1984 for display in the Square. It depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, hailing a cab and holding an umbrella. Constructed from bronze, aluminum <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> the sculpture stands six feet, ten inches tall and weighs 460 pounds. The sculpture {{is one of many}} works of art generated by the city's Percent for Art program, and is considered part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{architecture}} is an austere combination of concrete <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> with stacked banks of escalators supported from the cross-bracing structures spanning the station box and routes for passengers entering or leaving the station separated from those changing between lines. As {{with the other}} underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform screen doors to improve airflow through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA's prestigious Stirling Prize.|$|E

5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E
5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E

40|$|Commercial alloys are {{continuously}} {{developed to}} improve their performance. Therefore {{it is important to}} develop new optimisation software, which could be used in development of new materials or in materials selection. In this study the mechanical properties which are important in materials selection in mechanical design are investigated. Two types of materials are analysed, aluminium alloys <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> but focus will be on the aluminium alloys. Thermodynamic analysis has been used to evaluate the effect of the microstructure. Solid solution hardening has been successfully modelled for both aluminium alloys <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> <b>and</b> follows the theories by Labusch and Nabarro. The precipitation hardening is most dominant for the hardenable aluminium alloys, but the non-hardenable alloys also increase their strength from precipitation hardening. The non-hardenable alloys are divided into tempers, which differ in the amount of strain hardening. This has also been modelled successfully. Combining these fundamental results with multiple regression, models for mechanical properties have been created. Separate models are developed for wrought aluminium alloys <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> For the aluminium alloys this includes the solid solution hardening and the precipitation hardening. For the <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> the thickness, nitrogen content and ferrite content are included together with the solid solution hardening. QC 2010112...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} preheat temperature and welding speed by a view point of microstructure of joining zone used by friction stir welding (FSW) between ductile cast irons <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> FSW conditions were carried out by change of tool rotation by 200, 400 and 600 rpm, preheat temperature by non-preheat, 573 and 773 K, and welding speed by 1 ～ 10 mm/s. As a result, microstructure of FCD 450 side became a pearlite structure changed by preheat condition. Also, stir zone (SZ) of FSW were crystallized the chill structure because of cast iron melted partially why SZ temperature exceeded the eutectic temperature. However, higher welding speed could inhibited crystallization and found the possibility of bonding between ductile cast irons <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

25|$|Household ammonia is a {{solution}} of NH3 in water (i.e., ammonium hydroxide) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, {{one of its most}} common uses is to clean glass, porcelain <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10% ammonia.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the torch {{reflected}} three famed areas of Australian culture: the boomerang, the Sydney Opera House, and {{the waters of the}} Pacific Ocean. The concept also reflected the elements of earth, fire, and water. This was achieved across three layers of the torch. The first, inner layer contains the fuel system and combustor, the second contains the fuel canister, and the outer layer is a specially textured aluminium shell. A combination of copper, brass, aluminium, <b>and</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> was used in its construction, and the fuel comprised 65 percent butane and 35 percent propane. In total 14,000 torches were produced.|$|E
