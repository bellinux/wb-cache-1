5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area.

5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E

Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the}} most eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly perfect circle.
