In this paper, four different commonly used depressants were adopted {{in order to}} investigate the effect of depressants on chalcopyrite index and to investigate their inhibition effects on chalcopyrite flotation. The experimental results indicate that, in the flotation system of natural pH of pulp, mixed reagent of xanthate and <b>aerofloat,</b> sodium hexametaphosphate has the best effect on chalcopyrite separation, and the dosage range is 1. 5 - 1. 5 kg/t, it can improve the concentrate recovery as well as concentrate grade. In the range of 0. 5 - 2. 5 kg/t, sodium silicate can improve the concentrate grade and concentrate recovery, but the amplitude is small. CMC can improve the concentrate grade while lower the concentrate recovery. The effects of dextrin on concentrate grade and concentrate recovery is not so obvious...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to find the foll owing paticulars. 1. The characteristics of the frothing power that is the froth-making power, and the froth stability of polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) solutions under the several experimental conditions, for example, the amount of air blown, amount of sample added and the flight of experimental time. 2. Performance of the estimation for the frothing power of PVA by the comparison with several flotation frothers on the market under the same experimental conditions. The polymerizations of PVA were 1055, 1200, 1670 and 2242. Flotation frothers on the market using in the comparison with PVA were Du Pont frother B- 24, Pine oil Yarmar-F, Nikko oil # 125, # 134 and Sumitomo <b>aerofloat</b> # 25 etc. In this experiment the author adopted the pneumatic methods and the shaking methods. The subject of the pneumatic method was bubble formation tube (dia 30 mm length 300 mm) attached in it the glass porosity filter, and pour in it 50 cc distilled water and the fixed amounts of sample solutions, and next get the foam layer by blowing the fixed amounts of airs through in the forgoing filter. The shaking method was shaking the plug tightened test tube (dia 30 mm length 200 mm) in which poured above waters and sample solutions {{at the rate of}} 50 [times/ 30 sec]. The conclusions of the experimental results may be summerised as follows:- 1. The frothing power of PVA was by no means inferior to flotation frothers. 2. The conditions of the frothing power of PVA on the flight of times under the pneumatic methods were exceeding alteration what is called "slugging" or "instability" layer. 3. The rankings of the frothing power was concided in the pneuinatic methods and shaking methods. 4. The froth stability of PVA was exceeding larger values cannot bear comparison with flotation frothers. ポバール(PVA) はポリビニルアルコール系繊維として広汎なる応用面をもつと共にその耐油性，耐久性，耐磨耗性等の特性により耐油管，パッキング，洗滌剤，膠着剤等多くの方面に使用され且つ量産の一途を辿つでいるものである。ところでPVAの水溶液は強い起泡性を示すことは衆知の通りである。幸い筆者は最近若干の試料を入手できたので，その起泡性を調べその様相の一端を把握した。従来起泡性即ち”泡立ち”(Frothing power) の表し方としては色々あるが，ここでは前報にもあげたごとく”泡立ち易さ”即ち泡沫生成度(Froth-making power) と”泡の消え難さ”即ち泡沫安定度(Froth stability) の二つにわけた。しかしこの外泡沫としての他の諸性質もすべてある程度起泡性に関係していることは当然であるがここでは触れないことにする。本報はPVAの泡沫生成度と安定度を種々の重合度，濃度その他の条件を変えて泡沫的特性をもとめ，ついで市販の浮選J用起泡剤の代表的なものと同じ条件で比較して一応PVAの起泡性の評価を行わんとするものである...|$|E
