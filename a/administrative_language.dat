5|$|From 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, {{the small}} Swedish {{community}} was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the <b>administrative</b> <b>language</b> and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden {{before the end}} of World War II, that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.|$|E
5|$|English {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the National Language Act of 1967. In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside Malaysian. Historically, English was {{the de facto}} <b>administrative</b> <b>language,</b> with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English, {{is a form of}} English derived from British English. Malaysian English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of non-standard Malay but has no power to issue compounds or fines to those who use improper Malay on their advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was a part}} of Sweden {{from the}} 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. Swedish was the sole <b>administrative</b> <b>language</b> until 1902 as well as the {{dominant}} language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest of Finland, though, with the same official status as Finnish. The country's public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M, as well a TV channel, Yle Fem.|$|E

5|$|The post-war Duchy of Courland and Semigallia {{south of}} the Düna (Daugava) river {{experienced}} a period of political stability based on the 1561 Treaty of Vilnius, later modified by the 1617 Formula regiminis and Statuta Curlandiæ, which granted indigenous nobles additional rights at the duke's expense. North of the Düna, Batory reduced the privileges Sigismund had granted the Duchy of Livonia, regarding the regained territories as the spoils of war. Riga's privileges had already been reduced by the Treaty of Drohiczyn in 1581. Polish gradually replaced German as the <b>administrative</b> <b>language</b> {{and the establishment of}} voivodeships reduced the Baltic German administration. The local clergy and the Jesuits in Livonia embraced the counter-reformation in a process assisted by Batory, who gave the Roman Catholic Church revenues and estates confiscated from Protestants as well as initiating a largely unsuccessful recruitment campaign for Catholic colonists. Despite these measures, the Livonian population did not convert en masse, while the Livonian estates in Poland–Lithuania were alienated.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ending}} of the Gupta Dynasty in {{northern}} India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary <b>administrative</b> <b>language</b> in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.|$|E

25|$|An early case of Russification {{took place}} in the 16th century in the conquered Khanate of Kazan (medieval Tatar state which {{occupied}} the territory of former Volga Bulgaria) and other Tatar areas.

25|$|After the Indian {{independence}} and partition {{of the country}} the states were reorganised based on the linguistic and other criteria and thus the divided areas of Kannada speaking population came together to form the present day Karnataka {{under the name of}} Mysore.

For instance, Spanish emigration to the New World was limited to settlers from Castile who were intended to act as soldiers or administrators. Mass immigration was not encouraged due to a labour shortage in Europe (of which Spain was the worst affected by a depopulation of its core territories in the 17th century).|$|R
50|$|While the {{linguistic}} leanings {{of the early}} Rashtrakutas (pre-8th century) has caused considerable debate, the history and language of the imperial Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been free of such confusion.

However this period was {{the very end of}} the classical era of literary Sanskrit and Prakrit. As such, from the Kavirajamarga of the 9th century, it is known that Kannada was popular from Kaveri river up to the Godavari river, an area covering large territory in modern Maharashtra.|$|R
