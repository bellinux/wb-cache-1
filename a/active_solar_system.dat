As in most countries, wind power development preceded solar power initially, due to the lower installation cost. Since solar power is not available during the night, and because wind power tends to be complementary to solar, a mix of both can be expected. Both require substantial storage to compensate for days with no wind and no sun. Batteries provide short term storage, and pumped hydroelectricity provides longer term storage.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The Boleyn home {{located in}} Portland Oregon (latitude 45 °) is {{evaluated}} based on monitoring data taken from 1977 to 1982. The Boleyn {{home is a}} two-story (plus basement) frame home. It takes benefit of passive solar gains and is equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> consists of a 429 ft² (39. 9 m²) collector with 3750 gallons (14400 liter) of water for thermal storage. The <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> and the monitoring equipment were installed by PGE (Portland General Electric Company). The performance {{of the building and}} of the <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> and the validity of models predicting parameters of the home and of the solar system are evaluated. Performance of the home: The Boleyn home is a very well insulated house with low infiltration rate and benefits from passive solar gains obtained from 96 ft 2 of glass area to the south. The Boleyn home is heated by four sources: passive solar gains, internal gains, <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> and backup system. Reduced transmission losses through the floor area to the basement heated by losses from the solar storage tanks contributes a significant amount of the overall gain from the <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of the active system: The design goal of the solar system to meet 50 % of the house heating requirements was exceeded. The performance of the Revere double-glazed collector did not deteriorate over time and matchs the manufacturer's data within 5 %. A significant amount of heat was lost through the storage tanks because insulation was lacking on the tanks around penetrations and around the pipes. Heat loss due to thermosyphoning was present before installation of a backf low check valve in the collector loop. The overall efficiency of the system was improved by reducing the pump power in the solar collection loop and installation of an improved backup system. Installation of a domestic hot water preheat tank reduced the domestic hot water load by 73 %. Validity of predictive tools: The design heat loss calculated by using the ASHRAE method matched the experimentally evaluated design heat loss within 6 %. The annual heating requirements predicted by the degree-day-method by ASHRAE and Calpas 3 were accurate within 12 % and 21 % respectively. A large cooling load caused by passive solar gains predicted by Calpas 3 did not occur at the Boleyn home. The Boleyns open the windows and accept higher indoor temperatures than predicted by Calpas 3. The active solar fraction predicted by F -chart was 66. 3 %. The experimentally evaluated value is 74. 5 %. The heat loss from the solar storage tanks was 3. 6 times higher than the prediction performed by PGE, which did not include losses from piping and uninsulated portions of the tank...|$|E

A preliminary design of a dual mode absorption generator was developed capable of using simultaneously heat from gas and solar. The performance of such a system was examined in three cities.

The Mg excesses correlate well with Al- 27 /Mg- 24 and in two cases they are found in high-purity separates of coarse-grained Al-rich minerals which tend to exclude Mg.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a key}} tool in achieving environmental sustainability. Due to its importance, it is a key arm of Sustainable Energy for All (SE 4 ALL). In buildings, energy efficiency can best be achieved {{by the use of}} less energy in the daily operation of buildings. This research analysed the suns potential in temperate buildings as a tool to lessen energy use. After analysing the weather data and buildings of the case study area, buildings oriented to the south were the best option for Nottingham. When the building fabric was modified for more heat gains, less energy was needed to heat up the buildings. Roofs of buildings were also oriented to the south and this received a lot of solar radiation. An <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> when placed on the roof generated a yearly total of 17, 486 kWh. With the average yearly energy demand of buildings in UK around 18, 000 kWh, this energy produce can be sustainable to an average home in the UK. Even though financial analysis should be done to conclude on profit, this gives a good sign.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of passive or <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> {{applications}} is not only high efficient collecting and storing of solar energy but effective distribution the heat around the building spaces as well. The main goal of this work is to analyse and compare two types of solar air collector integrated in an ecological, low-energy, one family building. The first one, is a large volume sunspace located on the south-west {{of the building and}} the second, is a small volume and flat solar panel on the roof. Both collectors are connected with particular rooms by a ventilation system. The components of this system include air flow gaps for natural ventilation and various devices for mechanical ventilation. Some components are controlled {{on the basis of the}} zone¿s air temperature. Numerical analyses have been conducted for selected two-week periods using hourly Polish weather data. The results show that during the selected, coldest winter period, the air temperature inside the collectors does not exceed 20 °C and there is no additional heat flow from the collectors to the rooms. Effective heat gains appear just from March to the end of the heating period. During this period, an additional fan is on and excess energy is transferred to the rooms not only by conduction but by convection as well. The presented results illustrate the differences in heating energy demand and thermal performance of the building. The utilisation of solar energy can reduce heating energy demand and decrease the number of heating hours. Finally the efficiency coefficient of the system was estimated as a function between solar energy gains and heating energy requirements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the lithopanspermia hypothesis in star forming groups and clusters, where {{the chances of}} biological material spreading from one solar system to another is greatly enhanced (relative to action in the field) due to the close proximity of the systems and lower relative velocities. These effects more than compensate for the reduced time spent in such crowded environments. This paper uses ∼ 300, 000 Monte Carlo scattering calculations to determine the cross sections 〈σcap 〉 for rocks to be captured by binaries and provides fitting formulae for other applications. We assess the odds of transfer {{as a function of}} the ejection speed veject and number N ⋆ of members in the birth aggregate. The odds of any given ejected meteroid being recaptured by another solar system are relatively low, about 1 in 10 3 − 10 6 over the expected range of ejection speeds and cluster sizes. Because the number of ejected rocks (with mass m> 10 kg) per system can be large, NR ∼ 10 16, virtually all solar systems are likely to share rocky ejecta with all of the other solar systems in their birth cluster. The number of ejected rocks that carry living microorganisms is much smaller and less certain, but we estimate that NB ∼ 10 7 rocks can be ejected from a biologically <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> For typical birth environments, the capture of life bearing rocks is expected to occur Nbio ≈ 10 – 16, 000 times per cluster (under favorable conditions), depending on the ejection speeds. Only a small fraction (fimp ∼ 10 − 4) of the captured rocks impact the surfaces of terrestrial planets, so that Nlps ≈ 10 − 3 − 1. 6 lithopanspermia events are expected (per cluster). Finally, we discuss the question of internal vs external seeding of clusters and the possibility of Earth seeding young clusters over its biologically active lifetime.
