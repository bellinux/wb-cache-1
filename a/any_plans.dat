Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.|$|R
5|$|The Android {{operating}} system was officially unveiled in November 2007 {{along with the}} founding of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA); a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. These companies included Google, along with HTC, a company who was at the time, one of the largest manufacturers of phones. While Google indicated in 2008 that several linux devices were being tested in preparation for the official public launch of Android, only one was to be released in the United States that year—the HTC Dream. Plans called for the Dream to be released on T-Mobile USA {{by the end of the}} year (with some reports suggesting October 2008), targeting the holiday shopping season. Sprint had worked with the OHA, but had not yet unveiled <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> to release an Android phone of its own, while Verizon Wireless and AT did not have <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> for Android devices yet at all.|$|E

This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left as originally constructed and there are not <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern was {{released}} on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E

Although the March 2012 {{issue of the}} magazine AirForces Monthly stated that the USMC intended to fly some of the ex-British Harrier IIs, instead of using them just for spare parts, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has since stated that the USMC has never had <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> to operate those Harriers.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} foil <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> for a coup d'état, the {{president}} {{took control of the}} military and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny's request or when they considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.|$|E
5|$|No {{information}} on the bridge survives from ancient sources. The first descriptions appear in European travellers' accounts from the 19thcentury.

Spratt and Edward Forbes, who visited the site two years later, describe it as having 25 arches. In 1882, an Austrian expedition, including Otto Benndorf, interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia (modern Antalya) to the east.

5|$|Despite this failure, Arab {{pressure}} gradually {{began to}} mount, {{especially after the}} sack of Laodicea Combusta in 770. The Byzantines were still capable of major counterstrokes and scored a few victories in the field, but in 782 the Caliphate mobilized its resources and launched a massive invasion under the Abbasid heir-apparent, Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), which forced the Empire into conceding a three-year truce and the payment of a heavy tribute. When warfare resumed in 785, and until {{the outbreak of the}} Abbasid civil war following Harun's death in 809, the Abbasids established and maintained a clear military supremacy, although vigorous Byzantine resistance prohibited <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> for outright conquest. Kamacha itself was surrendered to the Arabs by its Armenian garrison in 793, only to be recovered by the Byzantines in the years following Harun's death. It fell again in Muslim hands in 822, and was not finally taken by the Byzantines until 851.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumors of a {{three-dimensional}} Kid Icarus game for the Wii that was allegedly developed by the German American studio Factor 5.

In a 2010 interview, Yoshio Sakamoto was asked about a Kid Icarus game for the Wii, to which he replied that he was not aware of <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> to revive the franchise. A new series entry for the Nintendo 3DS, , was eventually revealed at the E3 2010 trade show and was released in 2012.

Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other teams}} either had similar {{knowledge}} or had pursued Bure, {{but there was}} confusion as to {{the legitimacy of the}} extra games. The Detroit Red Wings had asked league vice president Gil Stein about Bure's availability before their fifth-round pick, but were told he was not eligible. They later decided to select him with their sixth-round pick, 116th overall, and settle his eligibility later. The Canucks selected Bure three picks ahead of Detroit's turn. Meanwhile, Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith, claimed he made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation that would involve three years of transfer payments before Bure would be allowed to join the Jets; however Smith did not have <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> to draft Bure in 1989 as he believed he was ineligible.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} on November 11, 1926, along {{a series of}} existing state highways from Lansing southward toward Toledo. In 1930, the southern end was rerouted south of Somerset in rural northwestern Lenawee County to a course that ran directly south to the Ohio state line; the remainder was renumbered US223. Starting in the 1950s, the highway was reconfigured to bypass Mason and other communities, converting US127 into a freeway from Jackson to the Lansing area by the mid-1970s. When the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1999 to remove US27 from the state, US127 was to be extended northward from Lansing to Grayling as the replacement designation. This change was made in 2002, resulting in the current configuration of the highway in Michigan. The United States Congress has designated an additional Interstate Highway, {{to be part of}} I-73, that would replace most or all of US127 through Central and Southern Michigan, but <b>any</b> <b>plans</b> by MDOT to complete this highway were cancelled in 2001.|$|E
