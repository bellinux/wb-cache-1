40|$|In Web {{search and}} {{vertical}} search, recency ranking refers to retrieving and ranking documents by both relevance and freshness. <b>As</b> <b>impoverished</b> in-links and click information is the {{the biggest challenge}} for recency ranking, we advocate the use of Twitter data to address the challenge in this article.

The empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively improves a commercial search engine for both Web search ranking and tweet vertical ranking...|$|R
