5|$|As a result, {{there were}} a growing range of demands on the mounted police, and they {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy around what role the mounted police should play in the new towns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> became concerned that these were pulling in police manpower, {{at the expense of the}} wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to enforce the prostitution laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} {{force back to}} defend the airstrip. As {{this was not an}} Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. They responded by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, the North-West Rebellion {{broke out}} along the North Saskatchewan River valley. Driven by a {{combination}} of political and economic issues, Louis Riel and his Métis followers intended to form a provisional government, gain the support of the Cree First Nation, defeat the mounted police and seize the region, forcing the Canadian government to the negotiation table. There had been worries among the police about potential instability since the previous fall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> had increased its presence in the area over the winter. As tensions rose, Commissioner Irvine, who had replaced Macleod in 1880 after accusations of financial mismanagement, began to mobilise any spare police manpower in Regina, bringing the force up to an operational strength of 562.|$|E

5|$|In May 1794, a large French fleet put to sea {{to ensure}} the safety of an American grain convoy and was intercepted far out in the Atlantic at the Glorious First of June by the British Channel Fleet, the most {{powerful}} of the Royal Navy's fleets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> assigned to restrict French movements from Brest. The French suffered a serious defeat, losing seven ships, but managed to retire in good order and saved the grain convoy. Later in June 1794 the British Fleet again put to sea, but was caught in a storm and many ships were badly damaged. Its commander Lord Howe retired with his fleet to the anchorage in Torbay and thus there was no British fleet at sea in late October when a powerful French squadron sailed from Brest with the intention of attacking a large merchant convoy sailing from Lisbon to Britain. The force, under the command of Contre-amiral Joseph-Marie Nielly, consisted of the 74-gun ships of the line Marat, Tigre, Droits de l'Homme, Pelletier and Jean-Bart with the frigates Charente, Fraternité, Gentille and the corvette Papillon.|$|E

5|$|In the south, Jordanian {{artillery}} shelling {{prevented the}} Israelis from erecting another pontoon bridge {{on the site}} of the Abdullah bridge, halting the Israeli advance there. After crossing the Allenby Bridge, the 7th Armored Brigade spread in three directions from Shuna: One or more companies drove north to Karameh. An infantry battalion and a tank battalion moved east to block the Salt road. And another infantry battalion moved south to assist the force trying to break across the Abdullah Bridge. Meanwhile, the force that crossed the Damia Bridge established itself on the east bank. Engineers began constructing a new bridge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> advanced east to the Musri junction. After taking Musri, their intended advance south to Karameh was repulsed by the northern brigade of the Jordanian 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|Leopold, however, {{reneged on}} his {{humanitarian}} promises, and instead brutally exploited the locals {{and the land}} to gain what profit he could. Initially, the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo. As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s, it quickly surpassed ivory as a profitable export, which allowed the colony to become extremely profitable for the first time. Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> Publique, the state's private army, was used to force locals to collect it. In some cases, Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off. The system was immensely profitable, but {{the population of the}} Congo is thought to have been reduced by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold's control.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 2010, CBC News Network's The Fifth Estate {{broadcast}} {{a documentary about}} the case titled Out of Control. In the documentary, reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen-year-old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing crabapples at the mailman. Smith was placed in solitary confinement after disruptive behaviour on her first day. Her initial one-month sentence would last almost four years, entirely in isolation, until her death in 2007. Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness; guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed.|$|E

The remainder of the 24th Brigade was transported across the bay during the last week of June, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> advanced inland to capture the town of Beaufort which was defended by between 800 and 1,000 Japanese personnel. Following some heavy fighting, the town was secured on 28 June. The brigade then advanced further inland to Papar in early July. Later that month the 9th Division's commander, Major General George Wootten, relieved Norman from command over an incident in which he had lost control of the 2/28th Battalion during the fighting on Labuan. Following the announcement of the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945 and the formal ceremony held in Tokyo Bay on 2 September, the commander of the 37th Army, Major General Masao Baba, surrendered to Wootten on 10 September at a ceremony conducted at the 9th Division's headquarters on Labuan.|$|E
