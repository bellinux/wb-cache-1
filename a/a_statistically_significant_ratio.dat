40|$|Over the Past {{two and a}} {{half years}} banks have failed at the fastest pace since the Great Depression. These rapidly {{mounting}} bank failures have rekindled a debate surrounding the use of fair value accounting, with many arguing that fair value has exacerbated the severity of the recent financial crisis through asset devaluation and the forced sale of assets in an effort to meet capital requirements. This paper seeks to test if an entity’s exposure to fair value which includes assets available-for-sale, trading assets, and loans held-for-sale as a percent of total assets increases the probability of bank failure through testing different prediction models of bank failure that use ratios generated from publicly available Call Report data. Two models are generated from these ratios, one to determine the significance of an entity’s fair value exposure in predicting risk of failure, and the other to determine if a better model can be generated in the absence of the Fair Value Exposure/Total Assets ratio. The first model shows that Fair Value Exposure/Total Assets is <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratio,</b> and that the model employing Fair Value Exposure/Total Assets has greater bank failure predictive power than the second model that excludes this ratio. Contrary to expectations, the study determines that greater fair value exposure actually decreases a bank’s risk of failure, rather than increases it. A number of possibilities as to why this may be are presented in the conclusion of the paper...|$|E

We planned to to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis spp. in patients who applied to the same internal medicine-gastroenterology clinic with or without gastrointestinal complaints to reveal the association of this parasite with diagnosed IBS and IBD. Methods A total of 2334 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms composed the study group, which included 335 patients with diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease and 877 with irritable bowel syndrome. Patients without any gastrointestinal symptoms or disease (n[*]=[*] 192) composed the control group. Parasite presence was investigated by applying native-Lugol and formol ethyl acetate concentration to stool specimens, and trichrome staining method in suspicious cases. Results Blastocystis spp. was detected in 134 patients (5. 74 %) in the study group and 6 (3. 12 %) {{in the control group}} (p[*]=[*] 0. 128). In the study group, Blastocystis spp. was detected at frequencies of 8. 7 % in ulcerative colitis (24 / 276), 6. 78 % in Crohn’s disease (4 / 59), 5. 82 % in irritable bowel syndrome (51 / 877), and 4. 9 % in the remaining patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (55 / 1122). Blastocystis spp. was detected at <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratio</b> in the inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 2. 824; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 149 - 6. 944; p[*]=[*] 0. 019) and ulcerative colitis (OR[*]=[*] 2. 952; 95 % CI: 1. 183 - 7. 367; p[*]=[*] 0. 016) patients within this group compared to controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the control group and Crohn’s disease or irritable bowel syndrome patients in terms Blastocystis spp. frequency (p[*]=[*] 0. 251, p[*]=[*] 0. 133). Conclusions Blastocystosis was more frequent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially those with ulcerative colitis. Although symptomatic irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease patients had higher rates of Blastocystis spp. infection, the differences were not significant when compared to controls. </p...|$|E

While facilities have been implemented to address this problem they are underused due to a lack in help-seeking behavior. This study investigates factors related to the help-seeking behavior of mothers for children with acute {{respiratory infection}} using data from the 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey. Data on 11, 030 children aged 0 - 59 months obtained through interviewing women aged 15 - 49 years throughout Ethiopia was available. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine which factors are related to help-seeking behavior for acute respiratory infection. In the two weeks prior to the survey, 773 (7 %) of the children were reported to have symptoms of acute respiratory infection while treatment was sought for only 209 (27. 2 %). The odds ratio for acute respiratory infection was 1. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 0) for rural residence with only 25. 2 % of these mothers seeking help compared to 46. 4 % for mothers with an urban residence. Smaller family size, younger mothers' age and having had prenatal care had <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> greater than 1 for both urban and rural residences. Highest wealth index had <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> greater than 1 for rural residence only, whereas primary education or higher had <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> greater than 1 for urban residence. Children from rural areas are more at risk for acute respiratory infection while their mothers are less likely to seek help. Nevertheless, there is also underuse of available services in urban areas. Interventions should target mothers with less education and wealth and older mothers. Expanding prenatal care among these groups would encourage a better use of available facilities and subsequently better care for their children...|$|R

Cell proliferation and cell death are opposing processes in tumor growth, with tumor progression reflecting {{the balance between}} proliferating and apoptotic cells. We investigated cell proliferation and cell death using MIB- 1 staining and nick-end labeling in 13 germinomas in comparison with 11 glioblastomas. Expression of BAX and Bcl- 2, which regulate apoptosis, were studied by immunohistochemistry. Although germinomas showed strong MIB- 1 immunostaining similar to that seen in glioblastomas, germinomas included significantly more apoptotic cells. The ratio of apoptotic ratio to MIB- 1 labeling index for germinomas was 72. 9 +/- 36. 9 (mean +/- SD), <b>a</b> higher, <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratio</b> as compared with glioblastomas (14. 5 +/- 11. 2; P < 0. 01).

40|$|Introduction Taller stature is {{associated}} with greater health potential reflected by reduced risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and depression. Previous studies demonstrated that the reduced CHD and depression risks associated with tall stature were eliminated by financial disadvantage in adult life. Hypothesis The reduced risk of depression, defined as low mood, associated with taller stature is eliminated by adult financial adversity. This study also attempts to replicate earlier findings, that the reduced risk of CHD associated with taller stature is eliminated by adult financial adversity. Methods The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System is an ongoing survey {{of the adult population}} of the US conducted by state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, providing a representative sample of 45, 210 adults resident in USA in 2004 with data on low mood and CHD. Low mood was defined by self-reported low mood for more than 15 days in the previous month and CHD by a diagnosis of angina or coronary heart disease. Short stature was defined as the lower 20 % of sex-standardised heights and economic disadvantage as household income below $ 15, 000 per annum. Results Tall stature was associated with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> reduced risk for low mood in the entire population. After stratification by economic disadvantage, taller individuals in the higher income stratum maintained <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> reduced risk of low mood, with an odds ratio (and 95 % confidence interval) of 0. 90 (0. 90, 0. 91) after adjustment for potential confounding factors and application of the survey weighting.

Material and Methods: The characteristic and pathologic parameters of 280 patients operated on for nonmetastatic colorectal cancer at our service were recorded retrospectively. Patients were stratified into 4 groups according to the LNR quartiles of 1 / 12, ¼, ½ and 1. Distribution of demographic data and probability tables were made by ANOVA and χ 2 tests. The cumulative survival ratios for LNR, N stage and TNM stage were calculated by the Kaplan Meier method and survival difference between groups were calculated by the log rank test. Results: There was <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> correlation <b>ratio</b> between metastatic lymph node count and LNR. In 173 of all patients (61. 8 %) fewer than 12 lymph nodes were harvested. One hundred sixtysix (59. 3 %) patients were evaluated as N 0, 79 (28. 2 %) were N 1 and 35 (12. 5 %) were N 2.

To {{gain insight into}} {{the underlying causes of}} severe lung diseases, we aimed at comparing the airway microbiota detected in sputum of CF patients with stable lung function (S) versus those with a substantial decline in lung function (SD). Microbiota composition was investigated by using culture-based and culture-independent methods, and by performing multivariate and statistical analyses. Culture-based methods identified some microbial species associated with a worse lung function, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida albicans, but only the presence of S. pneumoniae and R. mucilaginosa was found to be associated with increased severe decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity than that detected by culture-based methods. Molecular signatures with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> for SD status were detected, and classified as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Shewanella, while for other Terminal Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) no species assignation was achieved.

40|$|Iversen et al. have {{recently}} dealt in this Journal, {{with the effects}} of total cholesterol (TC) levels on cardiovascular risk according to age in a healthy population from the Copenhagen City Heart Study. They conclude that the association between high TC and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) event rate declines progressively with advancing age and is no more valid above 80 years [1]. This thorough survey considers more than 10, 000 men and women before statin introduction in Denmark; its conclusions are in agreement with other cohort investigations but rely simply on total cholesterol and not on other useful lipid parameters. On the other hand data from a recent meta-analysis (61 prospective observational studies), consisting of almost 900, 000 adults without previous disease, disclose that 1 mmol/L lower TC was associated with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> hazard <b>ratio</b> of 0. 72, 0. 82 and 0. 85 lower CHD mortality in both sexes at ages 60 – 69, 70 – 79 and 80 – 89 years, respectively, and that HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and TC to HDL-C ratio are more informative parameter than total cholesterol alone [2]. We agree with the latter conclusions, pointing out that the EPESE Study related the apparent adverse effects associated with low TC levels in very old patients (average baseline age of 79) to comorbidity and frailty, and that adjusting for potential confounders (among which HDL-C) restored the direct relationship between TC and CHD in this population characterized by a heterogeneous health state [3]. Also the experience matured by our study-group suggests a prominent effect related to HDL-C [4], showing that free-living healthy octo-nonagenarians (free from CHD and stroke) are not characterized by high HDL-C or low LDL-C levels, but by a very low prevalence of low HDL-C (3. 9...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{predictive}} value of topoisomerase-II? (topo-II) has been evaluated in advanced {{breast cancer patients}} randomly treated with single-agent doxorubicin or docetaxel. Experimental design: Primary tumor samples from patients enrolled in a randomized, phase III clinical trial comparing single-agent doxorubicin (75 mg/m 2 q 3 wks) with docetaxel (100 mg/m 2 q 3 wks) were collected and topo-II status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (clone KiS 1). Results: Topo-II status was evaluated in 108 samples, 55 (51 %) in the doxorubicin arm and 53 (49 %) in the docetaxel arm. An increment of 10 % in cells expressing topo-II is associated with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> (OR; 95 % confidence interval) of 1. 09 (1. 03 – 1. 15; P = 0. 002) for overall response to doxorubicin versus 1. 002 (0. 94 – 1. 07; P = 0. 95) in the docetaxel arm. With increasing topo-II, the favorable OR for overall response to docetaxel compared with doxorubicin decreases to become not significant in patients with topo-II tumor content > 10 %. In a multivariate analysis, (a) HER- 2 status seems positively correlated with overall response to chemotherapy (OR, 2. 34; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 87 – 6. 27; P = 0. 09). (b) Overall response to doxorubicin is significantly lower than overall response to docetaxel (OR, 0. 17; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 04 – 0. 64; P = 0. 009) but with a significant interaction term for doxorubicin-treated patients with topo-II tumor content > 10 % (OR, 8. 31; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 86 – 37. 03; P = 0. 05).

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} whether wall growth during aneurysm development spares the aortic wall between the intercostal or lumbar arteries or, alternatively, is uniform around the circumference. MethodsComputed tomography scans of 155 patients with aortic aneurysms (40 thoracic, 50 thoracoabdominal, and 65 abdominal) {{in a single}} hospital of a large academic institution were retrospectively inspected. Computed tomography studies of 100 control subjects (40 thoracic and 60 abdominal) were also reviewed. In all 255 patients, {{the ratio of the}} arc length between the origins of the intercostal or lumbar arteries (interbranch arc length) to the remainder of the aortic residual circumference was calculated. These ratios were compared between all subjects with aneurysms and the controls at each vertebral body level and between those with thoracic or thoracoabdominal or abdominal aneurysms and controls at each vertebral body level. ResultsInterbranch arc lengths and residual aortic circumferences were larger in aneurysm patients than in control subjects, but the differences were <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> only at T 4 and from T 8 to L 4 (P =. 009 to P <. 001) and from T 4 to L 4 (P <. 001), respectively. The ratio of interbranch arc length to residual circumference in aneurysmal aortas was significantly smaller than that in controls at 12 out of 13 levels from T 4 to L 4 (P =. 004 to P <. 001). There was <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> smaller <b>ratio</b> at 8 out of 9 levels for thoracic aneurysms (P =. 006 to P <. 001), 12 out of 13 levels for thoracoabdominal aneurysms (P =. 008 to P <. 001), and 3 out of 4 levels for abdominal aneurysms compared with controls (P =. 006 to P <. 001). ConclusionsWall growth in aortic aneurysms is asymmetric, with greater aneurysmal growth in the anterior aorta wall and relative sparing of the portion of aortic wall between the intercostal or lumbar arteries. The mechanisms effecting this asymmetric growth have not been fully characterized...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{performed}} a prospective study of sneezes from orthopaedic registrars {{to assess the}} potential for intra-operative contamination from a masked surgeon, and to determine if head position can alter the potential for contamination. Type of Study: Prospective controlled trial. Methods: Four orthopaedic registrars from the Gold Coast Hospital each inhaled pepper to precipitate a sneeze. Cultures were taken with and without standard Smith & Nephew頳urgical masks, in positions directly in front and {{to the sides of}} a masked registrar. The process was repeated three times for each registrar. A control plate was left exposed to the atmosphere. A control plate and sneeze plate was cultured on blood agar. Three masks were subsequently swabbed to exclude contamination from the masks. Results: 2 / 24 (8. 33 %) of the side with mask cultures returned significant bacterial growths. Also, 1 / 12 (8. 33 %) of the front with mask cultures returned significant growths. In addition, 9 / 12 (75 %) of the direct sneezes resulted in significant bacterial counts. The control plate failed to return any growth. Subsequent culture of the exterior of three surgical masks failed to yield significant growth. There was <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> of 0. 03 comparing the front and side group with the unmasked direct group. There was no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> difference comparing front and side sneeze growth. Conclusions: While the use of surgical face masks significantly reduces bacterial counts following a sneeze, it fails to eliminate the potential for surgical field contamination completely. The fact that significant bacterial counts can be returned from direct culture through a mask and to the sides of a mask suggests that head position is irrelevant and contamination is possible in any direction. It is, therefore, suggested that, if possible, a sneezing surgeon distances himself/herself as much as possible from the sterile field. We also recommend following a sneeze; surgeons should re-gown and glove, given the risk of contamination of the sterile field. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate regional differences in injury incidence in men's professional football in Europe. A nine-season prospective cohort study was carried out between 2001 – 2002 and 2009 – 2010 involving 1357 players in 25 teams from nine countries. Teams were categorized into different regions according to the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system. Teams from the northern parts of Europe (n[*]=[*] 20) had higher incidences of injury overall [rate ratio 1. 12, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 to 1. 20], training injury (rate ratio 1. 16, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 27), and severe injury (rate ratio 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 1. 52), all <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> compared to teams from more southern parts (n[*] =[*] 5). In contrast, the anterior cruciate ligament injury incidence was lower in the northern European teams with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> difference (rate <b>ratio</b> 0. 43, 95 % CI 0. 25 to 0. 77), especially for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury (rate ratio 0. 19, 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 39). In conclusion, this study suggests that there are regional differences in injury incidence of European professional football. However, further studies are needed to identify the underlying causes.

The {{assessment}} of the clinical significance of chondroitin sulfate in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) {{for the detection of}} the relationship between chondroitin sulfate (CS) structure and disease. Methods. Healthy control (n= 15), type 2 diabetic patients with normalbuminuria (n= 12), and patients with microalbuminuria (n= 13) were enrolled in the study. Total sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) concentration in the first morning urine was evaluated by 1, 9 -dimethylmethylene blue method and the composition was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Urinary chondroitin sulfate was quantified by a combination of treatment with specific lyase digestions and separation of products by SAX-HPLC. Results: GAGs concentration significantly increased in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria compared to diabetic patients with normalbuminuria. Qualitative analysis of urinary GAGs revealed the presence of chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and low-sulphated chondroitin sulphate-protein complex (LSC-PG). There was a decrease in CS and an increase in LSC-PG in the urine of patients with diabetes compared to healthy controls. Moreover, in diabetic patients, chondroitin sulfate contains more 6 -sulfated disaccharide and less 4 -sulfated disaccharide. There was <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> difference in <b>ratio</b> of 6 -sulfated disaccharide to 4 -sulfated disaccharide among the three groups.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsHikaru H. PetersonThe {{prevalence}} of obesity and overweight has heightened over the last 40 years. Over {{two thirds of the}} US adult population is overweight or obese. Further, 18 % of adolescents, ages 12 to 19, are obese, which is an increase of over 13 % since the late 1970 ’s. Food environment and peer influence have been emerging areas of study and are thought to be catalysts to unhealthy eating choices. College students present a unique opportunity to look at the impact of a changing food environment, including changes in peer groups. This study is concerned with how students’ peers impact their food consumption and ultimately weight. College freshmen were recruited during their first month on campus at Kansas State University. The students participated in a year-long, three-part study to track their eating habits, weight and height. The students’ parents were also asked to participate by filling out a survey on eating habits. The students also asked one friend they ate with {{at least once a week}} to fill out a food record with them. The collected information was transformed into daily average calories for each of six food groups and for macronutrients. A peer ratio was created from the parents and friends calorie intakes to determine the similarity in consumption by each food group or macronutrient. A system of equations was specified and estimated for both food groups and macronutrients. For the food group model, beverages were the only food group with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> peer <b>ratio</b> term. The coefficient on the ratio was positive, indicating that students would consume more calories from beverages, as their college friends consumed more calories from beverages relative to the students’ parents at home. In the macronutrient model, protein had <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> and positive peer ratio. An examination of the impacts of predicted calories consumed from food groups, along with other individual characteristics, on student’s BMI in the spring term, indicated that increasing snack consumption led to an increase in BMI while increasing bread consumption caused a decrease. Eating more meals at the university dining center also increased BMI. An analysis for the predicted macronutrient values revealed a similar relationship with eating more meals at the dining center, but the predicted macronutrients did not have <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> impacts on BMI...|$|R
40|$|Background: Statins {{have been}} shown {{to reduce the risk of}} all-cause {{mortality}} among individuals with clinical history of coronary heart disease. However, it remains uncertain whether statins have similar mortality benefit in a high-risk primary prevention setting. Notably, all systematic reviews to date included trials that in part incorporated participants with prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. Our objective was to reliably determine if statin therapy reduces all-cause mortality among intermediate to high-risk individuals without a history of CVD. Data Sources: Trials were identified through computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases (January 1970 -May 2009) using terms related to statins, clinical trials, and cardiovascular end points and through bibliographies of retrieved studies. Study Selection: Prospective, randomized controlled trials of statin therapy performed in individuals free from CVD at baseline and that reported details, or could supply data, on all-cause mortality. Data Extraction: Relevant data including the number of patients randomized, mean duration of follow-up, and the number of incident deaths were obtained from the principal publication or by correspondence with the investigators. Data Synthesis: Data were combined from 11 studies and effect estimates were pooled using a random-effects model meta-analysis, with heterogeneity assessed with the I- 2 statistic. Data were available on 65 229 participants followed for approximately 244 000 person-years, during which 2793 deaths occurred.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} impact of the blood {{pressure}} (BP) profile on cardiovascular risk in the Medical Research Council (UK) elderly trial; investigate whether the effects of hypertensive drugs in reducing event rates are solely a product of systolic pressure reduction. Methods: Using longitudinal BP data from 4396 hypertensive patients, the general trend over time was estimated using a first-stage multilevel model. We then investigated how BP acted alongside other BP-related covariates in a second-stage 'time-to-event' statistical model, assessing risk for stroke events and coronary heart disease (CHD). Differences in outcome prediction between diuretic, β-blocker and placebo treatment arms were investigated. Results: The β-blocker arm experienced comparatively poor control of current SBP, episodic peaks and variability in BP levels. After adjusting for the mean level, variability in SBP over time was significant: risk ratio was 1. 15 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 01 - 1. 31] across all patients for stroke events. The risk ratio for current SBP was 1. 36 (95 % CI: 1. 16 - 1. 58). Current DBP and variability in DBP also predicted stroke independently: risk ratios was 1. 43 and 1. 18, respectively. The risk factors exhibited weaker associations with CHD risk; only the highest measured value and variability in SBP showed <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> association: risk <b>ratios</b> were 1. 26 and 1. 16, respectively. CONCLUSION:: Individual risk characterization could be augmented with additional prognostic information, besides current SBP, including current diastolic pressure, temporal variability over and above general trends and historical measurements. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

We evaluated {{the frequency with which}} these factors were present in 720 patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer and in 720 matched controls. All subjects were interviewed personally and in detail about their clinical history. Cholelithiasis was present in 126 patients with pancreatic cancer (17. 5 %) and in 95 controls (13. 2 %), constituting <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> association (odds <b>ratio,</b> 1. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 - 1. 86); however, considering only the patients and controls in whom the diagnosis of cholelithiasis was made more than one year before cancer diagnosis or interview, the association was no longer <b>significant</b> (odds <b>ratio,</b> 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 75 - 1. 44). Cholecystectomy had been performed in 93 patients with pancreatic cancer (12. 9 %) and in 71 controls (9. 9 %). When all subjects were considered, the odds ratio was mildly, although not significantly, increased (odds ratio, 1. 35; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 97 - 1. 87); when only subjects who underwent cholecystectomy one year or more before the cancer diagnosis or interview were considered, the odds ratio fell to unity.

40|$|Stress induces {{autoimmune}} disorders by affecting the immune response modulation. Recent {{studies have shown}} that shift work stress may enhance the onset of the autoimmune Graves hyperthyroidism. On the other hand, the possible association between occupational stress and autoimmune hypothyroidism has not yet been investigated. In order to detect the possible association between shift work and subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism we investigated the prevalence of isolated anti-peroxidase thyroid (TPO) autoantibodies in 220 shift workers and in 422 day-time workers. Subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism was diagnosed by the concomitant presence of high anti-TPO values and TSH levels higher than 2. 51 mU/l. Anti TPO antibodies were measured by chemiluminescent technology (Advia Centaur) (a value above 60 IU/l was considered altered). Subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 7. 7 percent shift workers and in 3. 8 percent day-time workers with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> difference: Odds <b>Ratio</b> (OR) 2. 12, 95 percent Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 05 to 4. 29; p= 0. 03.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{observations}} {{have addressed}} a decreased male:female ratio associated with smoking. Our {{aim was to}} assess whether this effect is observed at the spermatozoa or at the early embryo development. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed smoking intake habits of 56 couples included in our preimplantation gen-etic diagnosis (PGD) program. Three groups were established according to male or female cigarette consumption per day: non-smokers, smokers (1 – 19 cigarettes per day) and heavy smokers ($ 20 cigarettes per day). Fluor-escence in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on ejaculated sperm samples to analyse chromosomes X and Y. On day 3, embryos were also analysed. Additionally, sperm samples from four heavy smoking and four non-smoking donors were prospectively analysed before and after capacitation. RESULTS: FISH on spermatozoa revealed no statistical differences in the Y:X ratio between the three groups. However, in the PGD study, in male heavy smokers, the XY:XX embryo ratio was decreased compared with non-smokers (22 : 47 versus 80 : 71; P 5 0. 0057). The smoking condition of the female partner had no significant effect on embryo XY:XX ratio, but for non-smoking females with a heavy smoking partner, the ratio was decreased (P 5 0. 0018) compared with non-smoking males. In heavy smoking donors a decreased of Y:X ratio was observed after swim-up with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> difference of <b>ratios</b> (P 5 0. 021). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking habits of males {{do not have an}} effect on the percentage of X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa on ejaculated samples. However, male heavy smokers produce an increased incidence of female embryos that could be related to an enrichment of X spermatozoa after swim-up in patients with high tobacco consumption.

40|$|Abstract Background Antivirals play a {{critical}} role in the prevention and the management of influenza. One class of antivirals, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), is effective against all human influenza viruses. Currently there are two NAI drugs which are licensed worldwide: oseltamivir (Tamiflu ®) and zanamivir (Relenza ®); and two drugs which have received recent approval in Japan: peramivir and laninamivir. Until recently, the prevalence of antiviral resistance has been relatively low. However, almost all seasonal H 1 N 1 strains that circulated in 2008 - 09 were resistant to oseltamivir whereas about 1 % of tested 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 viruses were found to be resistant to oseltamivir. To date, no studies have demonstrated widespread resistance to zanamivir. It seems likely that the literature on antiviral resistance associated with oseltamivir as well as zanamivir is now sufficiently comprehensive to warrant a systematic review. The primary objectives were to systematically review the literature to determine the incidence of resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir in different population groups as well as assess the clinical consequences of antiviral resistance. Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE without language restrictions in September 2010 to identify studies reporting incidence of resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. We used forest plots and meta-analysis of incidence of antiviral resistance associated with the three NAIs. Subgroup analyses were done across a number of population groups. Meta-analysis was also performed to evaluate associations between antiviral resistance and clinical complications and symptoms. Results We identified 19 studies reporting incidence of antiviral resistance. Meta-analysis of 15 studies yielded a pooled incidence rate for oseltamivir resistance of 2. 6 % (95 %CI 0. 7 % to 5. 5 %). The incidence rate for all zanamivir resistance studies was 0 %. Only one study measured incidence of antiviral resistance among subjects given peramivir and was reported to be 0 %. Subgroup analyses detected higher incidence rates among influenza A patients, especially for H 1 N 1 subtype influenza. Considerable heterogeneity between studies precluded definite inferences about subgroup results for immunocompromised patients, in-patients, and children. A meta-analysis of 4 studies reporting association between oseltamivir-resistance and pneumonia yielded <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> risk <b>ratio</b> of 4. 2 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 13. 1, p = 0. 02). Oseltamivir-resistance was not statistically significantly associated with other clinical complications and symptoms. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that that a substantial number of patients may become oseltamivir-resistant as a result of oseltamivir use, and that oseltamivir resistance may be significantly associated with pneumonia. In contrast, zanamivir resistance has been rarely reported to date. </p...|$|R
