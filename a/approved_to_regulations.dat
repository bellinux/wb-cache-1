Law 18/2001 granted Aceh special autonomy and included authority for Aceh to establish a system of Shari'a as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, national civil and criminal law. Before it could take effect, the law required the provincial legislature <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> local <b>regulations</b> ("qanun") incorporating Shari'a precepts into the legal code. Law 18/2001 states that the Shari'a courts would be [...] "free from outside influence by any side." [...] Article 25(3) states that the authority of the court will only apply to Muslims.

40|$|The British Parliament has {{recently}} <b>approved</b> <b>regulations</b> <b>to</b> allow techniques ‘to prevent {{the transmission of}} serious mitochondrial disease from a mother to her child’. The regulations term these techniques ‘mitochondrial donation’, but in the popular media, the issue has been discussed {{under the heading of}} ‘three parent’ babies or ‘three parent’ embryos. This paper examines the language of the debate, with particular reference to one of the techniques approved. It concludes that the terminology of ‘mitochondrial donation’ is scientifically inaccurate and ethically misleading, while the popular media description of ‘three parent’ embryos is broadly accurate, at least for one technique. This latter phrase also has the great merit, from an ethical perspective, of drawing attention to the ‘other woman’, the egg donor. She takes risks with her health in order to provide the egg which supplies the body of the embryo. Without her, this embryo simply would not exist...|$|R
50|$|Connecticut {{remains the}} only state in the United States to {{disallow}} the construction of utility-scale wind turbines. The state's {{two and a half}} year old ban on wind power was enacted in 2011, ostensibly to provide time for the Siting Council <b>to</b> enact <b>regulations</b> governing the siting of wind turbines in the state. Those regulations were written in 2012 to address health and safety issues related to wind power, such as maximum noise levels and distances from neighboring properties, but the legislative committee tasked with approving state agency regulations has repeatedly refused <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> the <b>regulations.</b> On November 26, 2013 the Connecticut General Assembly's Regulation Review Committee, for the fourth time since 2012, blocked the Connecticut Siting Council's Regulations that would have ended the state's ban on new wind power projects. The committee, led by co-chairman State Representative Selim Noujaim, forced the Siting Council to withdraw its proposal. This ban stands in stark contrast to Connecticut’s renewable energy laws requiring utilities to purchase 27% clean electricity (23% renewable) by the year 2020.|$|R
