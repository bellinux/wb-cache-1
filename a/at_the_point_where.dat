5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised {{in the sixteenth century}} by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|On 6August1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A), {{with the}} 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as {{chairman}} and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23September1868. The new line {{was connected to the}} Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.|$|E

5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{started at}} a lock {{constructed}} {{on the old}} course of the River Brue, which had been bypassed by a new cut in 1801 and filled in. It then followed {{the course of the}} Brue to Cripps Bridge, after which it followed the Cripps River to Gold Corner. The first part of the Cripps River was originally part of a loop on the River Brue, which was bypassed by a new cut made under the 1801 act. Gold Corner is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the Huntspill River, the Cripps River and the South Drain meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{county town}} of Norfolk, Norwich {{is a city}} on the River Wensum in the East of England. Its origins are unclear, but by the reign of King Æthelstan (924–939) the city was a major trading centre {{and one of the}} most {{important}} boroughs in England. The Anglo-Saxon settlement was centred around Tombland, a large open space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the roads into Norwich converged. The plain of Tombland was the site of Norwich's market.|$|E

40|$|Two {{teachers}} and a parent used three basic multiple baseline designs {{to investigate the}} effects of systematic reinforcement and punishment procedures in <b>the</b> classroom and <b>at</b> home. (1) A fifth-grade teacher concurrently measured the same behavior (tardiness) in three stimulus situations (after morning, noon, and afternoon recesses). Posting the names of pupils on a chart titled “Today's Patriots” was made contingent on being on time after the noon recess, then successively also the morning and afternoon recesses. Tardiness was reduced to near zero rates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> contingencies were applied. (2) A highschool teacher recorded the same behavior (daily French-quiz grades) of three students. She then successively applied the same consequences (staying after school for individual tutoring for D and F grades) for each student. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> contingency was applied, D and F grades were eliminated. (3) A mother concurrently measured three different behaviors (clarinet practice, Campfire project work, reading) of her 10 -yr-old daughter. She successively applied the same contingency (going to bed early) for less than 30 min spent engaged in one after another of the behaviors. Marked increases in the behaviors were observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> contingency was applied...|$|R
50|$|Scipio also {{engineered}} {{the isolation of}} the city from the Duero. He towered <b>the</b> river <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> it entered and exited the city and strung a cable across, with blades, to prevent both boats and swimmers from leaving or entering the city.|$|R
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been {{for the use of the}} castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the primary route to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the road}} becomes East 4th Street and heads north-{{northwest}} across the Christina River on a drawbridge. US 13/DE 9 curves northwest and passes under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line, {{at which point}} northbound US 13 splits from the road by turning northeast on North Church Street at the crossing of a railroad spur. A block later, the concurrency between DE 9 and southbound US 13 ends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> southbound US 13 joins the road from North Spruce Street. DE 9 continues northwest through residential and commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, entering downtown Wilmington. Here, it intersects US 13 Bus., which is routed on the one-way pair of North Walnut Street northbound and North King Street southbound. In between these two streets, the road runs {{to the south of}} the New Castle County Court House.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopean stairs {{can also}} form at <b>points</b> <b>where</b> {{tributary}} glaciers feed into larger central glaciers.

5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Pomona Docks {{have also}} been filled in except for the still intact No. 3 Dock, and are largely derelict. A lock at No. 3 Dock connects it to the nearby Bridgewater Canal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the two canals run in parallel. The western four docks have been {{converted}} into the Salford Quays development; ships using the Manchester Ship Canal now dock at various places along the canal side such as Mode Wheel (Salford), Trafford Park, and Ellesmere Port. Most ships have to terminate at Salford Quays, although vessels capable of passing under Trafford Road swing bridge (permanently closed in 1992) can continue up the River Irwell to Hunts Bank, near Manchester Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It {{was found that the}} transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E

5|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{organization}} were characterized by a focus on Marxist–Leninist ideology. The CPC viewed the women’s movement {{as a part of the}} larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that because most of the women continued to do domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested this assertion, stating that the economic conditions were not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> jobs could be provided to all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.|$|E
5|$|The player takes {{control of}} the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine {{vertically}} scrolling areas. The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more bosses, all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game. Players lose a life if they are hit by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed checkpoint, unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards 1-ups when the player scores a particular number of points.
