5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band generation was developed that is significantly less computationally intensive. The strategy begins {{by analyzing the}} permutations of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence class for the partial solutions <b>are</b> <b>identified,</b> the completions of the lower two bands are constructed and counted for each equivalence class.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters. Secondary craters form when large blocks ejected from the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> on lunar maps by placing a letter {{on the side of the}} crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.|$|E

5|$|Another account {{mentions}} the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), {{a group of}} the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children {{as long as they}} are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors. These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|E
50|$|Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy, {{also known}} as Berardinelli-Seip {{lipodystrophy}} was first described in 1954 by Berardinelli and later by Seip in 1959. The gene for type 1 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> as AGPAT2 at chromosome 9q34, and later the gene for type 2 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> as BSCL2 at chromosome 11q13. More recently, type 3 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> as a separate type of CGL, which <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> as a mutation in the CAV1 gene. Then, a separate type 4 CGL <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> as a mutation in the PTRF gene.|$|R

50|$|Four-hundred sixty-eight bodies <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> {{by people}} of Vinnytsia and the surroundings; the other 202 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> {{on the basis of}} {{documents}} and evidence found in the graves.

5|$|Counting {{symmetry}} partitions valid Band1 permutations into {{classes that}} place the same completion constraints on lower bands; {{all members of}} a band counting symmetry equivalence class must have {{the same number of}} grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order). Using band counting symmetry, a minimal generating set of 44 equivalence classes was established.|$|E
5|$|In 616 Æthelfrith of Bernicia, an Anglo-Saxon King, {{crossed the}} Pennines with an army and passed through Manchester {{to defeat the}} Britons in the Battle of Chester. A wave of Anglian colonists {{followed}} this military conquest and their settlements <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> by the Old English suffix ton in local place names. Royton, Middleton, Moston, Clayton, Ashton and Crompton are localities northeast of Manchester {{which may have been}} founded during that colonisation, suggesting that Crompton as a settlement could date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai police {{department}} originally identified 37 suspects—including two army officers—for their alleged {{involvement in the}} plot. All {{but two of the}} suspects, many of whom <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> only through aliases, are Pakistani. Two more suspects arrested in the United States in October 2009 for other attacks were also found to have been involved in planning the Mumbai attacks. One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{the cloud}} {{collapsed}} as the gases expanded and lost their capability {{to support their}} solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Peléan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii. Surges <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the meaning of}} the glyphs, Dietrich matched traditional Polynesian names for stars & astronomical bodies with the pictorial representations of rongorongo. This method revealed a high degree of consistency, suggesting that most if not all of the glyphs represent astronomical and navigational concepts. Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols for the stars (cf. western astronomical symbols). This fits a pattern consistent among many cultures, in which constellations <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> with people, animals, objects, and mythological beings.|$|E
