5|$|SS Empire Simba was a British steam-powered cargo ship. She was {{originally}} an American ship, launched in 1918 as SS West Cohas. During <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Navy from 1918 to 1919, {{she was called}} USS West Cohas (ID-3253).|$|E
5|$|Condor served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of her career, first in German East Africa in the 1890s, followed by <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Seas Station in the Pacific Ocean in the 1900s. She was present in East Africa amid rising tensions with Britain during the Second Boer War in 1899, and frequently suppressed uprisings in Germany's Pacific island holdings in the decade before the outbreak of World War I. Badly worn out, she returned to Germany in March 1914 and was removed from service. In 1916, she was converted into a storage hulk for mines. After the end of World War I, she was discarded and broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Coyle {{retired from}} playing duties in 1980, but {{continued}} as manager. In 1982, future manager David Jeffrey joined the club following <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Manchester United youth team and played for Coyle under {{many of his}} trophy successes, captaining the side for much of that time. One of Coyle's biggest achievements as manager was leading the club to six consecutive league titles between 1981–82 and 1986–87, equalling {{the record for the}} most consecutive titles which was set by Belfast Celtic in 1947–48. 1986 was the year that Noel Bailie began what {{would turn out to be}} a 25-year career at the club. Although a defender for most of that time, Bailie began as a left midfielder.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in India, Calthrop made {{occasional}} trips back to Britain. On one such trip he married Isabel Mary Earle, {{the daughter of the}} Reverend Walter Earle, a friend of his parents. The wedding took place on 19 November 1890 at the Bilton Parish Church, Rugby. They had four children, Everard Earle (Tev, b. 1892), Keith de Suffield (b. 1894), Isabelle Iris (b. 1895), and Betty Marion (b. 1899).

5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows {{to be a good}} child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, {{deserved}} <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E
5|$|Other major plot {{elements}} were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and {{the disappearance of}} Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peace Corps.|$|E

5|$|Adamle {{grew up in}} Cleveland, Ohio and was a star fullback on his Collinwood High School {{football}} team. He attended Ohio State University in 1942, but {{his college}} career was cut short by World War II. After <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Air Force, Adamle returned to finish his education at Ohio State in 1946. He soon dropped out of school, however, and joined the Browns. Cleveland won AAFC championships in each of Adamle's first three years, after which the league folded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland continued {{to succeed in the}} NFL, winning the 1950 championship and advancing to the 1951 championship but losing to the Los Angeles Rams. Adamle left the Browns after the 1951 season to pursue a medical degree, but he came out of retirement briefly in 1954 as the Browns won another NFL championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, she again {{visited the}} Bismarck Archipelago and the Marshall Islands. Further repairs were {{effected}} in Sydney, and the cruiser {{was back in}} Apia by 18 August. Another tour of Germany's colonies began on 23 September. She returned to Sydney for periodic maintenance in mid-March 1903, and there she received the order to return to Germany. Cormoran departed Sydney on 23 May, bound for Germany; she reached Kiel on 13 September. While in Germany, she served <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main fleet. The ship was modernized during a lengthy reconstruction that started in 1907 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig. New boilers manufactured by J W Klawitter in Danzig were installed, and her sailing rig was reduced. A new, larger conning tower was also installed. Work was completed in 1908, and on 1 May 1909, Cormoran was recommissioned for service in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, he was {{originally}} Detroit's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek {{came out of}} retirement, and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph, since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace. However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. After <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minors, {{he returned to the}} Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek decided to call it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league. After defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games, the Red Wings were defeated {{in the second round of}} the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames.|$|E

5|$|Leopard {{spent much}} of her career in the main Austro-Hungarian fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, and took part in an {{international}} naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 in an attempt to limit the Greco-Turkish War. From 1900, Leopard made two major overseas deployments, including a tour of the Pacific Ocean in 19001901, and <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East Asia squadron in 19071909. Upon returning to Austria-Hungary, the ship was modernized in 1910 and then decommissioned in May 1914, shortly before the start of World War I in July. The ship was immediately reactivated and stationed in Pola as a guard ship, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} conflict. After Austria-Hungary's defeat, Leopard was ceded to Britain as a war prize and sold to ship breakers in Italy in 1920.|$|E
