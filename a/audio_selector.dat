50|$|Some {{aircraft}} do {{not have}} jump seats in the cockpit, while others have one or two. In most airliners, the observers' seats have an <b>audio</b> <b>selector</b> panel so that the observer can monitor or participate in flight communications. An oxygen mask is provided for each station. There can be extra flight attendant jump seats in the main cabin, {{depending on how the}} airline has configured its aircraft and how many on-duty flight attendants are staffed. Both types might be stand-alone seats, or folding. Either type of jump seat may sometimes be used by off-duty staff (or an employee of another airline or other person) engaging in non-revenue travel, when no passenger seats are available in the cabin (a practice known as jumpseating). Increased security requirements for the flight deck since September 11, 2001 have meant a tightening of restrictions on who is allowed to use jump seats.|$|E
5000|$|At that point, Flight 610 was {{scheduled}} to make a right turn to intercept the 168 degree course line of the DEN low frequency range, and then to proceed to the WONT intersection, which was its next clearance limit. To intercept that course line, the plane turned to a heading of approximately 210 degrees, which was a proper intercept angle of almost 45 degrees. If the pilot had configured his <b>audio</b> <b>selector</b> switches properly, {{he would have been}} able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of [...] "A", for the north side of that low frequency range, and then as he neared the course line itself, he would begin to hear the [...] "N" [...] identifier. That would be the signal that it was time to turn left again, and track the 168 degree course line to the WONT intersection. But, the plane never turned left again. Instead, it remained on that fatal 210 degree intercept heading, until impact.|$|E
25|$|Media Library: At installation, Winamp {{scans the}} user's system for media files {{to add to}} the Media Library database. It {{supports}} full Unicode filenames and Unicode metadata for media files. In the Media Library user interface pane, under Local Media, several <b>selectors</b> (<b>Audio,</b> Video, date, and frequency) permit display of subsets of media files with greater detail.|$|R
40|$|Final project aims {{to create}} 6 <b>Audio</b> Video Input <b>Selector</b> ATmega 8 Microcontroller Based. This tool is {{expected}} to serve to help the community to facilitate the operation of <b>audio</b> video <b>selector</b> switch without using a manual system. This tool was developed in several stages, namely, (1) Identification of Needs, (2) Needs Analysis, (3) Design System, (4) Hardware Design, (5) Design Software, (6) Technical Operations, and (7) testing Tool. The device is realized by combining several sisitem the power supply circuit, rellay, push button, 16 x 2 line LCD and microcontroller ATmega 8 as a processing unit. Software design as a control program on ATmega 8 microcontroller is using the C language compiler and software as its CVAVR. Testing of this tool by selecting one of six buttons to the desired menu to the next input will {{be connected to the}} audio video output. At the time the process is rellay serves as a link, each channel consists of three relays, each of which connects the right audio / righ, audio left / Left, and Video from input to output. For audio output amplifier can be connected to the voice / video amplifier to be connected while on TV, Viewer, or other video media viewer which has RCA jack input facilities. The tool also displays the current video audio text through media LCD viewer. After testing, it can be concluded that the tool can work according to plan. This tool can load six audio video input using RCA jacks...|$|R
40|$|A {{digital signal}} {{processing}} training module (DSPTM) is constructed around a TMS 320 C 6211 starter kit. The DSP target system is enclosed in a portable case with the necessary accessories: A host port interface connector, power supply, function generator, audio amplifier, speaker, input/output <b>audio</b> sockets and <b>selector</b> switches. DSP demonstration software is bundled with custom windows 98 /XP virtual instrumentation programs that run on a host personal computer (PC). An installation and exercise manual accompanies the trainer. The developed host-target software and suggested experiments assist students in understanding data acquisition, DSP and image processing fundamentals. The open source nature of this software helps those who need {{to develop their own}} real-time algorithms. This DSPTM is an inexpensive way of reducing the gap between simulation and real-time implementation of DSP algorithms...|$|R
