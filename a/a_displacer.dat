25|$|Design of {{the flat}} {{double-acting}} Stirling engine solves the drive of <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> {{with the help of}} the fact that areas of the hot and cold pistons of the displacer are different.|$|E
25|$|The gamma {{configuration}} has two cylinders: one containing <b>a</b> <b>displacer,</b> {{with a hot}} and a cold end, and one for {{the power}} piston; they are joined to form a single space with the same pressure in both cylinders; the pistons are typically in parallel and joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have <b>a</b> <b>displacer,</b> as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] concept {{published}} in 1907 has no rotary mechanism or linkage for the displacer. This is instead {{driven by a}} small auxiliary piston, usually <b>a</b> thick <b>displacer</b> rod, with the movement limited by stops.|$|R

40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{performed}} over several years to investigate the dynamics of a free-piston Stirling engine {{for the purpose of}} computer code validation. Tests on the 1 kW (1. 33 hp) single cylinder engine have involved the determination of the sensitivity of the engine performance to variations in working space pressure, heater and cooler temperatures, regenerator porosity, power piston mass, and displacer dynamics. Maps of engine performance have been recorded with the use of an 81. 2 percent porosity regenerator. Both <b>a</b> high-efficiency <b>displacer</b> and <b>a</b> high-power <b>displacer</b> were tested; efficiencies up to 33 percent were recorded, and power output of approximately 1500 W was obtained. Preliminary results of the sensitivity tests are presented, and descriptions of future tests are given...|$|R
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low-power}} engines {{have been}} built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. <b>A</b> <b>displacer</b> type stirling engine has one piston and one displacer. A temperature difference is required between {{the top and bottom}} of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the low-temperature difference (LTD) stirling engine, the temperature difference between one's hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The power piston in the displacer type stirling engine is tightly sealed and is controlled to move up and down as the gas inside expands. The displacer, on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The displacer moves up and down to control the heating and cooling of the gas in the engine.|$|E

40|$|A 2 -watt, 4 -K helium {{refrigerator}} {{using the}} Gifford-McMahon/Joule Thomson cycle is described. The unit features <b>a</b> removable <b>displacer</b> cylinder and high-efficiency, low-pressure drop heat exchangers. These improvements {{result in a}} 100 percent increase in cooling power over the existing Deep Space Network system. The effects of the heat exchanger efficiency and Gifford-McMahon expander performance on refrigerator capacity are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{moving parts}} of the {{supercharger}} is <b>a</b> disc-shaped <b>displacer</b> with identical spirals (or scrolls) projecting from each side, and manufactured from light alloy to reduce inertia. A pair of fixed scrolls supported by the end walls of the compressor chamber are interleaved with the moving scrolls. Rather than rotating, the displacer is driven in an orbital motion to create a pumping action between the pairs of scrolls.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This is a Fluidyne variant with <b>a</b> solid <b>{{displacer}}</b> piston (3). In figure -a-, as the displacer {{moves from}} the cold compression space (2), to the hot expansion space (4) in figure -b-, {{the temperature of the}} gaseous working fluid is increased. This increases the pressure of the gaseous working fluid, and as it expands, work is done on the (red) liquid piston as it is pushed through the tube.|$|R
50|$|It {{is not so}} {{practical}} to have a cold piston, as described above, so, in many cases, <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> is used instead of the cold piston. <b>A</b> <b>displacer</b> is a solid body which moves {{back and forth in}} the cold head driving the gas back and forth between the warm and the cold end of the cold head via the regenerator. No work is required to move the displacer since, ideally there is no pressure drop over it. Typically its motion is 90 degrees out of phase with the piston. In the ideal case the COP also equals to the Carnot COP.|$|E
5000|$|In most coolers gas is {{compressed}} {{and expanded}} periodically. Well-known coolers {{such as the}} Stirling engine coolers and the popular Gifford-McMahon coolers have <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> that ensures that the cooling (due to expansion) {{takes place in a}} different region of the machine than the heating (due to compression). Due to its clever design the PTR does not have such <b>a</b> <b>displacer.</b> This means that the construction of a PTR is simpler, cheaper, and more reliable. Furthermore, there are no mechanical vibrations and no electro-magnetic interferences. The basic operation of cryocoolers and related thermal machines is described by De Waele ...|$|E
50|$|A Fluidyne {{engine is}} an alpha or gamma type Stirling engine {{with one or}} more liquid pistons. It {{contains}} a working gas (often air), and either two liquid pistons or one liquid piston and <b>a</b> <b>displacer.</b>|$|E

They can travel by bird plane or bubble or teleportation through <b>a</b> Body <b>Displacer.</b> Their children go to hypno-school to learn complex math that will never be used again, all while completely asleep. Their cities are completely climate-controlled. Outside the domes, however, lie uninhabitable desert, plagued with sandstorms, volcanic eruptions, and furry, long-eared beasts that wander the great expanses.|$|R
50|$|United States {{government}} labs {{have developed}} a modern Stirling engine design known as the Stirling Radioisotope Generator for use in space exploration. It is designed to generate electricity for deep space probes on missions lasting decades. The engine uses <b>a</b> single <b>displacer</b> to reduce moving parts and uses high energy acoustics to transfer energy. The heat source is a dry solid nuclear fuel slug, and the heat sink is radiation into free space itself.|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} removal of {{high molecular weight}} polymers from adsorbent surfaces is proved to be possible. A novel method to desorb polymers through displacement by a low molecular weight component, <b>a</b> so called <b>displacer,</b> is shown. <b>A</b> critical <b>displacer</b> concentration may be defined, above which the polymer desorption is complete. This desorption method may be important {{for a number of}} practical applications. Theoretical analysis is employed to determine which parameters govern the desorption process. A simplified model leads to an analytical expression for the critical displacer concentration. Additional information on the displacement process (i. e., effects of polymer concentration, molecular weight, and solvent quality) is obtained from more elaborate model calculations. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} determine the segmental adsorption energy if displacement data are combined with adsorption data for the corresponding displacer, provided solvency effects are properly taken into account. ...|$|R
50|$|The Atkinson {{differential}} {{engine was}} a two piston, single cylinder four-stroke engine that also used <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> piston {{to provide the}} fuel air mixture {{for use by the}} power piston. However, the power piston did the compression.|$|E
50|$|In the Dungeons & Dragons game, {{displacer}} beasts are {{fierce and}} vicious, and hate all other creatures. These sentient, magical cats often kill purely for pleasure, though they never fight among themselves. This beast uses a magical displacement ability, {{a form of}} illusion which causes it {{to appear to be}} {{a few feet away from}} where it actually is. This makes the creature hard to hit, while it attacks with its long tentacles. The displacer beast is the natural enemy of the blink dog. The hide of <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> beast has many useful magical properties, making it highly sought after by wizards and alchemists. Many thieves use the eyes of <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> beast as good luck charms, believing that they will protect the bearer from detection.|$|E

40|$|The {{position}} of the inner triplets of the LHC is monitored using Hydrostatic Levelling System (HLS) and Wire Positioning System (WPS). A regulation of these systems is needed to guarantee the sensors’ function. Such a regulation was done in-situ up to now, but the level of residual radiation {{at the level of}} the inner triplets will significantly increase with the next steps of LHC operation. Two systems have been designed to perform such a remote qualification: a filling/purging system for the HLS system and <b>a</b> wire <b>displacer</b> system for the WPS. In the paper, the requirements and the solutions proposed are described, with the emphasis on the conceptual design and the results obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{displacement}} of [(3) H]GABA binding to GABA receptors of bovine brain cortical membranes by some sulfur-containing compounds (homothiotaurine, thiotaurine and carboxymethylcysteamine) was investigated and their potency {{was compared to}} that of other known sulfur-containing analogues of GABA, such as homotaurine, homohypotaurine and taurine. Displacement studies showed homotaurine to be more effective as <b>a</b> GABA <b>displacer</b> than homohypotaurine and homothiotaurine (IC(50) : 3. 9 x 10 (? 8), 6. 7 x 10 (? 7) and 6. 8 x 10 (? 7) M, respectively). Saturation experiments showed that the effect of taurine, homothiotaurine, homotaurine and homohypotaurine was due to a loss of high-affinity GABA sites (K(d) = 10. 7 nM). Homotaurine seems also to interact with low-affinity sites, decreasing the affinity constant, whereas the number of binding sites remains unchanged...|$|R
40|$|A very low-power, low-interference Stirling {{cryocooler}} {{is being}} developed based on principles and techniques described in several previous publications {{over the last four}} years. It differs in several important details from those built previously. It uses <b>a</b> tapered <b>displacer</b> based upon <b>an</b> analytical optimization procedure. The displacer is driven by an auxiliary piston and cylinder (rather than by mechanical linkage) using some of the working fluid itself to provide the driving force. This provides smooth, vibration-free motion, and, more importantly, allows complete mechanical and spatial separation of the cryostat from the pressure-wave generator. Either of two different pressure-wave generators can be used. One is a non-contaminating, unlubricated ceramic piston and cylinder. The other is a compressed-air-operated rubber diaphragm with motor-driven valves to cycle the pressure between appropriate limits...|$|R
40|$|Development of a {{model for}} a {{multiple}} stage Stirling cycle cryocooler has been a topic of research for the last four to five years. The model can help to optimize the design parameters of the machine and to predict the performance of the machine under different operating conditions.

The model so developed has been validated by experimental results...|$|R
50|$|The Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC) is a {{completely}} sealed heat transfer system that has only two moving parts (a piston and <b>a</b> <b>displacer),</b> and which can use helium as the working fluid. The piston is typically driven by an oscillating magnetic field that {{is the source of}} the power needed to drive the refrigeration cycle. The magnetic drive allows the piston to be driven without requiring any seals, gaskets, O-rings, or other compromises to the hermetically sealed system. Claimed advantages for the system include improved efficiency and cooling capacity, lighter weight, smaller size and better controllability.|$|E
50|$|In {{the classic}} configuration, the work {{produced}} via the water pistons is integrated with a water pump. The simple pump is {{external to the}} engine, and consists of two check valves, one on the intake {{and one on the}} outlet. In the engine, the loop of oscillating liquid {{can be thought of as}} acting as <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> piston. The liquid in the single tube extending to the pump acts as the power piston. Traditionally the pump is open to the atmosphere, and the hydraulic head is small, so that the absolute engine pressure is close to atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|A Manson-Guise {{engine is}} an {{improved}} {{version of a}} Manson engine. It {{is a type of}} hot air engine, converting a temperature difference into motion. There is a hot side and a cold side to the engine. Providing there is a large enough temperature difference between the two sides the engine will run. The Manson-Guise engine is probably the simplest type of hot air engines having only a single con-rod, with <b>a</b> <b>displacer</b> piston and power piston that move at the same time. Manson-Guise engines seem to be fairly unique in the fact that they can run in either direction (flywheel can run clockwise or anti-clockwise).|$|E

Later, the Loremaster informs Jason that the second story of the building is strictly prohibited. Finding the books on the first floor to be of little use, he lets curiosity overwhelm him. After discovering the method by which to open the extremely complex lock guarding the second floor, Jason ventures inside at night. He finds the place (as well as the books inside) to be eerie and sinister. After wandering about for a bit, he stumbles across a large text entitled, The Book of Salzared. The book is bound in human skin and has tiny pores, fine hairs and light blue veins. It is also warm to the touch because it was made with <b>a</b> <b>displacer's</b> skin. Upon opening it, Jason discovers a strong warning stating that anyone who reads further will place themselves in peril. He reads on, valuing the potential to discover a way home over the risk involved.

The engine operation for boosted conditions was very smooth, there being no combustion shock even at the highest maximum cylinder pressures.
