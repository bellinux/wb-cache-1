5|$|After Karthi had {{completed}} his film Aayirathil Oruvan, the principal photography for Paiyaa began on 24 December 2008 at a highway near Bangalore. Shooting carried on {{in and around}} Bangalore in the following weeks. The film's main portions were extensively shot <b>across</b> <b>some</b> major highways, where the story plays, whilst the climax was filmed in Mumbai, where the journey would also end. The filming also took place in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came <b>across</b> <b>some</b> raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E
5|$|Rouget's {{division}} and Paris' brigade apparently {{began to pull}} back after Darmagnac's retreat. Seeing a gap open between Rouget and Taupin, Wellington ordered the 52nd Foot to advance from the Roman Camp and drive a wedge into the French defensive line. The unit's commander John Colborne led his men <b>across</b> <b>some</b> marshy ground and then up the slope toward the Luc knoll, followed by Wellington and his staff. They won a foothold {{at the top of}} the ridge on Taupin's left flank. With both its flanks turned, Taupin's division hurriedly retreated to the northeast, the last French unit to be dislodged. The mauled division never rallied, though it managed to save all but two of its cannons. At some position to the rear, Rouget's {{division and}} Paris' brigade joined together and fought a hard battle against the pursuing Allies.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} shield volcanoes {{can be found}} in {{selected}} locations on the lunar surface, such as on Mons Rümker. These are believed to be formed by relatively viscous, possibly silica-rich lava, erupting from localized vents. The resulting lunar domes are wide, rounded, circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint. They are typically 8–12km in diameter, but can be up to 20km <b>across.</b> <b>Some</b> of the domes contain a small pit at their peak.|$|E
25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting <b>across,</b> <b>some</b> of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had {{made a career out}} of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott said PETA should apologize to Irwin's family and the rest of Australia.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{friction}} between the Western Allies and Soviets was steadily rising. The Soviets even took to marking out their border by stationing armed soldiers along it at intervals of a few metres, day and night, in all weathers. Since there was not, as yet, a fixed marker, the borders were prone to abuse, which eventually resulted (in August 1948), in white lines in luminous paint appearing across roads and even through ruined buildings to try to deter the Soviets from making unauthorised incursions into the American and British zones. These measures were only partially successful: after further skirmishes in which shots were fired, barbed wire entanglements were stretched <b>across</b> <b>some</b> roads, a foretaste of things to come.|$|E

25|$|The crew {{launched}} straight away. After their 11-hour journey across Exmoor, {{they now}} had to row for an hour into the storm to reach the Forrest Hall which was anchored close to Hurlstone Point. The lifeboat stood by – the crew rowing continuously to hold a safe position – until daylight when two tugs arrived and {{managed to get a}} new rope <b>across.</b> <b>Some</b> of the lifeboatmen went on board to help raise the anchors as the crew were too tired to do it themselves. The tugs took it across the channel to Barry, accompanied by the Louisa and the Lynmouth lifeboat volunteers in case there were further problems. They finally arrived in port at about 05:00 on 14 January. The lifeboat crew were towed back to Lynmouth by a steam ship.|$|E

During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and jetski, part powered by bioethanol, and then to travel <b>across</b> <b>some</b> of the vast ice desert by wind-powered kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50km/h (30mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.|$|E

25|$|As the {{dry season}} takes effect, the islets on the crest become wider and more numerous, and in September to January {{up to half of}} the rocky face of the falls may become dry and the bottom of the First Gorge can be seen along most of its length. At this time it becomes {{possible}} (though not necessarily safe) to walk <b>across</b> <b>some</b> stretches of the river at the crest. It is also possible to walk {{to the bottom of the}} First Gorge at the Zimbabwean side. The minimum flow, which occurs in November, is around a tenth of the April figure; this variation in flow is greater than that of other major falls, and causes Victoria Falls' annual average flow rate to be lower than might be expected based on the maximum flow.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Santa Fe in October, General Kearny had {{dispatched}} Captain (now Lieutenant Colonel) Philip St. George Cooke, West Point {{class of}} 1827, to assume {{command of the}} battalion. His assignment was to march them to California and to build a wagon road along the way. In Santa Fe several sick men and {{all but a few}} of the women and children were sent to Pueblo, in present-day Colorado. Three separate detachments left the battalion and went to Pueblo to winter. For the next four months and 1,100 miles, Cooke led the battalion <b>across</b> <b>some</b> of the most arduous terrain in North America. Most of the Mormon soldiers soon learned to respect and follow him. The group acquired another guide in New Mexico – adventurer and mountain man Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who as an infant had traveled with his mother Sacagawea across the continent with the Lewis and Clark Expedition.|$|E
