500|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} Timberlake's {{tunnel vision}} {{of his love}} interest, with several voyeuristic references. The singer professes his love: [...] "I look around and everything I see is beautiful, because <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> is you." [...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a crowded room, but my camera lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as we ride off into the sun." [...] According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake uses references to [...] "cameras and reflective surfaces" [...] {{to reflect on the}} [...] "changing nature of celebrity".|$|E

After 1971 {{he also took}} amphetamines, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 {{that he could not}} stop taking the drug for a month. Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: [...] "Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> is a blank piece of paper." [...] After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his amphetamine use.|$|E

2500|$|Rygg {{described}} Shadows of the Sun as [...] "our {{most personal}} record to date." [...] Commenting in Unrestrained magazine in 2007, Rygg said, [...] "I'm a diagnosed depressive, {{and should have}} been trying to focus on living, but instead I've immersed myself in some isolated, dark and paranoid place. It has no doubt helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind." [...] Adding, “Sometimes <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> is darkness; it's overpowering. So this record is about venting out a lot of that stuff, the gloom, but it also represents some kind of quiet acceptance. Like this is how the situation is, and you're just gonna have to live with it. Use it for what it's worth." ...|$|E

[...] Starting in the 2008 season, Hendrick Motorsports merged its Nationwide Series team to Earnhardt's JR Motorsports, with the cars coming from Earnhardt's shop, which employs his mother and uncles.|$|E
