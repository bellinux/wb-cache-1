40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{and nuclear}} magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to study the metabolism of deuterated n-alkanes (C 6 to C 12) and 1 - 13 C-labeled n-hexane by a highly enriched sulfate-reducing bacterial culture. All substrates were activated via fumarate addition to form the corresponding <b>alkylsuccinic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives as transient metabolites. Formation of d 14 -hexylsuccinic acid in cell extracts from exogenously added, fully deuterated n-hexane confirmed that this reaction was the initial step in anaerobic alkane metabolism. Analysis of resting cell suspensions amended with 1 - 13 C-labeled n-hexane confirmed that addition of the fumarate occurred at the C- 2 carbon of the parent substrate. Subsequent metabolism of hexylsuccinic acid resulted {{in the formation of}} 4 -methyloctanoic acid, and 3 -hydroxy- 4 -methyloctanoic acid was tentatively identified. We also found that 13 C nuclei from 1 - 13 C-labeled n-hexane became incorporated into the succinyl portion of the initial metabolite in a manner that indicated that 13 C-labeled fumarate was formed and recycled during alkane metabolism. Collectively, the findings obtained with a sulfate-reducing culture using isotopically labeled alkanes augment and support the previously proposed pathway (H. Wilkes, R. Rabus, T. Fischer, A. Armstroff, A. Behrends, and F. Widdel, Arch. Microbiol. 177 : 235 - 243, 2002) for metabolism of deuterated n-hexane by a denitrifying bacterium...|$|E
