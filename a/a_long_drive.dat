5|$|Maryland next {{traveled}} to South Carolina {{to face a}} team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted it away and the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered a Maryland fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed {{them back to the}} 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards the final result was 24–6.|$|E
5|$|After {{the teams}} traded punts {{to open the}} second half, Derrick Henry made the score 31–24 with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} run for the only points scored in the third quarter. Oklahoma next scored on their opening possession of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard Knight touchdown pass to Shepard that capped an eight-play drive. Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron that cut the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, the Sooners closed the game with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that ran down the clock and in the final minute, an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Sooners 1–3–1.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{continued}} their scoring {{into the third}} quarter with touchdowns on their first two possessions of the half. The first came on a 38-yard McCarron pass to Amari Cooper on a drive that also saw McCarron complete a pass to his brother Corey McCarron. The second came on a 31-yard Chris Black run that made the score 42–0. With the Crimson Tide significantly up, mostly back-up players completed the fourth quarter. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> stalled at the Mocs' 23-yard line, Eddie Jackson returned a C. J. Board fumble caused by Jonathan Allen to the Chattanooga six-yard line. On the next play, Dee Hart made the final score 49–0 with his six-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 12–0.|$|E

As the film starts, Homer acts loud and obnoxious, {{embarrassing}} Marge. When he gives away the film's ending, Marge berates him and the audience heckles Homer, embarrassing them both. During the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer will not accept it, by dropping Marge and the children off at home and goes off on <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> into the night, finally stopping at a redneck bar called Beer 'N' Brawl, where he grabs a beer while listening to an attractive waitress named Lurleen Lumpkin performing on stage.

5|$|The game {{began at}} 1:35p.m. PST in rainy {{conditions}} that had affected the San Francisco Bay Area for {{days before the}} contest. The Lobos scored a touchdown on the game's first drive to take an early lead, but the Midshipmen scored three touchdowns to bring the score to 21–7 {{early in the second}} quarter. After the Lobos narrowed that lead to 12 points {{by the end of the}} third quarter, the Midshipmen began <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> which took up much of the fourth quarter. The drive ended with a field goal, which gave Navy a 15-point lead with a little over two minutes remaining in the game. On the next drive from the Lobos, the Midshipmen forced a turnover on downs and ran out the clock with their last possession to win the game.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, however, Cincinnati's offense managed to begin moving the ball effectively. On Cincinnati’s first {{play of the}} second half, halfback Roger Stephens broke through the Virginia Tech {{defensive}} line for 26 yards, taking the ball inside Virginia Tech territory. Cincinnati's drive would overcome two 15-yard penalties and one five-yard penalty {{en route to a}} touchdown just a few plays later. On its next possession, Cincinnati's All-American Roger Stephens again broke off another long run, this time for 19 yards, setting up another Bearcats' touchdown. Virginia Tech countered with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that reached the Cincinnati 23-yard line before an errant pass was intercepted by the Bearcats in the end zone. Virginia Tech managed a defensive stop, however, and marched down the field for a touchdown to climb within six points. Cincinnati sealed its victory, however, when Bearcats' halfback Harold Johnson intercepted a Virginia Tech pass late in the fourth quarter, returning {{it all the way to}} the Virginia Tech 25-yard line. That return set up a Cincinnati touchdown and put the Bearcats up by the game's final score, 18–6.|$|E
5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old Collier {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 74–33–2 record. Nick Skorich was named as his replacement the following year. Skorich came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, when the team won the championship. In Cleveland's first year under Skorich, the team improved to 9–5 but lost to the Colts in a divisional playoff. Mike Phipps was promoted to starting quarterback over Nelsen before the 1972 season. After a sluggish start, the Browns went on tear and finished with a 10–4 record. That put Cleveland in a playoff against the undefeated Miami Dolphins. The Browns took a lead in the fourth quarter on a touchdown catch by wide receiver Fair Hooker, but the Dolphins responded with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> of their own, aided by a pair of Paul Warfield receptions. Running back Jim Kiick ran for a touchdown, sealing a 20–14 win and preserving the Dolphins' perfect season. The following year, Phipps threw 20 interceptions and completed less than half of his passes. After winning four of the first six games, the Browns slumped and placed third in the division with a 7–5–2 record.|$|E
5|$|A {{victory against}} Los Angeles in the twelfth {{week of the}} season {{preserved}} Cleveland's undefeated record. The Dons began the scoring in the first quarter with a 75-yard drive engineered by quarterback Glenn Dobbs. The series ended with a short touchdown run by halfback Walt Clay. The Browns came back to tie the game in the second quarter after a 71-yard drive that features several completions from Graham to Lavelli. Lavelli caught a 49-yard pass from Graham for the score. On the next possession, Los Angeles converted a fourth down deep in their own territory, extending <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that ended with another touchdown by Clay. Cleveland again evened the score with under two minutes left in the first half on a touchdown pass to Edgar Jones. The Browns pulled away in the third quarter, when Graham ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. Groza later kicked a 36-yard field goal, and an interception by Cliff Lewis set up a run by Tony Adamle for a final touchdown. The final score was 31–14. Graham twisted his knee in the fourth quarter, and Edgar Jones, Parseghian and Bob Gaudio also had injuries. The Browns planned to stay at the hot springs in Boyes, California to recover as they prepared to face the 49ers for a second time in San Francisco three days later.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers {{won their}} first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back Ricky Bell {{recorded}} 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Bell's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record, tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII, while the Eagles' Wilbert Montgomery {{was held to}} 35 yards on 12 attempts. The Buccaneers' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown, and a Neil O'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10–0 lead. Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4-yard line and led to Bell's second touchdown run, giving the Buccaneers a 17–0 second-quarter lead. Trying to extend that lead before halftime, Doug Williams hurried a pass that {{wound up in the}} hands of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11-yard line. This set up Ron Jaworski's touchdown pass to Charles Smith. After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17–10 on a Tony Franklin field goal, a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles' rally. A 9-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers' scoring. It was only in the final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive,</b> ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael. The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game. The Buccaneers' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery. At one point, when Leroy Harris was gang-tackled following a short reception, the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing. The Buccaneers' hard-hitting play intimidated the Eagles' receivers into dropping 10 passes. Going into the matchup, the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience. Jaworski was the third-rated quarterback in the NFC, while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks. The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals, McKay of USC and Dick Vermeil of UCLA. The game was the Buccaneers' first on national television. Word of the upset spread as far as Iran, where the hostages were surprised to learn of the Buccaneers' contention for the Super Bowl.|$|E

25|$|The tie {{forced a}} playoff to {{determine}} whether the Browns or Giants would win the American Conference and play in the championship game. Cleveland won the playoff 8–3 in freezing weather at Cleveland Stadium. A week later, on Christmas Eve, the Browns faced the Rams at home in the championship. Cleveland fell behind 28–20 in the fourth quarter against the Rams' potent offense, but quarterback Otto Graham engineered a comeback with a touchdown pass to Rex Bumgardner and <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that set up a winning field goal by Lou Groza with 28 seconds left to play. It was the first of six straight NFL championship appearances for the Browns. Cleveland fullback Marion Motley led the NFL in rushing, and seven Browns were selected to play in the first-ever Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Airlines {{was founded}} after the {{agreement}} between the airlines and cities to relocate to DFW and was not {{a party to the}} agreement, and felt that their business model would be affected by <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> to the new airport. Before DFW's opening, Southwest filed suit to remain at Love Field, claiming that no legal basis existed to close the airport to commercial service and that they were not bound by an agreement they did not sign. In 1973, a Federal District Court ruled that, so long as Love Field remained open, the City of Dallas could not preclude Southwest from operating there. The ruling was in the regulated environment where the CAB did not have control of travel within a state, the only service Southwest then offered.|$|E

25|$|CINCY kicker Tony Miliano, {{who entered}} the attempt having made just 6 of 15 {{attempts}} on the season, made a 34-yard field goal attempt within the first minute of the quarter to make the score 16–3. After that, UNC once again embarked on <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> that lasted 12 plays for 76 yards and 4:01 and culminated with a Jack Tabb 3-yard touchdown reception from Marquise Williams, making the score 23–3. Later in the quarter, Miliano missed a 46-yard field goal attempt, and subsequently the teams exchanged punts. UNC punted on their next drive after failing to convert a third and ten, instead losing five yards to knock them out of field goal range; the punt was downed at the CINCY 6-yard line. CINCY {{did not attempt to}} score particularly vigorously, not running any pass plays, and ultimately heading into the half trailing by 20.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1954 Conacher was in Ottawa {{attending}} to his parliamentary duties {{when he was asked}} to play in the annual softball game between MPs and members of the parliamentary press gallery. On May 26, in the sixth inning, in his last at-bat-ever, he hit <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> into left field, stretching a single into a triple, when he sprinted to third base. He stood, breathing heavily and then collapsed face-first from having been hit {{in the head with a}} pitch in an earlier inning. One of the other MPs was a doctor who tried to assist him, but there was little that could be done for Conacher and within twenty minutes he was pronounced dead. The next day Conacher was supposed to attend his daughter's graduation from the University of Toronto. A big funeral was held, and his brother Charlie flew in from England to be there. He was buried at St. Johns York Mills Anglican Church Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The company {{felt that the}} notion of a quick trip would be destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>drive</b> to the new airport. Prior to the opening of DFW, Southwest Airlines sued for the right to remain at Love Field. In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E
