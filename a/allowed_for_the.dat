5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography.

The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{severely}} curtailed {{tobacco production}} {{in favor of}} more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, and barley.

In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee.|$|E
5|$|SAS version 4 {{had limited}} features, but made SAS more accessible.

This <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> SAS' Multivendor Architecture {{that allows the}} software to run on UNIX, MS-DOS, and Windows. It was previously written in PL/I, Fortran, and assembly language.|$|E

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. This was the case as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. This expansion <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> airport to add customs officials to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the economic downturn in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E

5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.
