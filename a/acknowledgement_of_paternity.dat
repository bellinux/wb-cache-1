Later in the 60s, Tadé expanded his work by wooden sculptures looking like insects or Mars people. In addition, he started his typical design of Mediterranean houses.|$|E
50|$|The Domestic Purposes Benefit, or DPB, {{was first}} {{introduced}} in New Zealand in 1973 by the country's 3rd Labour government led by Prime Minister Norman Kirk. The Destitute Persons Act 1910 and the Domestic Proceedings Act 1968 had previously created a statutory means by which a woman could seek a maintenance order against {{the father of her}} children. The court could, at its discretion, set the rate that it thought appropriate for the father to pay the mother in respect of the child. This maintenance continued until the child reached the age of sixteen; maintenance would continue to be payable in respect of a child over the age of sixteen if the child was engaged in full-time education. These statutes provided a means by which women could seek maintenance from the putative father, but in the event of any difficulties, women had to resort to the court in order to enforce the maintenance agreement or order. There were also further difficulties; an unmarried mother had to obtain an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> from the father or a declaration of paternity from the court in order to be entitled to seek maintenance. The DPB, introduced in statutory form in 1973, mitigated these difficulties. The Act provided State financial support for single mothers, irrespective of whether the father was contributing to maintenance payments.|$|E

40|$|Voluntary <b>acknowledgements</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> (VAPs) {{significantly}} determine male legal parentage {{at birth}} for many children born of sex to unwed {{mothers in the}} United States. VAP processes are chiefly dictated by the federal Social Security Act, which places certain mandates on states participating in federally-subsidized welfare programs. These processes include norms on effective VAP establishments and on VAP disestablishments, either via early rescissions (within 60 days) by signatories or via later contests (after 60 days) by challengers, including signatories. The norms are driven by the Act’s desire to increase reimbursements of state child welfare payments from unwed fathers {{regardless of whether the}} fathers are childrearing. These VAP processes are significantly employed by states for all children of unwed parents, regardless of any welfare assistance, and for childcare as well as child support purposes. Such uses create tensions since legal parentage often {{has nothing to do with}} welfare. Further, as to VAP contests, notwithstanding the Act’s promotion of uniform norms, there are significant variations in American state laws. Differences on VAP contests arise regarding who may challenge; what proof is required for an effective challenge; and what time limits exist for any challenge. These variations can prompt troubling results that should be mitigated through reforms of VAP challenge processes undertaken at the federal level. Because parentage establishments and contests are usually undertaken with no focus on welfare reimbursement and much focus on the childcare interests of parents and the wellbeing of children, American states should create separate parental acknowledgment processes operating outside of the Social Security Act. Such processes, at a minimum, should allow acknowledgments by alleged parents who claim to have met state de facto (and comparable) parent standards, including both men and women. De-emphasizing welfare reimbursements, and emphasizing child wellbeing, will better ensure that beneficial (if not constitutionally protected) parent-child relations continue...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the tale}} in first person of how I {{discovered}} the “Tensive target organ damage/Monitoring prehypertension syndrome”, which received an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> with the nosographic eponym of “Cugini’s syndrome”. The presentation {{is made with}} the intention of showing how the research methodology and clinical reasoning can act as an epistemological guide, primarily in detecting and, secondarily in defining such a syndromic picture. I will narrate, in an anecdotal way, the history of this syndrome that has origin in 1980 when I received the invitation to approach, as Visiting Professor, the Chronobiology Laboratories of Minnesota University, directly from their legendary Chief, Prof. Franz Halberg, the Founder of the discipline “Chronobiology”. As an invited participant to an international project of research named: “International Womb-to-Tomb Chronome Initiative”, devoted to standardize the time-qualified reference limits of blood pressure from neonatal to old age, I could use the first available equipments (Pressurometers) for executing the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. Accordingly, I started to collect the ABPM of a large sample size of clinically healthy subjects. Collection continued going back and forth between Italy and USA. In this activity of recruitment for creating a database of true normotensives and true hypertensives, I had the chance to meet some office normotensives who inexplicably showed initial signs of hypertensive retinopathy, a sign of “Target Organ Damage” (TOD), while, unexpectedly, were showing no supranormal BP values at the ABPM. In order to explain the retinal TOD, I suspected that they were true non-hypertensives but not true normotensives (presumably normotensives alias putative normotensives). Therefore, I compared the Daily Mean Level of their 24 -h systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values [DML(SBP/DBP) ] with the analogous estimate of the true normotensives. With surprise I could see that the retinopathic putative normotensives, despite the lack of surpranormal at the ABPM, had their DML(SBP/DBP) significantly increased, just in between true normotension and true hypertension. It was the year 1997, when I called this intermediate BP regimen: “ABPM-diagnosable prehypertension”, alias “monitoring prehypertension”, alias “pressurometric prehypertension”, alias “masked prehypertension”, and described the “Minimal-change hypertensive retinopathy/monitoring prehypertension syn- drome”. The association of a minimal tensive TOD with a monitoring prehypertension in office normotensives received a confirmatory certainty in other consecutive investigations, performed by me from 1997 to 2002, dealing with minimal signs respectively of: 1. interventricular septum hypertrophy in native hearts, 2. interventricular septum hypertrophy in novel transplanted hearts, 3. gestational impaired blood flow uterine arteries, 4. intrauterine growth retardation, 5. endothelial dysfunction. In all these clinical pictures, I could demonstrate that the initial tensive TOD was associated to a significant elevation of DML(SBP/DBP) just in between normotension and hypertension as per a monitoring prehypertension. Accordingly, I enlarged the appellative of the syndromic picture in “Minimal signs of TOD/monitoring prehypertension”, alias “Tensive target organ damage/Monitoring prehypertension”. Importantly, in 2007 and 2009 this clinical association has been eponimically called: “Cugini’s syndrome” in an international context...|$|E

40|$|False {{paternity}} {{occurs when}} a man is incorrectly presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated {{to be the father}} of a child even though, contrary to his own belief, he has no biological relationship to the child.

40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) protects {{parents with}} primary custody rights from parental {{abduction}} or retention {{of their children}} in another country. However, as more couples in the United States forgo marriage but continue having children, these couples-who often prefer informal parenting arrangements-do not often obtain court orders that identify their custody or visitation rights. Yet if an unmarried parent relocated to another country without the other parent 2 ̆ 7 s consent, the parties would {{have to rely on}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s default custody rules to determine where the custody battle should ensue. For example, Mexican jurisdictions follow a Roman civil law tradition, patria potestas (parental authority). From birth or voluntary <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> parental authority gives both parents the right to care and control their children and their children 2 ̆ 7 s property. However, in most United States jurisdictions, custody rights do not arise automatically simply because a child was born to unmarried parents. Instead, voluntary acknowledgment of paternity serves as a basis from which a parent can seek the court 2 ̆ 7 s determination of custody in the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interests. These differences in approaches to child custody appeared in two recent Convention cases in the Seventh Circuit. In both Garcia v. Pinelo and Martinez v. Cahue, the unmarried fathers voluntarily acknowledged paternity of their children. In Garcia, the Seventh Circuit found that the unmarried father, who resided in Mexico, had a right of custody under the Convention pursuant to the Mexican laws of parental authority. In contrast, in Martinez, the Seventh Circuit found that Illinois law presumes, {{in the absence of a}} court order, an unmarried mother has sole custody of her child. Therefore, the unmarried father in Martinez, who did not obtain a custody order before the mother moved to Mexico, did not have any rights of custody under the Convention, despite having acknowledged paternity. In light of demographic trends towards fewer marriages and more informal parenting arrangements, should jurisdictions like Illinois adopt child custody rules that endow rights of custody to both parents at birth or upon acknowledgement of the child? In order to protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests and to preserve the status quo before an alleged wrongful retention or abduction, Illinois should not adopt a rule like parental authority laws. While as a society we may want parents to share significant decision-making and to cooperate regarding their children 2 ̆ 7 s upbringing, default rules regarding children should protect children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests rather than parental rights. Illinois 2 ̆ 7 s presumption requires a court to consider the children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests before awarding custody and visitation rights while parental authority laws automatically confer decision-making authority to parents. Children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests are better served when a court protects stability and the status quo in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives rather than enabling a parent to assert parental rights for the first time under a Hague Convention petition...|$|E

40|$|Models of optimal parental {{investment}} {{predict that}} variation in certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> {{can affect the}} optimal level of paternal investment when a male's expected paternity in different nesting attempts is not fixed throughout his lifetime. Several attempts to test this prediction experimentally in monogamous birds have failed to induce a reduction in care by males. This may be because the method used, detaining males, is a poor model for {{what happens when a}} male's certainly <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> is naturally reduced. We caught and detained female collared flycatchers Flctdula piNtvttit for 1 h immediately after laying on one or two occasions in an attempt to induce variation in certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> for the males they were mated to. By capturing females immediately after laying we hoped to exploit the existence of an &quot;insemination window &quot; since males should be very sensitive to female absence during this period. The general effect of the experimental manipulation was consistent with reduced certainty of paternity: males responded by reducing their level of paternal care to nettling*, and males mated to females that had been caught on one morning fed nestlings significantly less often and made a smaller share of feeding visits than males mated to control females. The effects of the experiment were generally weak, however, and we argue that certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> may be fixed well before egg laying, in which case experimental manipulations are unlikely to have large effects. It is difficult to predict the effects of natural variation in certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> on levels <b>of</b> male paternal care because differential allocation by females mated to attractive males may act in the opposite direction.

40|$|The {{way that}} {{variation}} in paternity affects the optimal level of paternal {{effort has been}} a contentious issue, {{both in terms of}} theory and the empirical data needed to test competing theories. Clarification of the theoretical issues has led to the prediction that a reduction in paternal effort should only be expected when (i) there are substantial costs of paternal care and (ii) males have available some cue to their share <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> in the current brood. Previous work on the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, has shown that the first condition is supported because of trade-offs between paternal effort and secondary sexual character size. We carried out experimental manipulations of pairs of collared flycatchers (temporary male removal), which were effective in causing variation in paternity in the current brood. Male responses to these manipulations were studied by quantifying levels of paternal care. All males reared nestlings cross-fostered from non-experimental nests at the egg stage, thus ruling out the possibility that they responded to direct cues about <b>paternity.</b> The timing <b>of</b> male removal predicted the male's share <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> suggesting that males had a clear cue to their share <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> thereby fulfilling the second condition. As expected, the male's share of care, and rate of provisioning, were positively related to his share <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> The suggestion that the timing of removal was the cue used by males to predict their share <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> was supported, since after the influence of this variable was controlled, there was no longer any relationship between paternity and paternal care. These data provide qualitative support for optimality models of paternal care in relation to certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> and suggest that quantitative tests of the models are possible in well-characterized systems...|$|R
