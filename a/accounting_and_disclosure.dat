5000|$|If {{the broker}} is helping both the buyer and the seller, this is {{referred}} to as a [...] "dual agency". Traditionally, the broker represents the seller, and his fiduciary duty is to the seller.

Under a dual agency transaction, it is vital that the broker disclose to both parties whom he represents as a client and whom he represents as a customer. A real estate broker owes his client fiduciary duties, which include care, confidentiality, loyalty, obedience, <b>accounting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure.</b> To protect his license to practice, a real estate broker owes his customer fair and honest dealing and must request that both parties (seller and buyer) sign a dual agency agreement.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the causes of {{variations}} in financial <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices in a municipal setting highly influenced by governance reforms - the Swedish municipal waste management sector. This focus is motivated by the claim that recent governance reforms have made the organization of public services delivery more diversified and fragmented, which may have had a negative effect on transparency and accountability. Design/methodology/approach: To document the <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices of the Swedish solid waste management organizations, a questionnaire approach was selected. The study uses a conceptual theoretical framework that complements the basic variables considered to influence public sector financial <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices with factors such as competition and municipal governance forms. Findings: The results show that compliance <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> transparency to some extent have different antecedents and that the external environment, including market competition, size and economic input, influences both. The governance forms, on the other hand, only influenced compliance accounting (negatively and positively) and not the willingness to disclose information in general. The overall conclusion is that changes to the economic and institutional context mixed with different municipal governance forms introduces a multiplicity of forces that makes the accounting practices themselves diversified and fragmented and not necessarily only in a "negative" direction. Practical implications: From a policy perspective the results indicate that the changing institutional and organizational environment has not been matched by attention to, and regulation of, reporting structures that secure external vertical accountability processes. The general implication for future regulations should therefore be to recognize the influence of different economic and institutional forces and develop accountability models that enable and preserve the benefits of governance reform initiatives without losing accountability and transparency. Originality/value: Few prior quantitative studies have theoretically related municipal <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices to factors such as market competition and popular municipal governance forms (municipal corporation, regional cooperation, outsourcing, etc.). Knowledge of how reforms might influence municipal accounting practices might benefit future policy decisions on accountability models with aim of enable and preserve the benefits of governance reform initiatives without losing accountability and transparency...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> accountability practices of Fairtrade International (FLO), {{one of the}} largest Fair Trade umbrella organizations. Our aim is to explore whether new forms of <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> related <b>disclosures</b> emerge in the reporting practices of FLO and how these reflect their self-declared social mission towards the emancipation and sustainability of producers. Using thematic analysis and reflecting on Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic power, we analyse FLO’s reporting practices from 2006 to 2013. Our findings reveal that FLO mobilises the taken-for-granted images and symbols of ’fairness’ in the Fair Trade system by using descriptive statistics of Fair Trade premium distributions and pictures of producers but keeps silent to current concerns surrounding the limitations of Fair Trade. Such findings extend important insights into how new forms of <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> related <b>disclosure</b> are used to legitimise the practice of Fair Trade...|$|R

The Psychological Attraction Approach to <b>Accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Disclosure</b> Policy We offer here the psychological attraction approach to <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> rules, regulation, and policy {{as a program}} for positive accounting research. We suggest that psychological forces have shaped and continue to shape rules and policies in two different ways. (1) Good Rules for Bad Users: rules and policies that provide information {{in a form that}} is useful for users who are subject to bias and cognitive processing constraints. (2) Bad Rules: superfluous or even pernicious rules and policies that result from psychological bias {{on the part of the}} ‘designers ’ (managers, users, auditors, regulators, politicians, or voters). We offer some initial ideas about psychological sources of the use of historical costs, conservatism, aggregation, and a focus on downside outcomes in risk disclosures. We also suggest that psychological forces cause informal shifts in reporting and disclosure regulation and policy, which can exacerbate boom/bust patterns in financial markets. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{a normative}} assumption about accountability in organizations: that more accountability is necessarily better. More specifically, it examines {{two forms of}} “myopia ” that characterize conceptions of accountability among service-oriented nonprofit organizations: (a) accountability {{as a set of}} unconnected binary relationships rather than as a system of relations and (b) accountability as short-term and rule-following behavior rather than as a means to longer-term social change. The article explores the effects of these myopias on a central mechanism of accountability in organizations—evaluation—and proposes a broader view of accountability that includes organizational learning. Future directions for research and practice are elaborated. Keywords: accountability; organizational learning; evaluation; reporting; outcome measurement The notion of accountability has attracted much attention over the past decade.

40|$|As {{there is}} a strong {{relationship}} of disclosure regimes and corporate governance the internationally varying distribution of information rights can be interpreted as a function of different systems of corporate governance. A disclosure system comprises all legally recognized information claims that a system of corporate governance or a financial system furnishes financial contracting parties with: Both public disclosure and disclosure via private information channels may serve value-relevant information for suppliers of finance. An analysis {{within the framework of the}} New Institutional Economics brings about two findings: First, looking at the distribution of informational rights from a contractual perspective shows that the nexus of information rights formed by <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> regulation and the distribution of power in the firm are mutually determining. For example, the main financing parties in Germany, banks and blockholders, have fairly good access to information via institutionalized internal information channels. Secondly, internationally accepted sets of accounting standards may improve the monitoring by markets. Nevertheless, <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> regulation sometimes resemble a cookbook and should be transformed in a more principle-based and deductive system. Furthermore the whole institutional design of corporate governance should be based on realistic assumptions about human decision making to serve the intended purposes. ...|$|E
