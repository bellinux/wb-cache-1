5|$|The first {{scenario}} was {{a hostage}} rescue mission where a submarine 3 kilometers {{off the coast}} of a third world nation must send in an aerial robot to find a coastal city, identify the embassy where the hostages are being held, locate valid openings in the embassy building, enter (or send in <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the hostages back 3km to the submarine prior to mounting an amphibious assault on the embassy to free the hostages.|$|E

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of <b>a</b> <b>sensor,</b> they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, {{only as good as}} the human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{develops}} {{gas detection}} modules for the intelligent building. The modules use many gas sensors to detect {{environment of the}} home and building. The gas sensors of the detection modules are classified two types. One is competitiveness gas detection module, and uses the same sensors to detect gas leakage. The other is complementation gas detection module, and uses variety sensors to classify multiple gases. The paper uses Bayesian estimation algorithm to be applied in competitiveness gas detection module and complementation gas detection module, and implement the proposed algorithm to be nice for variety gas sensor combination method. In the competitiveness gas detection module, we use two gas sensors to improve the proposed algorithm to be right. In the complementation gas detection module, we use <b>a</b> NH 3 <b>sensor,</b> <b>an</b> air pollution <b>sensor,</b> <b>an</b> alcohol <b>sensor,</b> <b>a</b> HS <b>sensor,</b> <b>a</b> smoke <b>sensor,</b> <b>a</b> CO <b>sensor,</b> <b>a</b> LPG <b>sensor</b> and <b>a</b> nature gas <b>sensor,</b> and can classify variety gases using Bayesian estimation algorithm. The controller of the two gas detection modules is HOLTEK microchip. The modules can communicate with the supervised computer via wire series interface or wireless RF interface, and cautions the user by the voice module. Finally, we present some experimental results to measure know and unknown gas using the two gas detection modules on the security system of the intelligent building...|$|R

5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior {{to the destruction of}} the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{recorded}} incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning {{early in the}} CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> to force the combustor to continuously ignite under these conditions.|$|E

The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps.

5|$|After the Hungarian Grand Prix on 13 August, {{five teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit on 15–17 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Frentzen. Williams test driver Bruno Junqueira's car had a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen's Arrows car had <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> failure, limiting his team's testing time; the car's floor {{had to be removed}} to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher's car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with test driver Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.|$|E
5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of <b>a</b> <b>sensor</b> coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E
