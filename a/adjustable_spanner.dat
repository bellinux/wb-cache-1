500|$|Clamp {{designed}} Syaoran {{using the}} ideas of manga author Osamu Tezuka and his Star System. Syaoran was based on Syaoran Li, a character from Cardcaptor Sakuraanother series written by Clamp. Syaoran and Sakura were chosen to be the series' protagonist because their Cardcaptor Sakura counterparts had a happy ending, but Clamp said that the characters {{would have to go}} throughout the series to get their own happy ending. At the start of the manga, Syaoran's character was already planned to go through development. The characters Fai D. Flowright and [...] were added to provide additional characters who were older than Syaoran. In early versions of the manga, Syaoran was portrayed as a mechanic rather than an archaeologist, with Fujitaka having taught him about machines. In the original design, Syaoran wore a cap, a different outfit and an enormous <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Johansson also {{improved}} the <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner,</b> patenting in 1891.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} forms of <b>adjustable</b> <b>{{spanners}},</b> from the taper locking spanners which needed a hammer to set the movable jaw {{to the size of}} the nut, to the modern screw adjusted <b>spanner.</b> Some <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanners</b> automatically adjust {{to the size of the}} nut. Simpler models use a serrated edge to lock the movable jaw to size, while more sophisticated versions are digital types that use sheets or feelers to set the size.|$|R
5000|$|The type of {{straight}} <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> with jaws {{at right angles}} to the handle shown here as an [...] "English Key" [...] is mainly called a [...] "King Dick" [...] spanner in the United Kingdom because of a popular British brand of small, handy and reliable <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> used throughout the 1900s and used in great numbers during World War II.|$|E

5000|$|Johan Petter Johansson (December 12, 1853 [...] - [...] August 25, 1943), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} JP, was a Swedish inventor and industrialist. He invented a modern <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> [...] (patents in 1891 and 11 May 1892). He obtained over 100 patents in total.|$|E
50|$|In Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), spanner is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-ended spanner and ring spanner. The term wrench is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or {{may be used for}} a monkey wrench - an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{an image of}} Miffy holding an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> coyly behind her back {{appeared}} on flyers produced by people taking direct action against the UK government's road building program. This unauthorised use of the character spread and Miffy became a mascot for groups involved in radical ecological direct action.|$|E
50|$|Berndt August Hjorth came to Sweden in 1881. In 1889 {{he opened}} a tools and {{machinery}} shop in Stockholm, BA Hjorth & Co, incorporated as a shareholder company in 1916 and in 1954 renamed Bahco. The following year, he made an exclusive contract with Johan Petter Johansson to market his invention, an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner.</b>|$|E
50|$|An <b>{{adjustable}}</b> <b>spanner</b> (UK, {{and most}} other English-speaking countries) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada) is an open-end wrench with a movable jaw, allowing it {{to be used with}} different sizes of fastener head (nut, bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner. Several other names are in use, including the US trademark crescent wrench.|$|E
50|$|The monkey wrench, {{known as}} gas grips in the UK, is an {{adjustable}} wrench, a later American development of eighteenth-century English coach wrenches. It was {{popular in the}} {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries but is now used only for heavier tasks, having been mostly replaced by the lighter and sleeker shifting <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner.</b> The term monkey wrench is also used colloquially to refer to the pipe wrench, owing to their broadly similar shapes.|$|E
50|$|One {{common type}} of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned {{anticlockwise}} by hand until the chain wraps itself tightly around the filter. A socket wrench or <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> is then used to turn the hexagonal bar further in the same direction. This increases {{the tension in the}} chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the oil filter which helps prevent slippage.|$|E
50|$|This {{can be done}} on a show-by-show basis, or as a {{resident}} position of a specific theatre. The tool of the trade of the theatrical master electrician is the <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> or crescent wrench, used to secure stage lighting instruments from lighting positions in the theatre. This wrench is typically attached to the belt or wrist with a lanyard, which is important because the master electrician tends to work at great height, from ladders, lift tables, catwalks, or lighting trusses, where a falling wrench may hurt people or damage property below.|$|E
5000|$|He {{eventually}} {{decided to}} start his own business and, in 1886, moved to Enköping where he started Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad (the Mechanical Workshop of Enköping) which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> and the plumber wrench. In 1890, B.A. Hjorth & Company agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the [...] "Bahco" [...] trademark. The Bahco tools became greatly successful, and the company is still in operation and has manufactured over 100 million wrenches to date.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, the <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> (adjustable wrench) is colloquially {{referred}} to as a [...] "crescent wrench" [...] due to the widespread Crescent brand of adjustable wrenches. The Crescent brand of hand tools is owned and marketed by [...] Apex Tool Group, LLC. In some parts of Europe, adjustable spanners are often called a Bahco. This term refers to the company of the Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson, which was originally called B.A. (Bernt August) Hjort & Company. The Swedes themselves call the key [...] "skiftnyckel" [...] which is translated into adjustable key (shifting key).|$|E
5000|$|In the 1820s Edwin Beard Budding, a {{machinist}} or [...] "mechanician", {{was employed}} by Edward's son, John, at Thrupp. It was while Budding {{was working at}} Thrupp that Lewis' machine was developed to use rotary cutters, and Budding realised that this machine could be adapted for other purposes. Using gears, a revolving horizontal shaft and three blades he developed a machine to cut grass, which until then had been cut manually, using a scythe. This resulted in the world's first lawn mower being invented at Thrupp. It received its patent in 1830. Budding is also credited with {{the invention of the}} screw <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner.</b>|$|E

English engineer Richard Clyburn is credited with inventing an <b>adjustable</b> <b>spanner</b> in 1842. Another English engineer, Edwin Beard Budding, is also credited with the invention. Improvements followed: on 22 September 1885 Enoch Harris received US patent 326868 for his spanner that permitted both the jaw width and {{the angle of the}} handles to be adjusted and locked. Other countries, like Denmark, Poland and Israel, refer to it as a Swedish key. Swedish company Bahco attributes an improved design, in 1891 or 1892, to Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson. who in 1892 received a patent Johansson's spanner was a further development of Clyburn's original [...] "screw spanner". In some countries (e.g. Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Serbia, Iran, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland, Croatia, Romania, and Bulgaria) it is called [...] "French key" [...] (in Poland, [...] "Swedish" [...] or [...] "French" [...] key depending on type). In Canada and the United States, the tool is known as a Crescent wrench or an adjustable wrench.|$|E
