One excellent example of this syntrophy is interspecies hydrogen transfer.

The accumulating hydrogen inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allow continued growth. In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when protons are used as electron acceptor with concurrent H2 production. Hydrogen-consuming organisms include methanogens, sulfate-reducers, acetogens, and others. Some fermentation products, such as fatty acids longer than two carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atom, and branched-chain and aromatic fatty acids, cannot directly be used in methanogenesis.

40|$|Methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis occur {{simultaneously}} in the hindguts {{of almost all}} termites, but {{the reasons for the}} apparent predominance of methanogenesis over homoacetogenesis in the hindgut of the humivorous species is not known. We found that in gut homogenates of soil-feeding Cubitermes spp., methanogens outcompete homoacetogens for endogenous reductant. The rates of methanogenesis were always significantly higher than those of reductive <b>acetogenesis,</b> whereas the stimulation of <b>acetogenesis</b> by the addition of exogenous H 2 or formate was more pronounced than that of methanogenesis. In a companion paper, we reported that the anterior gut regions of Cubitermes spp. accumulated hydrogen to high partial pressures, whereas H 2 was always below the detection limit (< 100 Pa) in the posterior hindgut, and that all hindgut compartments turned into efficient H 2 sinks when external H 2 was provided (D. Schmitt-Wagner and A. Brune, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65 : 4490 – 4496, 1999). Using a microinjection technique, we found that only the posterior gut sections P 3 / 4 a and P 4 b, which harbored methanogenic activities, formed labeled acetate from H 14 CO 3 −. Enumeration of methanogenic and homoacetogenic populations in the different gut sections confirmed the coexistence of both metabolic groups in the same compartments.

Negligible endogenous acetogenic activity was demonstrated in incubations containing ruminal contents, NaH 13 CO 3, and 100 % H 2 gas phase since [U- 13 C]acetate, as measured by mass spectroscopy, did not accumulate. Enhancement of <b>acetogenesis</b> was observed in these incubations when methanogenesis was inhibited by BES and/or by the addition of an axenic culture of the rumen acetogen Acetitomaculum ruminis 190 A 4 (10 7 CFU/ ml).

40|$|AbstractAcetogenesis {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{metabolic}} processes on Earth, and still has a major global significance. In this process, acetate is produced via the reduction and condensation of two carbon dioxide molecules. It has long been assumed that <b>acetogenesis</b> requires ferredoxin with an exceptionally low reduction potential of ≈− 500 mV in order to drive CO 2 reduction to CO and the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate. However, no other metabolic pathway requires electron donors with such low reduction potential. Is <b>acetogenesis</b> a special case, necessitating unique cellular conditions? In this paper, I suggest that it is not. Rather, by keeping CO as a bound metabolite, the CO-dehydrogenase-acetyl-CoA-synthase complex can couple the unfavorable CO 2 reduction to CO with the favorable acetyl-CoA synthesis, thus enabling the former process to proceed using ferredoxin of moderate reduction potential of − 400 mV. I further show that pyruvate synthesis can also take place using the same ferredoxins. In fact, the synthesis of pyruvate from CO 2, methylated-protein-carrier and − 400 mV ferredoxins is an energy-neutral process. These findings suggest that <b>acetogenesis</b> can take place at normal cellular redox state. Mechanistic coupling of reactions as suggested here can flatten energetic landscapes and diminish thermodynamic barriers and can be another role for enzymatic complexes common in nature and a useful tool for metabolic engineering...|$|E
