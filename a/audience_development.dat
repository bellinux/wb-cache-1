Thomas was succeeded in the post in 2016 by Bruce Boucher, former director of the Fralin Museum of Art.|$|E

For their home <b>audiences</b> <b>development</b> organisations need to present bureaucrats who are reliable instruments. In the field these same organisations need staff who can do what makes sense. This arrangement works until what makes sense in head office does not work in the field. At that point staff have to ‘marry off’ these two worlds. How these staff are understood shapes both {{how they can be}} approached by locals and how they should be supported by their organisations. This paper draws on research done in a donor organisation headquarters, in a military unit tasked with conducting development activities and at a field-level donor mission in a failed state. It explores the relevance, methods to research, the plausibility and the productivity of understanding the development bureaucrats who do this ‘marrying off’ as non-unitary subjects...|$|R

40|$|This article {{takes the}} TV-hoax ‘Bye bye Belgium’ as a {{starting}} point to deal with the special linguistic and cultural sensitivities in bilingual Belgium. In the intricate bi- or multilingual context of Belgian politics, ideologically inspired topics are {{not just a matter of}} political conviction. They are also very much a matter of linguistic affiliation and of the way the topics are presented and translated for the <b>audience.</b> <b>Developments</b> in Belgian politics over the last decades have been characterised by the existence of large-scale political agreements and compromises between the members of the two main language communities. These agreements seem to be the only way to solve nationalistically based differences of opinion and to bridge the cultural and political gap between the two communities. Sometimes, compromises can only be reached through an extremely well-balanced formulation containing varying points of emphasis in each language. Thus, the framework of the discussion is very different in the northern and the southern parts of the country, as the TV-programme illustrates. Modern media coverage stimulates the use of conflict frames and as such works counterproductive to the fragile political compromise model in Belgium. status: publishe...|$|R
