5000|$|The dish of a wheel {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total dish of the wheel. Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the <b>axle</b> <b>spindle.</b> Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|E
40|$|By {{fatigue tests}} under {{simulated}} {{operational loading conditions}} on forged spindels, hubs and axles of commercial vehicles {{as well as on}} test specimens taken from the components, the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction using conventional local strain approach was controlled. The material data for the life prediction were determined on the specimens machined out of the critical areas of the components. For the component tests service-like stress-time histories with mean stress variation (spindle) and without (hub) as well as load time histories with a Gaussian frequency distribution (<b>axle,</b> <b>spindle)</b> were used. The comparison of the calculated fatigue life of the components, based on the material data, with the experimentally obtained life shows, that a reliable fatigue life prediction with the conventional local strain approach is not achieved. The accuracy of the fatigue life prediction should be improved by a systematic, phenomenologic description of the decisive effects...|$|E

50|$|There is some {{disagreement}} as {{to whether}} the word <b>axle</b> or <b>spindle</b> should be used in particular contexts. The distinction is based on whether the axle/spindle is stationary, as that in a hub, or rotates, as that in a bottom bracket. American bicycle mechanic and author Sheldon Brown uses <b>axle</b> once and <b>spindle</b> four times in his bottom bracket glossary entry. This article uses spindle throughout for consistency.|$|R
5000|$|The 47/32 {{was built}} in two versions, the first with semi-pneumatic disk wheels, and the second (in 1939, from which the name 47/32 mod. 39) with {{improved}} barrel and suspension (in some series also light-alloy wheels with semi-pneumatic tires). To tow this piece, the Fiat-OCI 708 CM tractor and the L3 tankette were used, but these projects were soon abandoned as the gun was subjected to breaking at the <b>axles</b> <b>spindles</b> and shanks. Due to its shape, the 47/32 was commonly called [...] "elefantino" [...] (little elephant) by the troops.|$|R
50|$|A detent is {{a device}} used to {{mechanically}} resist or arrest {{the rotation of}} a wheel, <b>axle,</b> or <b>spindle.</b> Such a device can be anything ranging from a simple metal pin to a machine. The term is also used for the method involved.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{finish and}} {{dimensional}} accuracy {{play a vital}} role in the todayâ€™s engineering industry. There are several methods used to achieve good surface finish like burnishing, honing and lapping, and grinding. Grinding is one of these ways that improves the surface finish and dimensional accuracy simultaneously. C 40 E steel has good industrial application in manufacturing of shafts, <b>axles,</b> <b>spindles,</b> studs, etc. In the present work the cylindrical grinding of C 40 E steel is done for the optimization of grinding process parameters. During this experimental work input process parameters i. e. speed, feed, depth of cut is optimized using Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) concluded that surface roughness is minimum at the 210 rpm, 0. 11 mm/rev feed, and 0. 04 mm depth of penetration. ...|$|R

50|$|To {{avoid using}} frame-mounted motors and jackshafts, some {{designers}} {{decided to use}} axle-mounted motors, driving each wheel directly, with the <b>axle</b> forming the <b>spindle</b> of not only the wheels, but also the motor armature itself. This obviously simple system had been used before, but only for low-powered locomotives with lightweight motors. As the wheels and axle, {{and in this case}} the motor too, are unsprung by the suspension, any extra weight here would lead to poor riding qualities. To permit its use for high-horsepower locomotives, the motor was split in two. The armature was formed as part of the axle, but the much heavier field poles and coils were carried on the suspended frame of the locomotive. This setup managed to produce acceptable quality.|$|R
50|$|Most {{household}} {{door handles}} use a simple mechanism with a screw-style <b>axle</b> (called a <b>spindle)</b> that {{has at least}} one flat side, which is passed through the door jigger, leaving some length exposed {{on each side of the}} door to which the handles are attached. Some handles are attached on both sides by screwing or sliding them directly onto the spindle, and then securing one or more retaining screws (set screws) through the knob perpendicular to the flat of the spindle. Handles that lose traction can frequently be repaired by replacing or adjusting the set screw, which prevents them from slipping on the spindle. Other types of handles, typically used in Europe, slide onto the spindle but are affixed only to the door itself without use of set screws.|$|R

It is a capable of machining geometrically complex or hard material components, that are precise and difficult-to-machine such as heat treated tool steels, composites, super alloys, ceramics, carbides, heat resistant steels etc. being widely used in die and mold making industries, aerospace, aeronautics and nuclear industries.

50|$|Sheep's wool, or mah-too-EHL-kel, is {{the most}} common {{material}} used for modern Salish weaving. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go through most of the traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and carded wool directly from a commercial carding mill. The fleece is lightly washed in a tub of tepid water and then hung outside to dry. It is then teased or picked apart with fingers to remove any matted areas and loose dirt. The wool is then carded, leaving the wool in soft batts, where the fibers lie lengthwise. Taken to the spinning machine, the wool is deftly hand fed into the <b>axle</b> of the <b>spindle.</b> This separates sections of the batt of wool and allows the desired amount of spinning to take place before the tension is eased to wind the wool onto the spindle. When the spindle has filled, the wool is unwound and stored in balls or skeins.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor obtaining close {{fits and}} tolerances, {{certain amount of}} {{machining}} has {{to be carried out}} on GFRP (Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic) composites, produced by primary manufacturing processes. A number of cylindrical GFRP composite parts are finish machined by turning. These include <b>axles,</b> bearings, <b>spindles,</b> rolls and steering columns. There is always a tradeoff between quality and productivity during machining operations. Hence it becomes essential to evaluate the optimal cutting parameters setting in order to satisfy these opposing requirements. In this study, a hybrid multiobjective optimization algorithm involving grey and fuzzy coupled with Taguchi methodology is used. Four process parameters, each at three levels are selected for the study viz. cutting tool nose radius, cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Surface roughness parameter Ra, tangential cutting force Fz and material removal rate MRR are the chosen output performance measures. The experimental plan is laid according to Taguchi's orthogonal array L 27. Woven fabric based GFRP/ Epoxy tubes produced using hand layup process are finish turned using PCD cutting tool. Grey relational coefficients of the three performance measures are converted into a single multi performance characteristics index (MPCI) using Mamdani type fuzzy inference system. This MPCI is then optimized using Taguchi analysis. The parameter combination of A 2 B 1 C 1 D 3, i. e. tool nose radius of 0. 8 mm, cutting speed of 120 m/min, feed rate of 0. 05 mm/rev and depth of cut of 1. 6 mm, is evaluated as the optimum combination. The confirmatory experiment at these settings gave maximum value of MPCI, validating the results...|$|R
40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} cold forming process for rods and tubes {{and has a}} wide spread use in the automotive industry for the manufacture of <b>axles</b> or steering <b>spindles.</b> The advantage of rotary swaging is the optimal use of work piece material resources, due to material strengthening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. The established processes use lubricants which fulfil necessary functions such as cooling, washing abrasive particles out of the forming zone and to provide an adequate work piece surface quality. Both, under economic and ecological aspects, the development of rotary swaging towards a dry process layout is highly innovative. To avoid ex-tensive lubrication it is necessary to substitute the above mentioned functions of the lubricant by new innovative ap-proaches. This work shows an interdisciplinary approach for dry rotary swaging, at first a FE modelling and simulation of the rotary swaging process for understanding and designing a dry process. Furthermore, coated tools are presented for the reduction of abrasive and adhesive wear of the tool and structured tools for the control of friction and process forces. At last the combination of both tool modifications is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In the {{automobile}} industry, {{it is important}} to identify the major noise sources and to find the relationship between them and the interior noise of an automobile. The noise sources include engine noise and vibration, tire noise, exhaust noise and transmission noise. The objective of the research was the prediction of the sound pressure level occurring inside the passenger compartment of an automobile, by using as simple a model as possible. ^ In building reduced models by using measurement data from an automobile, some frequency domain techniques have been used. New and extended techniques have been developed to assist building more accurate reduced models of automobile interior noise. Some time domain techniques have also been investigated. In certain applications, for example, active noise control, one would wish to predict passenger car noise in real time from measurements in the engine or from <b>axle</b> and <b>spindle</b> vibration. In other applications, for example, sound quality design, one would wish to run several predictions in a timely fashion in order to make comparisons. In these applications we derive a simple model that can predict the passenger compartment noise accurately and quickly, and has components that can be related to physical mechanisms within the car so that the effect of design changes can be embedded into the model. While including all major sources of passenger car noise, the objective in building the simplified models was to use the smallest number of transducers and the simplest models possible. ^ Torsional vibration is an implicit excitation that exists in an operating automobile, and can be a significant noise source. Due to the difficulty of measuring torsional vibration on rotating shafts, it has not often been used as an input to noise models, although torsional vibrations could be a major cause of noise inside a passenger car. In previous studies, torsional vibration in the power train of {{the automobile}} was found to be the source of the booming noise, the correlation between the torsional vibration in the drive line and the low frequency noise in an automobile. A low cost and effective torsional vibration measurement system has been designed to assist the measurement of the torsional vibration of a shaft. The measurement system was applied to a rotating shaft on a test bench; results indicate that this method can be used on an operating automobile to measure the torsional vibration on the wheel axle. ...|$|R
40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} cold forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical light weight components such as <b>axles</b> and steering <b>spindles</b> and has a wide spread use in the automotive industry. The advantage of rotary swaging is the optimal use of work piece material resources. This is due to material strengthening through strain hardening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. However, main drawback is the need for an extensive lubrication to control tool wear, to discharge abrasive particles from the forming zone, and to provide adequate work piece surface quality. The subsequent, inevitable cleaning of the work pieces after manufacture leads to a significant increase of costs per unit. Thus, the development of rotary swaging towards a dry process layout is highly innovative both under economic and ecological aspects. The omission of lubricant provokes fundamentally changed tribological conditions in tool-work piece contact, leading to changes in process forces, increased abrasive and adhesive tool wear and reduced work piece quality. A robust, lubricant free rotary swaging, offering the same product quality as a conventional rotary swaging process with the use of lubricant, therefore implies the control of the modified tribological properties by methodologies substituting the tasks of the lubricant. This work shows an interdisciplinary approach for the development of dry rotary swaging, that comprises the FE modeling and simulation of the rotary swaging process for general process understanding and designing; the micro structuring of the rotary swaging tool surfaces for control of friction and process forces; and the development of tungsten doped a-C:H tool hard coatings for the reduction of abrasive and adhesive wear of the tools...|$|R
