40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare {{the effects of a}} non-linguistic {{auditory}} intervention approach with a phonological intervention approach on the phonological skills of children with speech sound disorder. A total of 17 children, aged 7 - 12 years, with speech sound disorder were randomly allocated to either the non-linguistic auditory temporal intervention group (n = 10, average age 7. 7 ± 1. 2) or phonological intervention group (n = 7, average age 8. 6 ± 1. 2). The intervention outcomes included auditory-sensory measures (auditory temporal processing skills) and cognitive measures (attention, short-term memory, speech production and phonological awareness skills). The <b>auditory</b> <b>approach</b> focused on non-linguistic auditory training (eg. backward masking and frequency discrimination), whereas the phonological approach focused on speech sound training (eg. phonological organisation and awareness). Both interventions consisted of twelve 45 -minute sessions delivered twice per week, for a total of nine hours. Intra-group analysis demonstrated that the auditory intervention group showed significant gains in both auditory and cognitive measures, whereas no significant gain was observed in the phonological intervention group. No significant improvement on phonological skills was observed in any of the groups. Inter-group analysis demonstrated significant differences between the improvement following training for both groups, with a more pronounced gain for the non-linguistic auditory temporal intervention in one of the visual attention measures and both auditory measures. Therefore, both analyses suggest that although the non-linguistic auditory intervention approach appeared to be the most effective intervention approach, it was not sufficient to promote the enhancement of phonological skills...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the narrative and auditory {{elements of the}} podcast series “Historien om Lukas” by the digital magazine Third Ear and the journalist Jakob Sheikh. The study revolves around how the above-mentioned elements contribute to maintain the listener’s attention, {{in spite of the}} fact that the death of the main character is already being uncovered in the beginning of the story. This study will commence with two different analyses, respectively a narrative and an <b>auditory</b> <b>approach.</b> Additionally, it will use an interview conducted with one of the creators of the podcast, Jakob Sheikh. This facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the combined effects that are being used in the podcast series. Different approaches to new journalism and auditory effects serve as the theoretical framework in which “Historien om Lukas” will be discussed. The specific works for new journalism include Rie Pedersens Fortællende journalistik and John Christian Jørgensens Journalistik med stil - Fra klassiske nyheder til fortælling, whereas the specific works for the auditory effect are Ib Poulsens Radiomontagen og dens rødder and Hanne Bruun og Kirsten Frandsens ”Radioæstetik og analysemetode”. Furthermore, this study will include a discussion of how the podcast differs from other forms of media as the book, and how the authenticity of the auditory effects has been a central part of the production of the podcast This paper argues that it is the combination of the narrative and auditory effects that serves as the foundation of the plot. Furthermore, it argues that the listener’s attention is maintained through the emotional and physical journey of the main character which functions as the story’s suspense...|$|E

40|$|Many {{television}} experiences {{depend on}} users being both {{willing and able}} to visually attend to screen-based information. Auditory displays offer an alternative method for presenting this information and could benefit all users. This thesis explores how this may be achieved through the design and evaluation of auditory displays involving varying degrees of concurrency for two television use cases: menu navigation and presenting related content alongside a television show. The first study, on the navigation of auditory menus, looked at onset asynchrony and word length in the presentation of spoken menus. The effects of these on task duration, accuracy and workload were considered. Onset asynchrony and word length both caused significant effects on task duration and accuracy, while workload was only affected by onset asynchrony. An optimum asynchrony was identified, which was the same for both long and short words, but better performance was obtained with the shorter words that no longer overlapped. The second experiment investigated how disruption, workload, and preference are affected when presenting additional content accompanying a television programme. The content took the form of sound from different spatial locations or as text on a smartphone and the programme's soundtrack was either modified or left unaltered. Leaving the soundtrack unaltered or muting it negatively impacted user experience. Removing the speech from the television programme and presenting the secondary content as sound from a smartphone was the best <b>auditory</b> <b>approach.</b> This was found to compare well with the textual presentation, resulting in less visual disruption and imposing a similar workload. Additionally, the thesis reviews the state-of-the-art in television experiences and auditory displays. The human auditory system is introduced and important factors in the concurrent presentation of speech are highlighted. Conclusions about the utility of concurrency within auditory displays for television are made and areas for further work are identified...|$|E

Additionally, web users constitute a highly heterogeneous entities with different needs and requirements. Considering this, user adaptive software systems have been developed as a new application approach to ease the interaction between users and web information {{with the intent to}} bridge the gap between such presentation and navigational pitfalls. The user adaptive interaction is especially useful when considering a marginalized group such as blind and visually impaired users. This paper attempts at providing an overview of a state-of-the-art survey concerning adaptive interaction between users and web information space with special emphasis on exploiting methods and techniques for adaptive web accessibility for blind and visually impaired people. Likewise, the exploration of possibilities of new methods and techniques for user adapted interaction for blind and visually impaired is highly required in order to alleviate the accessibility according to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Recent studies indicate that even when the guidelines are implemented on web information systems, there is little indication that people with disabilities will gain better accessibility.

40|$|Realizing the {{decoding}} {{of brain}} signals into control commands, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) aim {{to establish an}} alternative communication pathway for locked-in patients. In contrast to most visual BCI approaches which use event-related potentials (ERP) of the electroencephalogram, auditory BCI systems are challenged with ERP responses, which are less class-discriminant between attended and unattended stimuli. Furthermore, these <b>auditory</b> <b>approaches</b> have more complex interfaces which imposes a substantial workload on their users. Aiming for a maximally user-friendly spelling interface, this study introduces a novel auditory paradigm: "CharStreamer". The speller {{can be used with}} an instruction as simple as "please attend to what you want to spell". The stimuli of CharStreamer comprise 30 spoken sounds of letters and actions. As each of them is represented by the sound of itself and not by an artificial substitute, it can be selected in a one-step procedure. The mental mapping effort (sound stimuli to actions) is thus minimized. Usability is further accounted for by an alphabetical stimulus presentation: contrary to random presentation orders, the user can foresee the presentation time of the target letter sound. Healthy, normal hearing users (n =  10) of the CharStreamer paradigm displayed ERP responses that systematically differed between target and non-target sounds. Class-discriminant features, however, varied individually from the typical N 1 -P 2 complex and P 3 ERP components found in control conditions with random sequences. To fully exploit the sequential presentation structure of CharStreamer, novel data analysis approaches and classification methods were introduced. The results of online spelling tests showed that a competitive spelling speed can be achieved with CharStreamer. With respect to user rating, it clearly outperforms a control setup with random presentation sequences...|$|R

The advent of multiple channel cochlear implants for children and the continuing development of multiple channel speech processing tactile devices provide <b>auditory</b> <b>approaches</b> to resolving communication difficulties for these children. The successful use of such devices depends on a number of factors including the information provided through the aid; the ease of use, convenience and reliability of the aid; the individual communication needs of the child; and the habilitation and management program used with the device. Long-term data has shown that children continue to show increased speech perception benefits from improvements in speech processing and from further experience with these devices.
