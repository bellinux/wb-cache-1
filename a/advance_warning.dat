5|$|Hurricane Dean's {{smooth and}} well-predicted track gave unusually <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> {{to all of}} the nations in its path and allowed them time to prepare for the storm's impact. Because of the <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> and Dean's {{extraordinary}} strength, the nations of Central America and the Caribbean set up hundreds of shelters, readied thousands of disaster recovery experts, evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents, and prepared millions of dollars of emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the United States, Hurricane Carol caused $461million in damage, {{mostly in}} New England, {{making it the}} costliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} at the time. There were 65deaths in New England, and about 1,000injured people. Despite the high damage, <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> allowed for many fewer deaths than the total of 488fatalities during the 1938 New England hurricane, which affected the same area with similar strength. However, some areas did not receive <b>advance</b> <b>warning,</b> due to power outages preventing people from receiving Weather Bureau warnings ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Puerto Rico, {{the hurricane}} passed {{just north of}} the Dominican Republic, producing very little damage. This was due to the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center. <b>Advance</b> <b>warning</b> reduced the number of ships traversing the region.|$|E

5|$|About 36hours {{prior to}} the {{hurricane}} making landfall, {{when it was still}} south of Cuba, the Miami Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for South Florida. About 18hours before landfall, the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning. The <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E
5|$|On October1, a {{day before}} the {{hurricane}} moved ashore, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm signals from Key West, Florida to Norfolk, Virginia. Similar warnings were issued in the hours preceding the hurricane moving ashore. The advisories were credited with saving dozens of lives {{and millions of dollars}} in shipping cargo, due to <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> for boats to remain ashore.|$|E

40|$|Mike is a 22 year-old adult with CHARGE Syndrome and autism {{spectrum}} conditions. Mike often {{struggles to}} greet and interact appropriately {{when people come}} to visit {{him and his family}} at his house. The purpose of this project was to help Mike improve his greeting and overall social skills. One event that seems to provoke problem behavior in people with autism is sudden unannounced schedule changes. <b>Advanced</b> <b>warning</b> of schedule changes have been used to prepare people with disabilities similar to Mike’s to teach social and behavioral skills. Social stories have also been used as an intervention to give individuals with disabilities scripted information that they can follow in social situations. This study used an <b>advanced</b> <b>warning</b> strategy during intervention 1. This strategy did not prove to be successful. Therefore we implemented a second strategy consisting of an <b>advanced</b> <b>warning</b> as well as a social story intervention. Social stories were created involving Mike and each of his seven nieces and nephews. Baseline data was collected before the interventions were implemented on whether Mike greeted his nieces and nephews in a friendly manner, on Mike’s attitude, outbursts, and on whether he engaged each child in an activity during the visit. This same data was collected during each phase of the study. Intervention one, <b>advanced</b> <b>warning</b> phase proved to be unsuccessful. The second, social story intervention, including an <b>advanced</b> <b>warning</b> plus social story, required Mike to read the social story aloud to an adult before the visiting children arrived. This intervention resulted in an increase in friendly greetings, positive attitude, and involvement in activities with the visiting children. Engaged in activities with the nieces and nephews, and outbursts showed little change. Mikes overall attitude during the visits made some improvement...|$|R

5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> of the expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient <b>advance</b> <b>warning,</b> mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E

5|$|In {{the hours}} {{leading up to}} landfall, the TCWC in Brisbane issued 17 cyclone {{warnings}} for coastal areas. According to the BoM, residents received 20 hours of <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> in which to complete preparations. By late on 23 December, police and ] workers were on alert for the approaching storm. High public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to BoM cyclone awareness initiatives {{in the wake of}} 1970's deadly Cyclone Ada. However, storm victims still criticised the agency and local radio news stations for unclear, untimely, or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion. Significant delays between the issuance of warnings from TCWC Brisbane and local broadcast in the Townsville area raised some question about the need for a warning centre closer to North Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{civil war}} {{had broken out}} in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, {{resulting}} {{in a period of}} chaos known as the Anarchy. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded England during 1137 in support of her claim. Although Miles de Beauchamp declared himself in support of Stephen, the king decided to retake Bedford Castle before marching north. Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> of the attack and took in considerable supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle and left a force under the command of Hugh to starve it into submission whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.|$|E
5|$|Rigorous {{attempts}} to warn of tornadoes {{began in the}} United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, {{with the advent of}} weather radar, areas near a local office could get <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.|$|E
50|$|It is {{reported}} that in 1903 police raided Madam Ida Bailey's Canary Cottage, a house of prostitution in the Stingaree District and that the usual <b>advance</b> <b>warnings</b> were not made. Hence, reputed customers, Mayor Frary and the chief of police, may have been inconvenienced.|$|R

5|$|The third {{significant}} cyclone in 14months {{to affect}} the region, Ivy produced heavy rainfall and high winds in Vanuatu. Due to <b>advance</b> <b>warning,</b> only two people were killed, and several people were injured. The high winds damaged about 11,000houses, leaving many people homeless. The cyclone passed {{very close to the}} Vanuatu capital city of Port Vila, forcing the evacuation of about 2,000people and shutting down the main port. Cyclone Ivy also affected the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia with rainfall, and later it produced high waves in New Zealand that killed two people. Because of its severe damage on Vanuatu, the name Ivy was retired following its usage.|$|E
5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the Research Octane Number (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E
5|$|The 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac {{hurricane}} {{was among}} the most damaging hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. The sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed in the eastern Atlantic, where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A strong ridge over New England allowed a continued northwest course, bringing the storm south of Bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern United States. <b>Advance</b> <b>warning</b> allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall. It did so in northeastern North Carolina on August23 with winds of about 90mph (150km/h). Soon after, the eye crossed over Norfolk, Virginia, the first time that happened since 1821. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern Virginia shortly before passing near Washington, D.C., becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. Curving northward, the storm moved through Pennsylvania and New York before losing tropical characteristics on August25. Now extratropical, the former hurricane moved across Atlantic Canada, dissipating on August28.|$|E

5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E

At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.|$|E
