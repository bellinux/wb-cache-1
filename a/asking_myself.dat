500|$|The character's {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed. Upon DeGarmo joining the show, Luke Kerr of Zap2It was not receptive of the character's concept. He compared her to Snooki {{of the reality}} television series Jersey Shore {{and said that the}} show has fallen under Jersey Shores [...] "drunken spell". He wrote: [...] "Regardless of who portrayed the character—because I have absolutely nothing against DeGarmo—why does Y need yet another big name stunt cast?" [...] Additionally, he said: [...] "every time I read something about the new character I find myself <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> why, just why?" [...] DeGarmo said: [...] "Angelina nor I need to watch ‘Jersey Shore’ for pointers. But we are fans. Definitely Snooki is someone we look up to." ...|$|E
500|$|The inquiry {{was led by}} Detective Inspector Peter Wall of Greater Manchester Police. At 07:30 on 14 December, he {{instructed}} officers to attend 97 Langworthy Road and arrest everyone that they found there. [...] Jean Powell and McNeilly laughed and joked with {{each other as they}} were arrested. Initially, all six denied involvement. Under questioning, Dudson, who had been urged by his father to tell the truth, began to talk. D.I. Wall said of Dudson's statement: [...] "As the story began to unfold, we just couldn't believe it. I kept <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> how one human being could do this to another." [...] Police officers [...] "wept as the extent of Suzanne's suffering was revealed," [...] and together with civilian staff at the station the police collected cash to send flowers to her at the hospital. On 17 December 1992, the six accused appeared before magistrates in Manchester and were remanded into custody charged with kidnapping and attempted murder. Following Capper's death they were charged with her murder on 23 December 1992.|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adkins {{compared}} {{the process of}} writing the album's lyrics to that of the band's third studio album, Clarity (1999), stating: [...] "It's similar to [...] because that's how I approached a lot of emotional things in those days. It's the observation and experience of the world around you, and you develop the ideas from that. It's similar to how I worked on the material for Damage because I'm <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> the same kinds of questions about things, it's just that I'm in a different place in life, a completely different environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the release}} of the Use Your Illusion albums, Stradlin had become {{dissatisfied}} with life in Guns N' Roses. He later recalled, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and <b>asking</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] On November 7, 1991, it was announced that Stradlin had left Guns N' Roses. He had played his final show as an official member of the band on August 31 at Wembley Stadium. Of his reasons for leaving, Stradlin later said, [...] "I didn't like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N' Roses," [...] citing the Riverport riot and Axl Rose's chronic lateness on the Use Your Illusion Tour as examples. He stated that getting sober played a part in his decision to leave, saying, [...] "When you're fucked up, you're more likely to put up with things you wouldn't normally put up with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Debussy's {{great service}} to music was to reawaken among all musicians an {{awareness}} of harmony and its possibilities. In that, {{he was just as}} important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always <b>asking</b> <b>myself</b> is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? [...] Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made Ferruccio Busoni exclaim 'At last something truly new!' [...] Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera Bluebeard's Castle. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and <b>asking</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
