[...] The Health and Improvement Committee of the Thanatopsis asked her {{to take part in the}} <b>anti-fly</b> campaign, and she toiled about town persuading householders to use the fly-traps furnished by the club, or giving out money prizes to fly-swatting children. She was loyal enough but not ardent, and without ever quite intending to, she began to neglect the task as heat sucked at her strength.|$|E

You gave up on the new city hall, the <b>anti-fly</b> campaign, club papers, the library-board, the dramatic association--just because we didn't graduate into Ibsen the very first thing. You want perfection all at once. Do {{you know what the}} finest thing you've done is--aside from bringing Hugh into the world? It was the help you gave Dr. Will during baby-welfare week. You didn't demand that each baby be a philosopher and artist before you weighed him, as you {{do with the rest of}} us.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the breeze and warble flies (H. diana, Ph. picta) of marals. The work {{is aimed at}} {{studying}} the phenology and ecology of the warble and breeze flies of marals in the Mountain Altai and at the development of measures of struggle with them. For {{the first time the}} questions of the ecology and phenology of the breeze and warble flies of the marals, their spreading have been studied. The method of the phenological prognosis of the flies development rate has been developed. The scheme of the calculation of the economic loss sum to be caused by the flies to the maral farming has been offered. For the first time, the episootologic situation on the hypodermatosis and pharyngomyosis of the marals in the Mountain Altai has been studied. The optimal terms of performance of the <b>anti-flies</b> measures with the application of the synthetic pyretroides and parasitocides of the wide spectre of action have been determined. The Instructions 'About Measures on Prophylactic and Therapy of Animal Entomosis' and the recommendations 'The Fly Invasion of Marals of Altai, their Prophylactic and Therapy' have been developedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|During warm, {{sunny days}} (Max. temp. 22 &deg;C to 25 &deg;C) C 02 -baited traps {{operated}} at sites {{on and off}} snow patches (SP's) in subarctic Norway caught significantly fewer culicids, simuliids and tabanids on snow in both 1985 and 1987. However, for overnight catches (18. 30 - 07. 30 h) {{there was no significant}} difference in the number of culicids caught on versus off SP's. Analysis of videotapes taken in 1987 showed that defensive <b>anti-fly</b> behaviors of reindeer on and off SP's remained low (&lt; 1 / 4 min) throughout the day. Based on reindeer <b>anti-fly</b> behaviors, harassment was greatest from 10. 30 to 12. 30 h (Norwegian Standard Time), but reindeer continued to aggregate on SP's while <b>anti-fly</b> behaviors were lowest (13. 30 to 20. 00 h). Groups of &gt; 150 animals often occupied the entire surface of a snow patch. At the fly densities and climatic conditions encountered it seemed apparent that reindeer intermittently used SP's primarily to thermoregulate following periods of foraging. Almost all reindeer remained on SP's from 11. 00 to 12. 30 h, but at other times between 08. 00 and 19 00 h about half the herd (ca. 800 animals) foraged for about an hour while the other half aggregated on SP's. However, by 20. 00 h, during the cooler period when trap catches of mosquitoes were increasing, almost all reindeer had moved off SP's. The small decreases in <b>anti-fly</b> defensive behaviors observed for reindeer on SP's versus animals foraging in snow-free areas indicated that their presence on SP's may have resulted in a minor, coincidental reduction in harassment. Significantly more tabanids were caught during the morning trapping period than at other times, and significantly more mosquitoes were caught during the evening/overnight trapping period than at other times...|$|E
