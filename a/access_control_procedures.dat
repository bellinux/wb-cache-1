Introducing efficient mechanisms for collecting, processing, and delivering data generated by sensors, medical equipment, wearable devices, and humans, is a key enabling factor for advanced healthcare services. The adoption of IoT in smart health, however, opens the doors to some security concerns. In fact, by considering the confidentiality and sensitivity of medical data, a healthcare system must fulfill advanced <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> with strict security and data quality requirements. To this end, a flexible policy enforcement framework, based on the IoT paradigm, is defined hereby.

As a key feature of the proposed framework, cross-domain policies have been defined using a specification language based on XML. In this way, it becomes possible to ease the management of interactions across different realms and policy conflicts.

The <b>procedure</b> includes the design and quantitative evaluation of alternatives to select the best one.

Models are needed to predict delays of arterial streams caused by minor streams at unsignalized intersections. To address this missing component, models were developed to predict the delays caused to arterial streams by the following maneuvers: merging onto the arterial, diverging from the arterial, and left turn from the arterial. Models to predict crash rates for multi-lane arterial segments in Indiana based on geometric and <b>access</b> <b>control</b> characteristics were also developed. Models were developed to predict total, propertydamage- only, and fatal/injury crashes.

40|$|Access {{control in}} medical {{information}} systems distributed over the Internet {{is an important}} issue directly related to the protection of patients' privacy. It is therefore essential to satisfy the increasing demand for exploiting Internet mechanisms in order to achieve a secure health information network. This can only be done however only if it can be guaranteed that appropriate measures have been taken to preserve a satisfactory level of security for the information concerned. Recent efforts in this direction rely on public-key cryptography and digital certificates. Identity certificates are suitable for identification and authentication purposes. In addition, attribute certificates are another type of certificates that are particularly suitable for authorization purposes. In order to fully exploit digital certificates to protect distributed healthcare applications over the Internet, we propose the use of a third type of certificates, called access-rule certificates, which are useful for the enforcement of global access control mechanisms between different organizations. In this paper, we present the structure of those three types of certificates, as well as the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> when using them and we describe the architecture of the proposed system whose purpose is to explore the use of certificates for the implementation of a suitable security policy for healthcare environments.

The focus of the analysis has been to provide {{an overview of the}}ir database services as well as the available security measurements.

This thesis looks into existing solutions for the authentication step of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> in large data centers, and analyses how two authentication systems, Kerberos and PKI, will perform when employed on a larger scale, beyond what is normal in a large data center today. The emphasis in the analysis is on possible bottlenecks in the system, computational power spent on <b>access</b> <b>control</b> routines, <b>procedures</b> for administration and key distribution and availability of extension features needed in large scale data center scenarios. Our administration analysis will propose and present possible methods for initial key distribution to new machines in the data center, as well as methods for enrolling new users. We will also propose a method for automatic service instantiation in Kerberos and present a method for service instantiation in PKI. We will look at how the systems handle failed machines in the network, and look at how the systems handle breaches of trusted components. Our performance analysis will show that under given assumptions, both Kerberos and PKI will handle the average load in a hypothetical data center consisting of 100000 machines and 1000 users. We will also see that under an assumed peak load, Kerberos will be able to handle 10000 service requests in under 1 second, whereas the PKI solution would need at least 15 seconds to handle the same number of requests using recommended public key sizes. This means that some programs may need special configurations to work in a PKI system under high load. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) within healthcare organizations has {{the main goal}} of integrating heterogeneous patient information that is usually scattered over different locations. However, there are some barriers that impede the effective integration of EMR within the healthcare practice (e. g., educational, time/costs, security). A focus in improving access control definition and implementation is fundamental to define proper system workflow and access. The main objectives of this research are: to involve end users {{in the definition of}} access control rules; to determine which access control rules are important to those users; to define an access control model that can model these rules; and to implement and evaluate this model. Technical, methodological and legislative reviews were conducted on access control both in general and the healthcare domain. Grounded theory was used together with mixed methods to gather users experiences and needs regarding access control. Focus groups (main qualitative method) followed by structured questionnaires (secondary quantitative method) were applied to the healthcare professionals whilst structured telephone interviews were applied to the patients. A list of access control rules together with the new Break-The-Glass (BTG) RBAC model were developed. A prototype together with a pilot case study was implemented in order to test and evaluate the new model. A research process was developed during this work that allows translating <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> in healthcare, from legislation to practice, in a systematic and objective way. With access controls closer to the healthcare practice, educational, time/costs and security barriers of EMR integration can be minimized. This is achieved by: reducing the time needed to learn, use and alter the system; allowing unanticipated or emergency situations to be tackled in a controlled manner (BTG) and reducing unauthorized and non-justified accesses.
