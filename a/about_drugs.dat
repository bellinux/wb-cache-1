5|$|Traffic was {{originally}} {{going to be}} distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into turnaround unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in Traffic, Fox's interest in the film was renewed, and the studio took it out of turnaround. Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio {{by the time the}} first draft was finished. It went back into turnaround. Mechanic had also wanted to make some changes to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film <b>about</b> <b>drugs,</b> according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.|$|E

500|$|While {{there has}} been {{speculation}} that the song is <b>about</b> <b>drugs</b> such as LSD or marijuana, particularly with lines such as [...] "take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship" [...] and [...] "the smoke rings of my mind", Dylan has always denied the song is <b>about</b> <b>drugs.</b> Though he was using marijuana {{at the time the}} song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or muse, or the singer's search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book Like a Complete Unknown that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.|$|E

[...] Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. [...] This resulted in [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] being banned {{in a number of}} states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. [...] However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating [...] "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it." [...] Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that [...] "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was <b>about</b> <b>drugs,</b> it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just <b>about</b> <b>drugs.</b> It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do." ...|$|E

Though {{the majority of the}} album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and The Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on [...] "St. Ides Heaven", and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on [...] "Single File". Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being <b>about</b> <b>drugs</b> specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him [...] "a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person" [...] and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.|$|E

I don't want to have to take it– I have too much respect for my body." [...] Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked <b>about</b> <b>drugs</b> by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.|$|E

500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Artificial Energy", {{features}} a prominent horn section and as such, {{can be seen}} as a stylistic relative of [...] "Lady Friend" [...] and [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star", two earlier Byrds' songs that made use of brass. The song deals with the dark side of amphetamine use and it was Chris Hillman who initially suggested that the band should [...] "write a song about speed". The title was suggested by drummer Michael Clarke, and his input in the creation of the song was sufficient to afford him a rare writing credit. Although the song's lyrics initially seem to be extolling the virtues of amphetamines, the tale turns darker in the final verse when it becomes apparent that the drug taker has been imprisoned for murdering a homosexual man, as evidenced by the song's final couplet: [...] "I'm coming down off amphetamine/And I'm in jail 'cause I killed a queen." [...] Although the press had accused the Byrds of writing songs <b>about</b> <b>drugs</b> in the past, specifically with [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] and [...] "5D (Fifth Dimension)", when the band finally did record a song unequivocally dealing with drugs it was largely ignored by journalists.|$|E
