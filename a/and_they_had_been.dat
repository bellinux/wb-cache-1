5|$|In 1959, Lemon {{became a}} scout for Cleveland. The next season, {{he became a}} coach with the Indians. In 1961, he joined the Philadelphia Phillies {{coaching}} staff. The California Angels hired him as their pitching coach for 1967–1968. In 1976, Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees. The Yankees were owned by Cleveland-area native George Steinbrenner <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon's pitching years. In recognition of his election to the Hall of Fame, Lemon was named honorary captain of the AL team for the All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E

5|$|Following these failed German offensives, {{the town}} of Falaise became a major {{objective}} of Commonwealth forces, since its capture would cut off virtually all of Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge's Army Group B. To achieve this, General Harry Crerar, commanding the newly formed Canadian 1st Army and Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—commanding the Canadian II Corps, planned an Anglo-Canadian offensive with the code name of Operation Totalize. This offensive was designed {{to break through the}} defences in the Anglo-Canadian sector of the Normandy front. Operation Totalize would rely on an unusual night attack using heavy bombers and the new Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers to achieve a breakthrough of German defences. Despite initial gains on Verrières Ridge and near Cintheaux, the Canadian Army's offensive stalled on 9 August, with strong Wehrmacht counterattacks resulting in heavy casualties for the Canadian and Polish armoured and infantry divisions. By 10 August, Canadian troops had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise. They were unable to advance farther immediately <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to capture Falaise.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian {{had been}} elected King of the Romans in 1486 on his father's initiative, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ruling jointly since then. Upon the death of Frederick in 1493, Maximilian also took over his father's {{possessions}} and thus united the whole Habsburg territory in his hands. In the same year, the Peace of Senlis also {{marked the end of}} his wars against the French about his Burgundian possessions; he kept the territories in the Netherlands and also the County of Burgundy, but had to cede the Duchy of Burgundy to the French king. Maximilian controlled thus territories that nearly encircled the Old Swiss Confederacy: Tyrol and Vorarlberg in the east, Further Austria in the north, and the County of Burgundy in the west.|$|E

25|$|On February 18, 1862, Colonel Arno Voss took brief {{temporary}} {{command of}} the camp until Colonel Tucker returned from Springfield, Illinois several days later. Voss had to prepare for arrival on February 20, 1862 of the first prisoners from Fort Donelson, who found a camp but no real prison. For the first few days, they were housed in the White Oak Square section, along with newly trained Union soldiers about to depart for service at the front. The army sent sick prisoners to the camp, although it had no medical facilities at the time, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> advised not to do so.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{could not}} attack land forces, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{frustrated}} {{in attempts to}} engage the allied squadron at sea. The Spanish ships were isolated, short of supplies and losing hope of victory. When the Chilean government ordered that all vessels communicating with the Spanish fleet should be barred from Chilean ports, Admiral Mendez Núñez decided to take punitive actions against the allied ports. The Spanish fleet shelled and burned the town and port of Valparaiso on March 31, and destroyed Chile's merchant fleet. All told, thirty-three vessels were burned or sunk. The damage to the Chilean merchant marine was catastrophic. Twelve years later, the total tonnage under the Chilean flag was still {{less than half of}} what it had been in 1865.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, {{the city}} of Cascade Locks, Oregon and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is using water for a salmon hatchery, applied with the Oregon Water Resources Department to {{permanently}} trade their water rights to Nestlé; an action which {{does not require a}} public-interest review. Nestlé approached them in 2008 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> considering to trade their well water with Oregon's Oxbow Springs water, a publicly owned water source in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and to sell the spring water at over 100 million gallons of water per year to Nestlé. The plan has been criticized by legislators and 80,000 citizens. The 250,000-square-foot, $50 million Nestlé bottling plant in Cascade Locks with an unemployment rate of 18.8 percent would have 50 employees and would increase property-tax collections by 67 percent. The Oregon Water Resources Department was expected to issue a proposal in 2015, that would allow Nestlé to utilise spring water for its bottling operation.|$|E

25|$|On 5 March, about 7000-8000 people {{broke into}} the Dimapur Central Jail. They dragged the accused out, while parading him naked, pelted him with stones and beat him. They dragged the accused to a clock tower about 7km away, by tying a rope to his waist from a motorcycle. The accused died on the way. The body was {{displayed}} from the clock tower's railings, until the police came and took it down. The Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir later said that the mob was led {{by a group of}} a few hundred school and college girls in uniforms, which prevented the police from using more force. Jamir said that the initial crowd was small <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> repelled by baton charges. But, later the mob returned with larger numbers. Even though 8 companies of security forces were present at the jail, they failed to stop the mob. The police later said that there was at least one former inmate of the prison, who knew the interior layout of the jail.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{opinions}} in the Midrash {{as to how}} old Rebekah {{was at the time}} of her marriage and, consequently, at the twins' birth. According to the traditional counting cited by Rashi, Isaac was 37 years old at the time of the Binding of Isaac, and news of Rebekah's birth reached Abraham immediately after that event. In that case, since Isaac was 60 when Jacob and Essau were born <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> married for 20 years, then Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah (Gen. 25:20), making Rebekah 3 years old {{at the time of her}} marriage, and 23 years old at the birth of Jacob and Essau. According to the second opinion, Rebekah was 14 years old at the time of their marriage, and 34 years old at the birth of Jacob and Essau. In either case, Isaac and Rebekah were married for 20 years before Jacob and Esau were born. The Midrash says that during Rebekah's pregnancy whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out.|$|E

500|$|Many Native Americans were {{offended}} that Geronimo, {{the renowned}} 19th-century Apache leader, was irrevocably linked with bin Laden. The {{chairman of the}} Fort Sill Apache Tribe, the successor to Geronimo's tribe, {{wrote a letter to}} Obama asking him to [...] "right this wrong." [...] The president of the Navajo Nation requested that the U.S. government change the code name retroactively. Officials from the National Congress of American Indians said the focus should be on honoring the disproportionately high number of Native Americans who serve in the military, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> assured that [...] "Geronimo" [...] was not a code name for bin Laden. The U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs heard testimony on the issue from tribal leaders, while the Defense Department had no comment except to say that no disrespect was intended.|$|E
500|$|The battalion's new commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ayres, was {{apparently}} given faulty intelligence, {{and he told}} his command that the Koreans advancing south were poorly trained and poorly equipped. The battalion formed a line [...] north of Pyongtaek, {{in a series of}} grassy hills and rice paddies where it dug in and prepared for advancing North Korean forces. The soldiers of the battalion were equipped with only M1 Garand rifles or other weapons, C-rations, and less than 100 rounds of ammunition each, whilst only one M2 Browning machine gun was available to each platoon. There were no grenades and little to no ammunition for any of the heavier weapons which could be used against North Korean tanks. Additionally, {{only a few of the}} soldiers of the regiment had any combat experience from World War II, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hastily transferred from another division the day before.|$|E

500|$|Conein {{knew that}} if he saw the {{execution}} wounds, {{he would not be able}} to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in Time read [...] "'Suicide' with no hands." ...|$|E
