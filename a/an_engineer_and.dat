5|$|At 16 Higginbotham {{enrolled}} in Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Indiana. He chose Purdue because it admitted black students; was cheaper, at that time, than Rutgers University; and offered tuition discounts for good academic performance. Higginbotham was {{also interested in}} Purdue {{because he wanted to}} be <b>an</b> <b>engineer,</b> <b>and</b> Purdue was known as an engineering school.|$|E

5|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the Walt Disney World Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day.

5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

His father was <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> his mother a {{historical}} archivist. As a child he developed an early interest in math and technology. He spent his free time reading math books and won second place in a math competition at age 14. When he was fourteen, Kaspersky began attending A.N. Kolmogorov boarding school, which is run by Moscow University and specializes in math. He was {{also a member of}} the youth division of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Peter Taylor {{was born}} on 2 July 1928, one of eight {{children}} {{brought up in the}} Meadows, Nottingham, to Tom and Jenny Taylor, <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> housewife respectively.

5|$|The {{report was}} written and re-written several times. Wetzler {{wrote the first}} part, Vrba the third, and the two wrote the second part together. They then worked on the whole thing together, re-writing it six times. Neumann's aide, Oscar Krasniansky, <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> stenographer who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel, {{translated}} it from Slovak into German {{with the help of}} Gisela Steiner. They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944. Vrba wrote that the report was also translated into Hungarian. The original Slovak version was not preserved.|$|E
5|$|Gollob {{was born}} on 16 June 1912 in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. His father, Heinrich Gollob, worked as an {{academic}} painter. His mother, Johanna (née Reininghaus), {{was the daughter of}} Zoe von Karajan, a distant relative of Herbert von Karajan and wife of Carl Reininghaus. Gollob was the first of five children. Both his parents had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where they mutually befriended Gordon Mallet McCouch, an American artist of Scottish descent. McCouch was his godfather and the namesake for his first and middle names, Gordon Mac. In his youth, Gollob already wanted to become <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> pilot. In 1930, as a student at an Oberrealschule, a secondary school, he built his first primary glider in Tirol, experimenting with it at the old airfield at Innsbruck. He also completed his A- and B-license to fly glider aircraft and became an instructor as well as a construction and airframe inspector.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, {{predecessor}} of the Portland Water Bureau, began {{a search}} for a superior drinking water source. The committee, led by Henry Failing, commissioned Isaac W. Smith, <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose the Bull Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system could deliver clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison signed a proclamation creating a protected area, the Bull Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a diversion dam on the Bull Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At {{about the same time as}} the Smith survey, a small farming community, at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like Gresham and Sandy. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as <b>an</b> <b>engineer,</b> <b>and</b> she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, <b>an</b> <b>engineer</b> <b>and</b> two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
