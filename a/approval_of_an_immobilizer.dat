50|$|An Immobilizer {{can never}} be {{captured}} by <b>an</b> <b>Immobilizer,</b> or Imitator (Chameleon). An Immobilizer {{can never be}} captured by a king or Withdrawer unless the variation popular in Cambridge is being played, {{in which case the}} Immobilizer itself must first be immobilized. When <b>an</b> <b>Immobilizer</b> comes into contact with an enemy Chameleon or Immobilizer, the two pieces freeze each other, after which neither can move unless the other is captured. In the version played at Cambridge, the power <b>of</b> <b>an</b> enemy <b>Immobilizer</b> to arrest <b>a</b> friendly piece's movement is defeated when another friendly Immobilizer or Chameleon is brought up to it, effectively cancelling out each other's power to arrest movement.|$|R
