But, like most boys, he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of dances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale, Williams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who was quite as famous to her own generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty Cobb; <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> was Marjorie Harvey, who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cart-wheels in succession during the last pump-and-slipper dance at New Haven." ...|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{decided to}} change the book's setting from London to Chicago because they were more {{familiar}} with the city and it also had a [...] "great alternative music scene", according to Pink. Cusack said, [...] "When I read the book I knew where everything was in Chicago. I knew where the American Rob went to school and dropped out, where he used to spin records. I knew two or three different record shops when I was growing up that had a Rob, a Dick and a Barry in them". Charlotte Tudor, of the film's distributor, Buena Vista, said: [...] "Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> is the climate. But everyone, including Nick, felt that geography was not the central issue. It has a universal appeal". Scenes were filmed in the neighborhood of Wicker Park, [...] and on the campus of Lane Tech High School.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{ended the}} life of Johan de Witt, who had in effect ruled the Republic for almost twenty years. His regime outlasted him only a few more days. Though no more people were killed, the lynching of De Witts lent renewed impetus to the mob attacks, and to help restore public order the States of Holland {{empowered}} William on August 27 [...] to purge the city councils in any way he would see fit to restore public order. The following purges {{in the early days}} of September were accompanied by large, but peaceful, Orangist demonstrations, that had a remarkable political character. The demonstrations delivered petitions that demanded certain additional reforms with a, in a sense, [...] "reactionary" [...] flavor: the [...] "ancient" [...] privileges of the guilds and civic militias (who were traditionally seen as mouthpieces of the citizenry as a whole) to curb the regent's powers were to be recognized again (as in pre-Burgundian times). The demonstrators also demanded more influence of the Calvinist preachers on the content of government policies and a roll-back of the toleration of Catholics and other dissenting denominations. The purges of the city governments were not everywhere equally thoroughgoing (<b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> was little mention of popular influence later on, as the new regents shared the abhorrence of the old ones of real democratic reforms). But as a whole, the new Orangist regime of the Stadtholder was well-entrenched during his following reign.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, {{written with}} help from ghostwriter Mickey Herskowitz, Rather wrote {{that he was in}} Dallas to return film from an {{interview}} that morning in Uvalde at the ranch of former Vice President John Nance Garner who actually celebrated his 95th (Rather erroneously called it his 98th) birthday on November 22. Although hired in August to set up a southern bureau for CBS in New Orleans, Rather had only recently moved from Dallas to New Orleans in November [...] and would not have been in Dallas except for the need to get film to Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now KDFW) to feed to New York. Although he had no assigned reporting role in Dallas, Rather says he happened to be [...] "on {{the other side of the}} railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories." [...] His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness or hear the shooting, he said. He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly above the din, I heard one shout, 'DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.' <b>And</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> was nothing but panic wherever you looked." ...|$|E

5000|$|More recent {{critics have}} also praised the film. In 2001, Robert Weston wrote, [...] "Niagara {{is a good}} movie for noir fans who crave {{something}} a little different.
