5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers <b>are</b> <b>another</b> group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E

5|$|Dental {{sealants}} <b>are</b> <b>another</b> {{preventive therapy}} {{often used to}} provide a barrier to bacteria and decay {{on the surface of}} teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E
5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as both have prickly foliage and domed flowerheads. However, the former grows on deep sand {{while the latter}} grows on grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of B. ilicifolia compared with the loose ones of B. sessilis <b>are</b> <b>another</b> distinguishing feature.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the tracheobronchial tree {{within the}} chest may occur due to {{penetrating}} forces such as gunshot wounds, but {{are more often}} the result of blunt trauma. TBI due blunt forces usually results from high-energy impacts such as falls from height and motor vehicle accidents; the injury is rare in low-impact mechanisms. Injuries of the trachea cause about 1% of traffic-related deaths. Other potential causes are falls from high places and injuries in which the chest is crushed. Explosions <b>are</b> <b>another</b> cause.|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} the {{mechanic}} forces <b>is</b> <b>another</b> example. What we gain in power is lost in time; and the converse. The periodic or compensating errors of the planets <b>is</b> <b>another</b> instance. The influences of climate and soil in political history <b>is</b> <b>another.</b> The cold climate invigorates. The barren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers, or scorpions.|$|R
50|$|Circle {{inversion}} {{transforms the}} plane {{in a way that}} maps circles into circles, and pencils of circles into pencils of circles. The type of the pencil is preserved: the inversion of an elliptic pencil <b>is</b> <b>another</b> elliptic pencil, the inversion of a hyperbolic pencil <b>is</b> <b>another</b> hyperbolic pencil, and the inversion of a parabolic pencil <b>is</b> <b>another</b> parabolic pencil.|$|R

5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids <b>are</b> <b>another</b> group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Liver cells <b>are</b> <b>another</b> {{example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain {{an abundance of}} smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
5|$|Other {{projects}} {{that have not}} begun construction <b>are</b> <b>another</b> Early Childhood/Pre-K Childhood center, classroom and gymnasium additions, and a Student Services Center Parking Lot. The district also plans many general updates to all campuses such as school entry improvements, a digital radio communication center, and site improvements. There will also be technology additions (such as 1:1 computers at newly built Klein Cain High School in 2017) and multiple facility capital projects. High School Career and Technology Education programs, music instruments, furniture, and buses are also receiving funding in the 2015 bond.|$|E

5|$|Rising {{sea levels}} caused by global warming <b>are</b> <b>another</b> {{threat to the}} future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have {{steadily}} risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion of the Everglades. Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and Alligator Alley with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E
5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris <b>are</b> <b>another</b> major source of information. Some of these texts are found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E
5|$|Shrimp, {{chicken and}} lemon-filled briouats <b>are</b> <b>another</b> {{traditional}} specialty of Marrakesh. Rice is cooked with saffron, raisins, spices, and almonds, while couscous may have added vegetables. A pastilla is a filo-wrapped pie stuffed with minced chicken or pigeon {{that has been}} prepared with almonds, cinnamon, spices and sugar. Harira soup in Marrakesh typically includes lamb with a blend of chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli, and tomato paste, seasoned with coriander, spices and parsley. Kefta (mince meat), liver in crépinette, merguez and tripe stew are commonly sold at the stalls of Jemaa el-Fnaa.|$|E

5|$|Special {{abilities}} <b>are</b> <b>another</b> {{important aspect}} of Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 hosts {{domestic}} and regional services for Qantas Group airlines, Qantas and QantasLink (which is located {{to the northern}} end of the building). Departures are located on the first floor, while arrivals are located on the ground floor. The terminal has 16 parking bays served by aerobridges; 12 are served by single aerobridges whilst four are served by double aerobridges. There <b>are</b> <b>another</b> five non-aerobridge gates, which are used by QantasLink.|$|E
5|$|Terrestrial weather occurs almost {{exclusively}} in {{the lower part of}} the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents <b>are</b> <b>another</b> important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.|$|E

Besides five official sizes for flying on flagpoles, there <b>are</b> <b>another</b> four smaller sizes for other purpose, such as decoration on cars or display in the meeting room.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} measures 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There <b>are</b> <b>another</b> eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.|$|E

There are many chat channels, including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of English haiku. Most of the chat channels are moderated; those who violate the chat rules are banned. Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in-game, and the official Kingdom of Loathing forums <b>are</b> <b>another</b> active venue for discussion among players.|$|E
