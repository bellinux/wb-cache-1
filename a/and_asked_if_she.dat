While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would ever {{get the chance to}} work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Home and Away {{producers}} {{introduced a}} storyline that saw Charlie begin {{a relationship with}} another woman. Producers hoped the plot would boost the shows ratings. Over five weeks, the storyline would see Charlie realise that her friendship with Joey Collins (played by Kate Bell) is beginning to develop into something else. As they fall for each other, Charlie and Joey share intimate kissing and dance scenes. Anderson explained that the producers came to her about the storyline <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was okay with it, {{as it was to}} be emotional and it required commitment. Anderson told them that she was okay with it and she said she was pleased to be given the storyline as it showed more of Charlie's vulnerable side. This was Anderson's first big storyline in the show and she was required to work more hours. Anderson explained that she and Bell formed a trust early on, which helped them to portray the story in the right light. Anderson spoke with gay friends, so she could form an accurate portrayal of her character's feelings. The storyline [...] "throws [...] world upside down" [...] and changes her whole identity; it surprises her.|$|E

500|$|In {{regards to}} the miniseries' cynosural song [...] "Everything Stays", Nyström {{revealed}} that, during the storyboarding of the episode of the same name, she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother. She relayed her issue to Muto, who contacted Sugar <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{would be willing to}} pen the song. Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident in which she lost a stuffed animal in a garden. A year later, she found it; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces, but the underside was still the same. She explained, [...] " [...] wasn’t better, or worse, just different. It was the first time I realized that things will change no matter what, even if they’re left alone, and stay completely still." [...] Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show, and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic-Con International panel that [...] "because [...] was a Marceline miniseries, it wouldn't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con, Sugar and Olson performed the song live.|$|E
500|$|Suspicious of the {{identity}} of the unknown woman based on the carpoolers' general description, Walter Jones called Sharon Kinne <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had seen or spoken to his wife. Kinne allowed that she had, indeed, seen Patricia that day; she had met her to tell her about Walter's affair. According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where she dropped her off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford. [...] Based on Kinne's admission over the phone, Walter Jones met with her late Friday evening and insisted she give him more details about where his wife was; he later admitted to {{going so far as to}} hold a key to her throat threateningly. Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence. According to Boldizs, he had been the one to suggest searching the area in which they encountered the body; it was a spot to which they had often gone on dates before.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E

500|$|Franks {{said that}} after her stint in 2008, many people {{recognised}} her in the street <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would return. Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal {{the nature of the}} episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing." [...] Finally, [...] "It was a bit much. I've found EastEnders distressing over the last month." [...] The Daily Record described the scenes as 'disturbing'.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Chen {{attended}} {{a concert in}} Taipei by the American Youth Orchestra, a touring ensemble of Boston's New England Conservatory. Following the performance, Chen's accompanist escorted her backstage, introduced her to the conductor, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could play for him. Chen's opportunity came {{the next morning when}} she played for conductor Benjamin Zander in a closed basement hotel bar and was offered a scholarship immediately. She performed with the American Youth Orchestra before being invited to attend the Walnut Hill School, a preparatory school linked to the New England Conservatory, two months later at age sixteen.

The composer's work ended up having mostly string instruments – including a viola [...] played by Pook herself – with no brass or woodwinds as Pook [...] "just couldn't justify these other textures", particularly as she wanted the tracks played on dialogue-heavy scenes to be [...] "subliminal" [...] and felt such instruments would be intrusive.|$|E
