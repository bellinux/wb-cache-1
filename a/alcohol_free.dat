He made his TV debut on the July 4 ECW on Sci Fi, cutting a brief pre-taped promo about his straight edge lifestyle emphasizing the disciplinary aspects of being drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>free.</b> Although he had retained the straight edge gimmick, he now had a Muay Thai training background. Punk made his TV wrestling debut on August 1 at the Hammerstein Ballroom, defeating Justin Credible. Punk established himself in ECW by going undefeated, defeating opponents such as Christopher W.

25|$|In 2005, the {{fraternity}} issued a progress report. Significant improvements {{have occurred in}} many areas of fraternity life and operations. Since the implementation of the <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> housing policy, the all undergraduate grade point average rose from 2.77 in 2000 to nearly 3.00 in 2005. The insurance premiums of individual members have also gone down as risk management violations have decreased. Perhaps the most telling area is in membership, where Phi Delta Theta showed an increase of new members. In 2004, Phi Delta Theta had 3,102 new members while other fraternities averaged 2,415. In 1990, chapters of Phi Delta Theta were 18% larger than the typical fraternity chapter. In 2004, they were 30% larger. Also, in 2004, Phi Delta Theta was one of only 13 national/international fraternities to show an increase in total undergraduates from the previous year with an increase of 4.2%. The significance of this is highlighted by the fact that Phi Delta Theta had fewer chapters than other fraternities. Competitively, Phi Delta Theta has remained a constant among others. In terms of new members, it ranked ninth in 1990, eighth in 2000, and ninth in 2004. Many alumni members have credited the <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> housing policy in continuing this trend.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} has {{the propensity}} {{to result in}} brain damage faster {{as well as more}} severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism), due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. During the repeated <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> stages associated with binge drinking, a larger amount of glutamate is released than occurs during withdrawal from chronic alcohol abuse; additionally this extreme release of glutamate happens on a repeated basis in binge drinkers leading to excitotoxicity. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking, which induced immediate and repeated insults to the brain.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} leadership change {{occurred in}} the beginning of the 1990s when Robert Biggs became the fourth executive vice president of the fraternity after Robert Miller stepped down. During the decade, Phi Delta Theta and many other fraternities experienced a decline in membership. The most important policy to be implemented by the fraternity during the decade was the decision made in 1997 to have all chapter facilities <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> by 2000. It was an initiative that was strongly pursued by the 1996–98 General Council. The policy was in response to the growing insurance claims against the fraternity, 53% of which were alcohol-related, and a return to the core values of the organization.|$|E

As a tribute to retiring star Darrell Waltrip, the entire Turn 3 and 4 sections were renamed in his honor in 2000, including a section of seats in Turn 4 near the start-finish line marked as <b>alcohol</b> <b>free.</b> (Waltrip refused to drive for a team in 1987 because its sponsor was associated with alcoholic beverages.) Sections were also named in honor of the Allison family and David Pearson as part of the renaming of grandstands.|$|E
25|$|When Phi Delta Theta {{announced}} {{the inception of}} an <b>alcohol</b> <b>free</b> housing policy, the announcement was met both by hope and skepticism. While some saw the banning of alcohol in housing facilities as a welcome return to the principles on which the fraternity was founded, others felt the drastic cultural shift would hurt social dynamics. The General Council and GHQ had expected resistance from both alumni and undergraduate members {{when it was first}} proposed. Among the most vocal chapters against the policy were the University of Virginia chapter, where a faction split off from Phi Delta Theta and chose to form a separate local fraternity known as the Phi Society, and the University of the South chapter, which formed the Phi Society of 1883 rather than adopt the policy. Phi Delta Theta returned to the University of Virginia one year later and formed a new chapter. Phi Delta Theta has not returned to the University of the South.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in intestinal mucosal cell uptake rate {{can be achieved by}} making brush border enzyme-labile derivatives of water insoluble compounds. The test compounds chosen were decanol, hexadecanol, their corresponding lysinate esters, hydrocortisone and its phosphate and succinate esters. Intestinal perfusion and intestinal ring uptake experiments in the alcohol study demonstrated that prodrug uptake was comparable to uptake of the <b>free</b> <b>alcohol</b> below the solubility of the parent compound; i. e., there was little or no loss in intestinal permeability. Prodrug uptake continued to increase linearly above the solubility of the <b>free</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the ring system. Similar results were obtained for hydrocortisone and its prodrugs when uptake was examined in the intestinal ring system; furthermore, rapid post-incubation freezing of the tissue coupled with an HPLC assay capable of separating drug from prodrug permitted determination of the species absorbed. In all cases, only <b>free</b> <b>alcohol</b> was detected in the tissue. Histological studies verified the integrity of intestinal tissue under experimental conditions. The in vitro ittechnique is advantageous for screening drug absorption. The very substantial potential of this prodrug approach is demonstrated in particular with hexadecanol and hexadecyl lysinate, where the uptake rate of the prodrug was four orders of magnitude greater than that of the <b>free</b> <b>alcohol...</b>|$|R

40|$|The fate of {{lipophilic}} extractives {{from several}} nonwoody species (flax, hemp, sisal and abaca) {{used for the}} manufacturing of cellulose pulps, was studied during soda/anthraquinone (AQ) pulping and totally chorine free (TCF) and elemental chlorine free (ECF) bleaching. With this purpose, the lipophilic extracts from the raw materials and their unbleached and bleached industrial pulps, were analyzed by gas chromatography– mass spectrometry. Aldehydes, hydroxyfatty acids and esterified compounds such as ester waxes, sterol esters and alkylferulates strongly decreased after soda/AQ pulping while alkanes, <b>alcohols,</b> <b>free</b> sterols and sterol glycosides survived the cooking process. Among the lipophilic extractives that remained in the unbleached pulps, some amounts of free sterols were still present in the TCF pulps whereas they were practically absent in the ECF pulps.
