However, American Express honored its commitments to Lady Gaga and her team, and the event was able to proceed without an official role for American Express. Lady Gaga is an incredible artist <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to work together in the future.|$|E

500|$|A {{majority}} of people polled by The New Paper felt the advertisement was disrespectful and in bad taste. MICA said that the advertisement did not breach the law as it only reproduced some components of the flag—it did not, for example, incorporate the flag's red and white background together. However, K.U. Menon, director of MICA's National Resilience Division, said: [...] "MICA does not encourage such ads which treat the national flag with disrespect. [...] Symbols should be treated with some measure of dignity <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> Loof will withdraw the ad on its own initiative." ...|$|E

[...] This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition [...] "Something", which he lauded as [...] "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". On [...] "Far East Man", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts [...] "reminiscent of the soul stylings" [...] of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the series' end in August 2010, The Bill was the United Kingdom's longest-running police drama and was among the longest-running of any British {{television}} series. The series finale, entitled [...] "Respect", was aired in two parts and was dedicated to [...] "the {{men and women of the}} Metropolitan Police Service past and present". The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith after being stabbed.

500|$|Since its release, The Blair Witch Project {{has been}} widely {{regarded}} by many as an influence to an array of subsequent films similarly using the found footage concept and the conventions the film established. These include Paranormal Activity and REC (both in 2007), Cloverfield (2008), The Last Exorcism and Trollhunter (both in 2010), Chronicle, Project X, V/H/S , and End of Watch (all in 2012), and The Den (2013). Some critics have also noted the film as being strikingly similar to Cannibal Holocaust (1980), and The Last Broadcast (1998) in terms of basic plot premise and narrative style. Although Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato has acknowledged the similarities of The Blair Witch Project to his film, he criticized the publicity that it received for being an original production; advertisements for The Blair Witch Project also promoted {{the idea that the}} footage is genuine. Despite initial reports by media outlets such as the New York Post and E! Entertainment that The Last Broadcast creators, Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler, had alleged that The Blair Witch Project was a complete rip-off of their work and would sue Haxan Films for copyright infringement, they repudiated these allegations. One of the creators told IndieWire in 1999, [...] "If somebody enjoys The Blair Witch Project there is a chance they will enjoy our film, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> they will check it out." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of season three, Chris Carabott from IGN described Ben as [...] "one of the best 'villains on television', due to his 'eerie manner' and 'methodical delivery'". Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken with a grain of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. I have no idea when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure of is that everything he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> that he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben". Martell also gave six reasons to look forward to season four, one of which was Ben Linus.|$|E
