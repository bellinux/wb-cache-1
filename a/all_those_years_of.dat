40|$|Objective Following the {{licensure}} of 23 -valent {{pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine}} (23 vPPV) in 1989, a risk-group–only immunization {{policy was}} implemented in 1992 in England. The PPV programme was extended in 2003 to include all individuals 65 years and over. In England, this was phased in over 3 years. To ascertain {{the performance of the}} risk group policy in <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age and over and provide a baseline to estimate the impact of the universal elderly programme. Methods Information was gathered on vaccine uptake for the period 1989 – 2003 in England from a national survey of general practitioners (GPs) through NHS primary care trusts (PCTs), the prescription cost analysis (PCA) system and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Results Between 1991 and 2003, 4. 5 million doses of PPV were prescribed. The GP survey found that by 2003, 29 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> and over <b>of</b> age and 36 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age over had received PPV. Sixty-two per cent of general practices had implemented a risk-group–only policy, 14. 4 % had targeted <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age over and 14. 2 % had targeted <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 75 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age over. The GPRD study found that 38 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> over and 41 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> over fell into one or more high-risk groups. By 2003, 36. 6 % of the high-risk group and 30. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> over had ever been vaccinated. Vaccine uptake increased with age, with 52. 3 % of the high-risk group and 37 % <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> over having ever been vaccinated. Conclusions A large proportion of those in risk groups remained unvaccinated with PPV in 2003. Formal evaluation of the impact and effective...|$|R

Emily had believed with all her heart in her apparent disinterestedness, and her hopes and sympathy for us were real; and so, when the crash really came, and she told the poor girl with floods of tears that it was impossible, and a thing not to be thought of, for a right-minded woman to unite herself to a man of such birth. And poor Emily, with the conscious ignorance of eighteen, believed, and was the sort of gentle creature who could easily be daunted by the terror that her generous impulses to share the shame and namelessness were unfeminine and wrong. The utter silence had been the consequence of her mother assuring her, with authority, that the true kindness was to betray no token of feeling that could cherish hope where all was hopeless, and that he would regret her less if she commanded herself and gave him no look.|$|E

60|$|Into {{all this}} Mr. Harmer entered {{with a fresh}} pleasure, and a frank joyous spirit which charmed and {{attracted}} all. With the ladies he was an especial favourite; to them his manners and address were so singularly different {{to those of the}} men with whom they were accustomed to associate, that they could not fail to be greatly impressed by it. Herbert Harmer had seen little or nothing of women, for--with the exception only of his wife, who had always been a great invalid, and whom he had nursed for years with almost devotional care and kindness--he had been thrown in contact with very few English women, and he regarded the whole sex with an almost chivalrous devotion and respect which in a man of his age was very strange and touching. Although a very well-read man--for in his distant home he had kept himself well supplied with the current English literature, and with scientific works of every description--he knew very little of real life. Of commanding intellect, had he been placed in different circumstances where his mind could have had fair scope for its exercise, Herbert Harmer would have made a conspicuous figure for himself; as it was, although all found in him a charming companion and a sympathizer in their various tastes, few would have suspected how great were the stores of knowledge which the simple-hearted childlike man had stored up in <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> solitary reading.|$|E

60|$|Tucked away in {{that little}} old dark manor house, whose stables alone were up to date--three hours from London, and some thirty miles from The Wash, it must be confessed that her {{upbringing}} lacked modernity. About twice a year, Winton took her up to town to stay with his unmarried sister Rosamund in Curzon Street. Those weeks, if they did nothing else, increased her natural taste for charming clothes, fortified her teeth, and fostered her passion for music and the theatre. But the two main nourishments of the modern girl--discussion and games--she lacked utterly. Moreover, those {{years of her life}} from fifteen to nineteen were before the social resurrection of 1906, and the world still crawled like a winter fly on a window-pane. Winton was a Tory, Aunt Rosamund a Tory, everybody round her a Tory. The only spiritual development she underwent <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> her girlhood was through her headlong love for her father. After all, was there any other way in which she could really have developed? Only love makes fruitful the soul. The sense of form that both had in such high degree prevented much demonstration; but to be with him, do things for him, to admire, and credit him with perfection; and, since she could not exactly wear the same clothes or speak in the same clipped, quiet, decisive voice, to dislike the clothes and voices of other men--all this was precious to her beyond everything. If she inherited from him that fastidious sense of form, she also inherited his capacity for putting all her eggs in one basket. And since her company alone gave him real happiness, the current of love flowed over her heart all the time. Though she never realized it, abundant love FOR somebody was as necessary to her as water running up the stems of flowers, abundant love FROM somebody as needful as sunshine on their petals. And Winton's somewhat frequent little runs to town, to Newmarket, or where not, were always marked in her by a fall of the barometer, which recovered as his return grew near.|$|E

His sister and Avis Graydon became close friends later, as they served in the same Catholic church in Leytonstone. Hitchcock exchanged Christmas cards with Avis Graydon but they never discussed the case. He asked his authorised biographer, John Russell Taylor, not to mention the case of Edith Thompson in case it caused her sister distress, even after <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years.</b> Some aspects <b>of</b> the case have similarities to the plot of Hitchcock's film Stage Fright (1950).|$|R
60|$|It is creditable to Miss Martineau's {{breadth of}} sympathy {{that she should}} have left on record the tribute of her admiration for Carlyle, for nobody has written so harshly as Carlyle on the subject which {{interested}} Harriet Martineau more passionately than any other events of her time. In 1834 she had finished her series of illustrations of political economy; her domestic life was fretted by the unreasonable exigences of her mother; London society had perhaps begun to weary her, and she felt the need of a change of scene. The United States, with the old European institutions placed amid new conditions, were then as now a natural object of interest to everybody with a keen feeling for social improvement. So to the Western Republic Miss Martineau turned her face. She had not been long in the States before she began to feel that the Abolitionists, at that moment a despised and persecuted handful of men and women, were the truly moral and regenerating party in the country. Harriet Martineau no sooner felt this conviction driving out her former prejudice against them as fanatical and impracticable, than she at once bore public testimony, at serious risk of every kind to herself, in favour of the extreme Anti-Slavery agitators. And for thirty years she never slackened her sympathy nor her energetic action on English public opinion, in this most vital matter of her time. She was guided not merely by humanitarian disgust at the cruel and brutal abominations of slavery,--though we know no reason why this alone should not be a sufficient ground for turning Abolitionist,--but also on the more purely political ground of the cowardice, silence, corruption, and hypocrisy that were engendered in the Free States by purchased connivance at the peculiar institution of the Slave States. Nobody has yet traced out the full effect upon the national character of the Americans of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> conscious complicity in slavery, after the moral iniquity of slavery had become clear to the inner conscience of the very men who ignobly sanctioned the mobbing of Abolitionists.|$|E

The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique. Even The New York Dramatic Mirror gave some praise to the production, but noted that the acting of the mother's friend was the weakest because [...] " [...] man of his [...] wouldn't have backed off so quickly."
