25|$|The Shetland Sheepdog, {{also known}} as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog. The {{original}} name of this breed was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy among the Rough Collie breeders at the time, so the breed's name was formally changed to Shetland Sheepdog. This small dog is intelligent, vocal, excitable, energetic and willing to please <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard.</b> The breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Florence Hawley (September 17, 1906-1991) {{was one of}} {{the first}} anthropologists to work {{extensively}} on dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating. She conducted archaeological and ethnographic research in the Southwestern United States; and undertook some of the first dendrochronological research in eastern North America in the mid 20th century, examining samples from a number of archaeological sites. She was also highly regarded as a passionate teacher who pushed her students toward greatness by encouraging them to think for themselves <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> for what they wanted to achieve. Although faced with many challenges in her career, and discriminated against for being a woman, she persevered in her research and became a great influence both for her students and for other women in her field.|$|E

The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E

500|$|The other protagonist, Aoba is {{the third}} {{daughter}} of the Tsukishima family, one year younger than Ko and Wakaba. Aoba {{is seen as a}} tomboy by other characters, one who loves baseball very much. Her father has played catch with Aoba since she was little, thus grooming her into a strong pitcher. She has a poster of Ryota Igarashi, a famous fastball pitcher, on her bedroom wall, and when she was young Aoba told Wakaba she was only interested in a guy who could pitch a fastball over [...] She has an excellent pitching form, on which Ko based his own form, and she has a wide variety of pitches. Although as a girl she cannot play in official inter-school games, in practice games she plays center field or replaces Ko as pitcher. Many younger members of the Seishu baseball team are inspired by how much effort she puts into baseball and coaching them, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to not disappoint her. Ko claims she is secretly disappointed that she {{will never be able to}} pitch in an official game, and Yuhei Azuma points out that she is using Ko as her proxy to get to Koshien.|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{used the}} {{time to prepare for}} the {{following}} series in South Africa, even took up yoga in attempt to bolster his performances abroad. In December 2004, he made 85 not out against an N.F. Oppenheimer XI in South Africa. A partnership of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was followed by a partnership of 273 in the second, in which they both scored over 130. This was a record opening partnership at Durban and England's first 200 opening stand since Gooch and Mike Atherton in 1991. Before this, the difference between his home and abroad average was over 20, and his third overseas century went a long way to counter this. With regard to his touring difficulties, Trescothick stated [...] "I wouldn't say I've put it to rest, but I've made a big step forward to putting it to rest. It's a mental battle for me, something I have to deal with <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to try to understand what is different. He made a further improvement with an even larger score of 180, as England won the fourth Test. After batting slowly with Ashley Giles, the fall of Hoggard's wicket soon afterwards spurred Trescothick to start [...] "unleashing ferocious shots", setting up an unlikely victory with Steve Harmison partnering him. In the matches preceding the 2005 Ashes series, England wrapped up two easy victories against Bangladesh. Trescothick scored 194 in the first Test, and 151 in the second. He also scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI, surpassing Gooch's record of eight ODI centuries for England.|$|E

2500|$|A new law on press freedom, drafted {{with help}} from {{international}} NGOs on August 28, 1998 and enacted on January 1, 1999, {{paved the way for}} media reforms. [...] The Mongolian media currently consists of around 300 print and broadcasting outlets. The press, in all forms, carries criticism of the government and [...] "heavy-handed" [...] police tactics during demonstrations, though journalists remain at risk of laws criminalising defamation and reporting on [...] "state secrets". Despite laws against censorship, a small number of outlets were censored that reported on corruption of government officials, which have often led the opposition to accuse the governing Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party of using the media to ensure its success in elections. The government encourages press freedom; head of government Miyegombo Enkhbold spoke of “journalists who fight social injustice <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> to develop a free press”. To avoid libel offenses, the independent media undergo a degree of self-censorship. Globe International, an independent media watchdog, was set up in 1999 in the capital which aims to protect media freedom and expression.|$|E
2500|$|Cultural {{determinism}} believes {{culture is}} the driving force for different levels of economic growth. For example, Max Weber believes that Protestant ethic explains the industrial revolution and economic boom in Western Europe. Different from previous Christian beliefs, Protestantism attributes the [...] "good life" [...] to one's faith in God and God's reciprocal blessing. This belief motivates people to work hard and collectively contribute to economic growth. On the other side, some people claim that African, Asian and Native American cultures do not promote values that motivate people to innovate <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> and thus those civilizations lagged behind. However, this theory is incapable of explaining the recent economic miracle in Asia. Although Confucianism is believed to create social hierarchy and nepotism, in reality it translated into high work ethics in countries and regions that now contribute to the economic boom in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as the recent rapid economic growth in China. Moreover, it is unable to explain the differences in economic growth between two places that share similar or even the same culture, such as between North Korea and South Korea, where the culture was essentially homogeneous until the Korean War. Acemoglu and Robinson also believe that culture to some extent is shaped by the political institutions. For example, the hardworking culture in Confucian societies like South Korea and China is shaped by the incentive structure of the state. Therefore, culture is an effect, not a cause.|$|E

[...] The state-owned China Central Television (CCTV) reported that the test was [...] "a historic moment for India, and it shows that India has joined the club of the countries that own ballistic missiles." [...] However, CCTV listed some of the missile's shortcomings and reported that [...] "it does not pose a threat in reality." [...] More negative commentary can be found in Global Times, a state-run tabloid, which reported that India [...] "still lags behind in infrastructure construction, but its society is highly supportive of developing nuclear power and the West chooses to overlook India's disregard of nuclear and missile control treaties" [...] and warned India not to [...] "over-estimate its strength". Subsequently, they also claimed that although India may have missiles that can reach all parts of China, India stands [...] "no chance in an overall arms race" [...] with the country. Chinese experts say that the missile actually has the potential to reach targets [...] away and that the Indian government had [...] "deliberately downplayed the missile's capability in order to avoid causing concern to other countries".|$|E
