In design of <b>Axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> the work presented comprises of basic flow parameters and dimensions of parts, this makes the further design process quite simple and the results will be helpful to take further changes or improvement at the time of detailed design. The objective of work presented is to design <b>Axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> by using mean line method for a given mass flow rate and required pressure ratio.

The same parameters are also determined for all five stages.

By upgrading the required instrumentation on a gas turbine and an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor,</b> and indepth performance simulation and evaluation {{can be made}} {{in order to determine the}} overall thermodynamic performance and mechanical deterioration of the train. With the proper instrumentation, critical parameters in the gas turbine such as component efficiencies, power, head, turbine firing temperature, heat rate, and heat balance can be computed. On the <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor,</b> section efficiencies, head, power, flow, and head coefficients can be computed. By understanding all the performance parameters and obtaining a good running history on these parameters, one can easily determine the condition of the rotating equipment at any given time.

Major rotating equipment overhaul intervals can be identified by closely monitoring the performed deterioration parameters of any gas turbine or <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor.</b> This enables the unit to be operated with confidence through a planned major overhaul.

In the previous research, {{it is very difficult to}} accurately model the fouled <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor.</b> This paper develops a new performance calculation method of fouled multistage <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressor</b> based on experiment result and operating data.

In this model, the performance of the first section is obtained by combining scaling law method and linear progression model with traditional stage stacking method; simultaneously ambient conditions and engine configurations are considered. On the other hand, the performance of the second section is calculated by averaged infinitesimal stage method which is based on Reynolds’ law of similarity.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of closed-loop Brayton cycle power plants, {{such as the}} PBMR, resulted in the need to simulate start-up transients for industrial multi-stage <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressors</b> operating at subsonic conditions. This implies that the delivery pressure and power requirements must be predicted for different mass flow rates and rotational speeds while operating {{in the first and}} fourth quadrants on the compressor performance charts. Therefore, an analytical performance prediction model for subsonic multi-stage <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compressors</b> had to be developed that can be integrated into a generic network analysis software code such as Flownex.
