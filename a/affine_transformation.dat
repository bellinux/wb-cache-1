25|$|Affine {{transformations of}} the plane are useful for {{studying}} equidissections, including translations, uniform and non-uniform scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and linear maps. Since an <b>affine</b> <b>transformation</b> preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means that one is free to apply any <b>affine</b> <b>transformation</b> to a polygon that might give it a more manageable form. For example, {{it is common to}} choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0).|$|E

40|$|Curvature scale-space (CSS) corner {{detectors}} {{look for}} curvature maxima or inflection points on planar curves. They use arc-length parameterized curvature. Therefore, {{they are not}} robust to <b>affine</b> <b>transformations</b> since the arc-length of a curve is not preserved under <b>affine</b> <b>transformations.</b> However, the affine-length of a curve is relatively invariant to <b>affine</b> <b>transformations.</b> This paper presents an improved CSS corner detector by applying the affine-length parameterized curvature to the CSS corner detection technique.

25|$|An affine convex cone is the set {{resulting}} from applying an <b>affine</b> <b>transformation</b> to a convex cone. A common example is translating a convex cone by a point p: p+C. Technically, such transformations can produce non-cones. For example, unless p=0, p+C {{is not a}} linear cone. However, it is still called an affine convex cone.|$|E
25|$|Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is {{a method}} that allows one to measure brain tissue {{composition}} differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an <b>affine</b> <b>transformation</b> that minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of grey or white matter in a voxel can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.|$|E
25|$|Under {{repeated}} iteration of the horseshoe map, most orbits {{end up at}} {{the fixed}} point in the left cap. This is because the horseshoe maps the left cap into itself by an <b>affine</b> <b>transformation</b> that has exactly one fixed point. Any orbit that lands on the left cap never leaves it and converges to the fixed point in the left cap under iteration. Points in the right cap get mapped into the left cap on the next iteration, and most points in the square get mapped into the caps. Under iteration, most points will be part of orbits that converge to the fixed point in the left cap, but some points of the square never leave.|$|E
