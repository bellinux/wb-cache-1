40|$|Among {{specific}} amyloid ligands, Congo red and its analogues {{are often}} considered potential therapeutic compounds. However, {{the results of}} the studies so far have not been univocal because the properties of this dye, derived mostly from its supramolecular nature, are still poorly understood. The supramolecular structure of Congo red, formed by π–π stacking of dye molecules, is susceptible to the influence of the electric field, which may significantly facilitate electron delocalization. Consequently, the electric field may generate altered physico-chemical properties of the dye. Enhanced electron delocalization, induced by the electric field, alters the total charge of Congo red, making the dye more acidic (negatively charged). This is a consequence of withdrawing electrons from polar substituents of aromatic rings—sulfonic and amino groups—thus increasing their tendency to dissociate protons. The electric field-induced <b>charge</b> <b>alteration</b> observed in electrophoresis depends on dye concentration. This concentration-dependent <b>charge</b> <b>alteration</b> effect disappears when the supramolecular structure disintegrates in DMSO.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of graphene prepared by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) are not easily comparable to the {{properties of}} nearly perfect graphene prepared by mechanical cleavage. In this work, we attempt to investigate the mechanical performance of CVD graphene (simply supported or embedded in polymer matrix), transferred by two different techniques, under uniaxial loading with simultaneous in-situ monitoring by Raman microspectroscopy. The level of charge transfer doping and strain is assessed using the vector analysis modified for uniaxial strain. The strain distribution across the samples varies significantly, owing to the growth and transfer process, which induces wrinkles and faults in the CVD graphene. In simply supported specimens, the stress transfer efficiency is generally very low and the changes in Raman spectra are dominated by variations in the charge transfer originating from the realignment of the domains on the substrate upon the application of strain. In contrast, samples covered with an additional polymer layer exhibit an improved stress transfer efficiency, and the <b>alterations</b> of <b>charge</b> doping levels are negligible.

The molecules formed are labile and undergo <b>alterations</b> in <b>charge</b> properties, which rapidly lead to heterogeneity of the myeloma protein after synthesis. The single immunoglobulin species originally formed is found {{only after the}} shortest time-intervals tested, i. e. 10 min incubation. Two types of changes in charge properties take place: (1) The originally formed protein (component o) is converted via an intermediate o′ into the most basic form of 5563 myeloma protein found in serum (component a). Charge differences between these components are suppressed at pH 8. 9, but can be studied by chromatography at pH 6. 5 or by analysis of isoelectric points by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel. The conversion of components o and o′ into component a apparently commences soon after assembly of the molecules and proceeds to completion extracellularly. (2) The second type of charge difference that distinguishes components a, b, c and d is exhibited over the pH range 6. 0 – 8. 9, but not at acid pH, and has been studied by electrophoresis at pH 8. 9, by chromatography and by isoelectric focusing. Conversion of component a into components b, c, d and e is only partial so that all five components {{can be found at}} decreasing concentrations in serum. Both types of <b>charge</b> <b>alteration</b> can be effected in vitro in the presence of serum, with optimum pH 8. 0. None of the charge differences could be attributed to the secretion process, since a component with the same isoelectric point as component o was found in secreted myeloma protein (1 h).

40|$|Each day 180 {{liters of}} plasma is {{filtered}} in the kidneys. Under normal conditions, the glomerular barrier restricts {{the passage of}} macromolecules such as albumin while it is highly permeable to water and small solutes. Proteinuria is a hallmark of renal disease and reflects impairment of the glomerular barrier. The glomerular barrier has size and charge selective properties and consists of the fenestrated endothelium covered with a glycocalyx, the glomerular basement membrane, and the podocytes. In this thesis, the somewhat controversial issue of involvement of the endothelial cell glycocalyx in glomerular charge selectivity is investigated. The glomerular barrier has been studied with respect to function, morphology and gene expression in healthy, enzyme treated, and diabetic kidneys. Experiments were performed using the isolated perfused kidneys at 8 C in order to investigate the glomerular barrier without the tubular modifications of primary urine that occurs in vivo. Kidneys in which the endothelial cell glycocalyx was altered with glucose/galactoseaminoglycan (GAG) degrading enzymes showed an up to 5 -fold increase in fractional clearance for albumin. This is due to an <b>alteration</b> in glomerular <b>charge</b> selectivity since the fractional clearance for Ficoll 35. 5 Å, the neutral counterpart of albumin, was unaltered. The enzyme action on the glycocalyx was confirmed morphologically in electron microscopy where Intralipid® droplets were used as indirect markers of the glycocalyx. To clarify if long term diabetes alters glomerular size or charge selectivity or both, we studied non obese diabetic mice for 10 and 40 weeks. Diabetes for 40 weeks resulted in altered glomerular charge selectivity as shown by a 3 -fold increase in the fractional clearance for albumin, without any change of the neutral counterpart Ficoll 35. 5 Å. Real-time PCR with the low density arrays revealed a down-regulation of cortex mRNA expression for versican, decorin, biglycan, matrix metalloprotease- 9, and podocin after 40 weeks of diabetes. In summary, this thesis describes {{the importance of the}} glomerular endothelial cell glycocalyx in charge selectivity.
