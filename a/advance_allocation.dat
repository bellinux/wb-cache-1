40|$|Abstract—A novel dynamic {{power and}} bit {{allocation}} scheme for spectral efficiency maximization in the Cognitive Ultra Wideband radio system {{is presented in}} this paper. A new bit error rate expression is derived based on approximating a sum of independent log-normal random variables as a single log-normal random variable using the Fenton-Wilkinson method in order to analyze the spectral efficiency in the UWB multipath channel. A series of M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation zones can be generated over each UWB subcarrier by manipulating the BER expression. The total transmitted power is optimally distributed among the UWB subcarriers {{for the use of}} those zones with a maximum M on each subcarrier. The power and bit allocation is divided into primary <b>allocation</b> and <b>advanced</b> <b>allocation</b> for efficient implementation.

40|$|UltraWideband is a high-speed, {{short-range}} and low-power wireless technology. UWB {{system is}} overlapped with wireless {{systems such as}} WLAN, WiMax and UMTS, which limits the use of UWB. Cognitive radio technology enables the UWB system to efficiently use the overlapped spectrum without causing interference to other wireless systems. The thesis focuses {{on the design of}} the cognitive radio resource allocation algorithms for spectrum efficiency maximization in the multiband OFDM UWB system. The spectrum efficiency of a cognitive UWB system depends on the cognitive algorithms used in spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing and spectrum management. The spectrum efficiency maximization problem is formulated to a multi-dimensional knapsack problem with constraints in the transmit power of the UWB subcarriers, the average bit error rate and the interference to the primary users. New cognitive algorithms for spectrum sensing and spectrum management are developed to solve the optimization problem. The proposed low-complexity cognitive algorithms include: primary and <b>advanced</b> power <b>allocation</b> algorithm, group power allocation algorithm and spectrum sensing time optimization algorithm. In a cognitive UWB system, the primary and <b>advanced</b> power <b>allocation</b> algorithm as well as the group power allocation algorithm are used for spectrum management, while spectrum sensing time optimization algorithm is used for spectrum sensing. The spectrum sensing time optimization algorithm computes the optimal spectrum sensing period which maximizes the cognitive UWB system’s data transmission period while guaranteeing a target probability of detection/false-alarm. During the data transmission period, the primary and <b>advanced</b> power <b>allocation</b> algorithm achieves the optimal spectrum efficiency by equally allocating the transmit power and distributing the excessively allocated power to the subcarriers in a greedy manner. Also, the group power allocation algorithm can obtain the optimal spectrum efficiency by adaptively assigning the transmit power to the subcarrier groups according to the effective signal-to-noise ratio of each subcarrier group whose bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth of the UWB channel. For energy-limited cognitive UWB system, the proposed cognitive algorithms maximize the spectrum efficiency with lower order-of-growth than the traditional dynamic radio resource allocation algorithms...|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} {{control laws}} for systems with constraints {{added to the}} tracking performance, control allocation methods can be utilized. Control allocations methods are used when there are more command inputs than controlled variables. Constraints that require allocators are such task as; surface saturation limits, structural load limits, drag reduction constraints or actuator failures. Most transport aircraft have many actuated surfaces compared to the three controlled variables (such as angle of attack, roll rate & angle of side slip). To distribute the control effort among the redundant set of actuators a fixed mixer approach can be utilized or online control allocation techniques. The benefit of an online allocator is that constraints can {{be considered in the}} design whereas the fixed mixer cannot. However, an online control allocator mixer has a disadvantage of not guaranteeing a surface schedule, which can then produce ill defined loads on the aircraft. The load uncertainty and complexity has prevented some controller designs from using <b>advanced</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques.

The system consists of one central warehouse which supplies N non-identical retailers with one single product. Customer demand occurs solely at the retailers and follows independent Poisson processes. The purpose is to investigate the value of using a more <b>advanced</b> <b>allocation</b> policy than First Come-First Serve at the central warehouse. The focus is on evaluating how well the simple First Come-First Serve assumption works in a system where the warehouse has access to real-time point-of-sale data, and where shipments are time based and consolidated for all retailers. The considered allocation policy is a myopic policy where the solution to a minimization problem, formulated as a constrained newsvendor problem, determines how the warehouse allocates its stock to the retailers. The minimization problem is solved using (a heuristic method based on) Lagrangian relaxation, and simulation is {{used to evaluate the}} average inventory holding costs and backorder costs per time unit when using the considered policy. The simulation study shows that cost savings around 1 - 4 percent can be expected for most system configurations. However, there were cases where savings were as high as 5 percent, as well as cases where the policy performed worse than First Come-First Serve. The study also shows that the highest cost savings are found in systems with relatively low demand, few retailers, short transportation times and a short time interval between shipments...|$|R

40|$|Next {{generation}} aircraft with a {{large number}} of actuators will require <b>advanced</b> control <b>allocation</b> methods to compute the actuator commands needed to follow desired trajectories while respecting system constraints. Previously, algorithms were proposed to minimize the l 1 or l 2 norms of the tracking error and of the actuator deflections.

Minimization of the control effort translates into the minimization of the maximum actuator deflection (min-max optimization). The paper shows how the problem can be solved effectively by converting it into a linear program and solving it using a simplex algorithm. Properties of the algorithm are also investigated through examples. In particular, the min-max criterion results in a type of load balancing, where the load is th desired command and the algorithm balances this load among various actuators.

This paper presents an <b>advanced</b> resource <b>allocation</b> strategy to tackle such a problem by considering the traffic pattern of individual data streams. To properly allocate resource for streaming queries execution, we define {{a certain number of}} priority channels to categorize the streaming data across the system.

The proposed solution does not depend on any assumption about the incoming data rate or the query processing time. The performance of the proposed solution is benchmarked, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme increases the overall resource utilization by 23 % on average and reduces the QoS violations by 29 % against round-robin strategy.
