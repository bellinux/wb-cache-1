5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>low</b> density, and these shales {{may not be}} chemically compatible with some drilling fluids.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an experiment}} aiming {{to investigate the}} contribution of illiquidity risk to the total risk of a risky investment project.

Results confirm the insidious nature of illiquidity: {{as long as a}} first collective default does not occur, investors accept high intrinsic risk projects. After a first default, they become extremely prudent and come back to market only gradually. After several defaults, private agents manage to coordinate on <b>an</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>low</b> intrinsic risk above which they refuse to participate in the project.
