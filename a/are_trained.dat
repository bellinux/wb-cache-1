The experimental study with 2 x 2 factorial designs was conducted at the Regional Labor Training Centre of West Jakarta with training participants of the center involved as subjects of the study. The study {{has been focused on}} four Research Questions: (1) Is there any significant difference in the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy?; (2) Is there any significant difference in the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors with high level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy?; (3) Is there any in the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors with low level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy?; and (4) Is there any interactions between the effect of training strategies and knowledge of basic concepts of ecology on the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors?Findings of the study signify that (1) there is {{no significant difference in the}} environmental-based attitude of prospective labors who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy; (2) prospective labors with high level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy show better environmental-based attitude compared to those who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy; (3) prospective labors with low level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy show better environmental-based attitude compared to those who <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy; and (4) there is an interaction between training strategies and knowledge of basic concepts of ecology on the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors. To sum up, to promote better environmental-based attitude of prospective labors requires appropriate <b>training</b> strategies that <b>is</b> determined by carefully considering their knowledge level on basic concepts of ecology...|$|R

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities.

They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E
