30|$|On {{the basis}} of fault zone {{structures}} and their control on remaining oil distribution, {{and the types of}} remaining oil, a three-step approach for predicting distribution of remaining oil at fault edges was developed. First, we should determine faults and fault blocks with rich remaining oil and optimal NNW <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> footwalls based on the matching relationship between faults and reservoirs. Second, we will determine the location of faults by superposing micro-amplitude structures, ranges of fault sealing oil, and the oblique anticlines formed by soft-linkage faults, and determining favorable locations for the distribution of remaining oil. Third, we should determine the horizon for tapping remaining oil potential in favorable settings on {{the basis of}} the injection–production relationships of all sublayers.|$|E

Based on the principle of differential fault subsidence, a preliminary method is established to predict micro-amplitude structures using a throw-distance curve.|$|R
30|$|We note two minor {{features}} in the coseismic surface ruptures along the normal fault zone. One is left-lateral slip of up to 1.2  m accompanying the normal faulting (Fig.  3 b). These left-lateral features were discernible from man-made features and by jigsaw matching and the restoration of detailed rupture shapes between the up-thrown side and down-thrown side. The other observed feature is an <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> that locally uplifts the downslope side of the main fault zone making the uphill-facing fresh scarp (Fig.  4 e). A significant antithetic (south-dipping) rupture scarp at 6.2 - to 7.3 -km mark emerged exactly along the northern foothill of tectonic geomorphic bulges (pale blue lines in Fig.  2 b). These two minor but important features enable us to prove that these 10 -km-long continuous scarps are purely tectonic, not {{a product of a}} massive landslide or a combination of local landslides.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-We {{present a}} {{detailed}} seismological {{study of the}} Kozani earthquake. We relocate the mainshock with regional data at depth of 14. 2 km beneath the Vourinos massif. We compute the focal mechanism by body waveform modeling at teleseismic distance and find a normal fault striking N 240 ” and dipping 40 ” toward the NW with a centro’id depth of 11 km. We installed a dense network of portable seismographs around the epicentral region and located several hundreds of aftershocks. The main cluster of aftershock seismicity defines a plane dipping north at an angle of about 35 ”, consistent with the main-shock mechanism, while some seismic activity is also seen on an <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault.</b> Our results suggest he active fault plane to be the Deskati fault which dips at a constant angle and therefore branches on the Paleohori fault where surface breaks were observed.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method for imaging shallow faults by {{migration}} of transmitted refraction arrivals. The {{assumption is that}} there is a significant velocity contrast across the fault boundary that is underlain by a refracting interface. This procedure, denoted as refraction migration with fault flooding, largely overcomes the difficulty in imaging shallow faults with seismic surveys. Numerical results successfully validate this method on three synthetic examples and two field-data sets. The first field-data set is next to the Gulf of Aqaba and the second example is from a seismic profile recorded in Arizona. The faults detected by refraction migration in the Gulf of Aqaba data were in agreement with those indicated in a P-velocity tomogram. However, a new fault is detected at the end of the migration image that is not clearly seen in the traveltime tomogram. This result is similar to that for the Arizona data where the refraction image showed faults consistent with those seen in the P-velocity tomogram, except it also detected an <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> at the end of the line. This fault cannot be clearly seen in the traveltime tomogram due to the limited ray coverage...|$|E
40|$|Damage zones show {{very similar}} {{geometries}} {{across a wide}} range of scales and fault types, including strike-slip, normal and thrust faults. We use a geometric classification of damage zones into tip-, wall-, and linking-damage zones, based on their location around faults. These classes can be sub-divided in terms of fault and fracture patterns within the damage zone. A variety of damage zone structures can occur at mode II tips of strike-slip faults, including wing cracks, horsetail fractures, <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults,</b> and synthetic branch faults. Wall damage zones result from the propagation of mode II and mode III fault tips through a rock, or from damage associated with the increase in slip on a fault. Wall damage zone structures include extension fractures, <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults,</b> synthetic faults, and rotated blocks with associated triangular openings. The damage formed at the mode III tips of strike-slip faults (e. g. observed in cliff sections) are classified as wall damage zones, because the damage zone structures are distributed along a fault trace in map view. Mixed-mode tips are likely to show characteristics of both mode II and mode III tips. Linking damage zones are developed at steps between two sub-parallel faults, and the structures developed depend on whether the step is extensional or contractional. Extension fractures and pull-aparts typically develop in extensional steps, whilst solution seams, <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> and synthetic faults commonly develop in contractional steps. Rotated blocks, isolated lenses or strike-slip duplexes may occur in both extensional and contractional steps. Damage zone geometries and structures are strongly controlled by the location around a fault, the slip mode at a fault tip, and by the evolutionary stage of the fault. Although other factors control the nature of damage zones (e. g. lithology, rheology and stress system), the three-dimensional fault geometry and slip mode at each tip must be considered to gain an understanding of damage zones around faults. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Strike–slip faults {{are often}} {{accompanied}} {{by a variety of}} structures, particularly at their tips. The zones of additional fracturing are classified as tip-damage zones. These zones can be subdivided into several different damage patterns based on the nature and orientation of faults and fractures developed. Damage zones at the ends of small strike–slip faults (mode II tips) develop wing cracks, horsetail splays, <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults,</b> synthetic branch faults and solution surfaces. Similar tip-damage patterns are also commonly observed at larger (regional) scales, but with a dominance of faulting over tensile cracks and solution surfaces. Wing cracks and horsetail splays developed at small-scale faults are replaced by normal faults in large-scale <b>faults.</b> <b>Antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> and synthetic branch faults are observed at small and large scales. Thrust faults are developed at large scales, in a similar pattern to solution surfaces at a small scale. All these structures may show slightly different angular relationships to the master fault at small and large scale, but develop in response similar stress distribution and mechanics around the fault. Thus, mode II tip-damage zones show similar patterns over a wide range of fault scales...|$|R
30|$|The {{greater the}} fault throw, the richer the {{remaining}} oil, which {{is controlled by}} two factors. One is that the oil layer at {{the first member of}} the Yaojia Formation tends to be juxtaposed against a top mudstone, so the sealing capacity of faults becomes stronger with increased fault throw. The other is that due to differential subsidence, areas with greater throw of <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> and nearer to the structural high spot are more conducive to the enrichment of remaining oil.|$|R

It is probable that the first earthquake occurred on a fault which outcrops underwater and the second on a fault which is ~isible on land. It appears that the third shock activated an antithetic normal fault dipping southwards on the north side of the Gulf and that the overall structure of the Gulf of Corinth graben is asymmetric. The northern <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> clearly demonstrates the geomorphological changes associated with developing young normal faulting.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust kinematic model that describes northern Red Sea and Gulf of Suez rifting {{and the development}} of marginal extensional half-graben sub-basins (ESB). A combination of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and structural data was used to provide model constraints on the development of rift segments and ESB in the active rift zones. Structural analysis shows rotation and change in strike of rift-bounding faults. The model describes the northern Red Sea region as a poly-phase rift system initiated by late Oligocene (30 - 24 Ma) orthogonal rifting {{and the development of}} marginal ESB (now inland ESB), followed by oblique rifting and flank uplift during the early Miocene (24 - 18 Ma). The oblique rifting fragmented the rift depression into segments separated by oblique-slip accommodation within reactivated Pan-African (ca. 600 Ma) fracture zones, resulting in the development of <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> and an en-echelon distribution of inland ESB. The current phase of rifting was instigated by the development of the Dead Sea Transform in response to increased northeasterly extension during the middle Miocene (ca. 18 Ma).

30|$|The {{structural}} and stratigraphic settings {{of the field}} are mainly controlled by pre- and syn-sedimentary tectonic elements that responded to variable rates of subsidence and sediment supply during Late Eocene to Oligocene times (Doust and Omatsola 1990; Reijers 2011). Structurally, the macrostructures found in the area, according to Evamy et al. (1978); Stacher (1995); Reijers (2011), range from simple rollover anticlines, multiple growth <b>faults,</b> <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> and collapsed crest faults (Fig.  2 c) with most of these faults offsetting at {{different parts of the}} Agbada Formation and flattening into Eocene detachment planes {{near the top of the}} Akata Formation (Reijers et al. 1997).|$|R
5000|$|The offset of {{sand and}} shale beds {{occurring}} along fault planes bring sand and shale layers in contact to each other.

Because the fault plane flattens into décollement, the downthrown block moves basinward and the displaced sedimentary layer of the downthrown block bends close to the fault plane forming rollover anticline, synthetic and <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults.</b> Figure 3 is an E-W seismic line at Svalbard area showing footwall, hanging wall and the geometry of sedimentary layers around the fault plane.|$|R
40|$|Exhumed strike-slip faults {{exposed in}} the Neves {{area of the}} Tauern Window (Eastern Alps, South Tyrol, Italy) formed in the lower brittle crust under hydrous {{conditions}} within effectively intact granodiorite. Faults initiated as segmented en-echelon shear fractures delineating conjugate sets, with segmentation occurring over scales of millimeters to hundred of meters. Slip accumulation on these initial segments was accommodated at contractional stepovers by more distributed faulting of the host rock. Laserscan mapping of a decametric contractional stepover along a fault (Mesule Fault), exposed on a glaciated surface with a rough topography, has allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} structural details and of the kinematic evolution of structures with increasing slip along the segmented fault. In the initial low slip stages, transfer of displacement was accommodated on a set of antithetic faults in the stepover, allowing a decrease in offset toward the tips of the overstep faults. This mechanism was only effective for relatively small fault slip. Further displacement was accommodated by the development of synthetic, sigmoidal by-pass faults providing a hard linkage between overstepped faults, which consistently crosscut deactivated earlier <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> set within the relay ramp. This second stage of evolution is documented in the Mesule Fault, which has a current maximum offset of ca. 20 m.

40|$|Geological and seismological {{observations}} {{have been}} used to parameterize 2 -D numerical elastic models to simulate the interseismic deformation of a complex extensional fault system located in the Northern Apennines (Italy). The geological system is dominated by the presence of the Alto Tiberina fault (ATF), a large (60  km along strike) low-angle normal fault dipping 20 ° in the brittle crust (0 – 15  km).  The ATF is currently characterized by a high and constant rate of microseismic activity, and no moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes have been associated with this fault in the past 1000  years. Modelling results have been compared with GPS data {{in order to understand the}} mechanical behaviour of this fault and a suite of minor syn- and antithetic normal fault segments located in the main fault hanging wall. The results of the simulations demonstrate the active role played by the Alto Tiberina fault in accommodating the ongoing tectonic extension in this sector of the chain. The GPS velocity profile constructed through the fault system cannot be explained without including the ATF's contribution to deformation, indicating that this fault, although misoriented, has to be considered tectonically active and with a creeping behaviour below 5  km depth. The low-angle normal fault also shows a high degree of tectonic coupling with its main <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> (the Gubbio fault), suggesting that creeping along the ATF may control the observed strain localization and the pattern of microseismic activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Thesis is {{to obtain}} a better {{understanding}} of the mechanical behavior of the active Alto Tiberina normal fault (ATF). Integrating geological, geodetic and seismological data, we perform 2 D and 3 D quasi-static and dynamic mechanical models to simulate the interseismic phase and rupture dynamic of the ATF. Effects of ATF locking depth, synthetic and <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> activity, lithology and realistic fault geometries are taken in account. The 2 D and 3 D quasi-static model results suggest that the deformation pattern inferred by GPS data is consistent with a very compliant ATF zone (from 5 to 15 km) and Gubbio fault activity. The presence of the ATF compliant zone is a first order condition to redistribute the stress in the Umbria-Marche region; the stress bipartition between hanging wall (high values) and footwall (low values) inferred by the ATF zone activity could explain the microseismicity rates that are higher in the hanging wall respect to the footwall. The interseismic stress build-up is mainly located along the Gubbio fault zone and near ATF patches with higher dip (30 °<dip< 37 °) that we hypothesize can fail seismically even if a typical Byerlee friction (0. 6 - 0 - 75) is assumed. Finally, the results of 3 D rupture dynamic models demonstrate that the magnitude expected, after that an event is simulated on the ATF, can decrease if we consider the fault plane roughness...|$|E

40|$|Analogue model {{experiments}} {{using both}} brittle and viscous materials {{were performed to}} investigate the development and interaction of strike-slip faults in zones of distributed shear deformation. At low strain, bulk dextral shear deformation of an initial rectangular model is dominantly accommodated by left-stepping, en echelon strike-slip faults (Riedel shears, R) that form {{in response to the}} regional (bulk) stress field. Push-up zones form in the area of interaction between adjacent left-stepping Riedel shears. In cross sections, faults bounding push-up zones have an arcuate shape or merge at depth. Adjacent left-stepping R shears merge by sideways propagation or link by short synthetic shears that strike subparallel to the bulk shear direction. Coalescence of en echelon R shears results in major, through-going faults zones (master faults). Several parallel master faults develop due to the distributed nature of deformation. Spacing between master faults is related to the thickness of the brittle layers overlying the basal viscous layer. Master faults control to a large extent the subsequent fault pattern. With increasing strain, relatively short <b>antithetic</b> and synthetic <b>faults</b> develop mostly between old, but still active master faults. The orientation and evolution of the new faults indicate local modifications of the stress field. In experiments lacking lateral borders, closely spaced parallel <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> (cross faults) define blocks that undergo clockwise rotation about a vertical axis with continuing deformation.

40|$|We perform dynamic rupture {{simulations}} {{to investigate}} the possible reactivation of backthrust branches triggered by ruptures along a main thrust fault. Simulations with slip-weakening fault friction and uniform initial stress show that fast propagation speed or long propagation distance of the main rupture promotes reactivation of backthrust over a range of branch angles. The latter condition may occur separately from the former if rupture speed is limited by an increasing slip-weakening distance towards the junction direction. The results suggest a trade-off between the amplitude and duration of the dynamic stress near the main rupture front for backthrust reactivation. Termination of the main rupture by a barrier can provide enhanced loading amplitude and duration along a backthrust rooted near the barrier, facilitating its reactivation especially with a high frictional resistance. The free surface and depth-dependent initial stress can have several additional effects. The sign of the triggered motion along the backthrust can be reversed from thrust to normal if a deeply nucleated main rupture breaks the free surface, while it is preserved as thrust if the main rupture is terminated by a barrier at depth. The numerical results are discussed in relation to several recent megathrust earthquakes in Sumatra, Chile, and Japan, and related topics such as branch feedbacks to the main fault. The dynamic view on backthrust fault branching provided by the study fills a gap not covered by quasi-static models or observations. A specific examined case of <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> branching may be useful for indicating a barrier-like behavior along the main fault...|$|E

Two main SW dipping segments, the L’Aquila and Campotosto faults, forming an en echelon system 40 km long (NW trending). The 16 km long L’Aquila fault shows a planar geometry with constant dip (∼ 48 °) through the entire upper crust down to 10 km depth. The Campotosto fault activated by three events with 5. 0 ≤ MW ≤ 5. 2 shows a striking listric geometry, composed by planar segments with different dips along depth rather than a smoothly curving single fault surface. The investigation of the spatiotemporal evolution of foreshock activity within the crustal volume where the subsequent L’Aquila main shock nucleated allows us to image the progressive activation of the main fault plane.

Because of this paleoseismic history, the East Potrillo Fault potentially poses a significant seismic hazard to the over 2 million residents living in the border region. Our study presents two 2 D seismic reflection profiles to give the first subsurface image of the East Potrillo Fault and potentially other subsidiary faults that have not broken the surface. Three faults are identified in the subsurface, two of which were previously unknown. The range bounding fault is identified 300 m west of observed fault scarps. The fault scarp is found to be formed from one of two secondary faults. It dips 75 °s east and has a fault offset of 150 m. The other secondary fault is an <b>antithetic</b> <b>fault</b> dipping 75 °s west and forms a graben within the EPF system. The vibroseis source data acquisition is found to be beneficial for characterizing unknown subsurface features. ...|$|E

The geometric models how that fault shape, fault displace-ment, and patterns of aggradation/erosion profoundly affect the distribution of growth beds, the magnitude and direction of dipof pregrowth and growth beds, and the location and dip of the outer limit of folding in pregrowth and growth beds. Complex structural and stratigraphic patterns develop if the rate of aggradation/erosion relative to the rate of fault displacement changes through time. The experimental models (with dry sand and wet clay) show that several deformational styles can accommodate extensional fault-bend folding. In sand models, a few, relatively major, secondary <b>antithetic</b> normal <b>faults</b> accommodate most hanging wall deformation. Pregrowth layers, although faulted, remain flat. The effective shear direction parallels the <b>antithetic</b> normal <b>faults,</b> and the shear angle is about 60 ~ ~ In clay models, numerous, relatively minor, secondary normal <b>faults</b> (<b>antithetic</b> and synthetic) and cataclastic flow accommodate most hanging wall deformation. The deformed pregrowth and growth layers dip gently toward the main fault. The effective shear angle (35 ~ ~) is considerably less than the dip of the antitheti...|$|R

This study reports an investigation of the structure and stratigraphy of the downdip Yegua sandstones at Edna Field, Jackson County, South Texas. The study is based on 22. 9 square miles of three dimensional (3 -D) seismic data, well-logs from 15 wells, 9 paleontologic reports, 3 check-shot velocity surveys and 2 synthetic seismograms. The seismic sequence stratigraphic approaches are used to infer structural and stratigraphic features that may have been overlooked from the previous interpretations. Four sequence boundaries or correlative paleohorizons are interpreted within the Yegua interval: Discorbis yegua (38. 2 Ma), Nodosaria mexicana (38. 8 Ma), Anomalina umbonatus (39. 5 Ma), and one horizon denoted as Noforaminifera. Information generated from structure and isochron maps are used to delineate the depositional history of the downdip Yegua. Seismic data indicated that the study area is dominated by a long southwest northeast oriented normal growth <b>fault.</b> Several growth-fault-related <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> developed on the downthrown side of the major fault, creating a series of subparallel fault system. Analysis of the time structure and-isochron maps suggests the growth fault {{plays an important role in}} providing sediment accomodation space. Sediments were accumulated in a number of small depocenters and were scattered largely along the downthrown side of the growth <b>fault.</b> The growth-fault-related <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults</b> are believed to control the sediment fairways and sediment thickness. Lack of good biostratigraphic control made it difficult to identify depositional sequences and system tracts in Yegua interval with confidence. On the basis of seismic data and well-log data, the Yegua sequences are interpreted as either lowstand basin floor fan or lowstand slope fan. This lowstand fan is deposited during the latest part of relative sea level fall and beginning of relative sea level rise...|$|R
40|$|Syn-sedimentary, sub-seismic scale extensional faults in poorly lithified Pliocene {{sandstones}} {{are well}} exposed {{in an abandoned}} quarry SW of the Tarquinia village (Central Italy). Geometry and spatial distribution of main normal fault segments, and related deformational features (including secondary synthetic and <b>antithetic</b> <b>faults,</b> fault rocks, joints, deformation bands) were carefully mapped in detail both along and across major fault strikes. Fault segments are 20 - 30 m long and strike mainly NW-SE. They are partially overlapped and connected by either relay ramps or transfer faults. Kinematic analyses on fault slickensides indicate nearly pure dip-slip sense of movement. Estimated displacements (throws) never exceed 15 m. Fault damage zones are 5 - 10 m wide and consist of subsidiary synthetic and <b>antithetic</b> normal <b>faults,</b> extensional fractures and deformation bands. Their relative abundance and distribution is strongly controlled by the position within the fault zones. Subsidiary faults and deformation bands accommodate most of the total deformation in approaching the fault tips. On the other hand, indurated master slip surfaces accommodate most displacement in the central sectors of the fault zones. Near vertical, 5 - 10 cm spaced joints are frequent in their footwall damage zones. Cumulative statistical analysis of joint data indicates that they are systematically orthogonal to the fault strike. Joint paralleling the fault strike are strongly subordinated. Detailed AMS analyses were also {{carried out in the}} proper rock types along transects perpendicular to fault strikes. Results show that K 1 orientations are consistent with the stretching directions inferred from structural data. Magnetic fabrics appear reworked in approaching fault surfaces. Based on these integrated information, we propose a structural evolutionary model for normal fault growth in poorly lithified sediments, which involves the development of fault strike-perpendicular joints during the lateral migration of fault tips. Numerical-analytical modelling (FRAPtre) validates the proposed evolutionary pathway and shows that such a fracture evolution and distribution may have a considerable impact on the fluid flow modelling for the successful exploitation of fractured reservoirs...|$|R
