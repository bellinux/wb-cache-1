25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{philosophers}} of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, {{as a main}} cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in [...] "Ji Yeon." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was {{brought back to the}} show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Kelley's character, Walt, was [...] "benched" [...] {{for the majority of the}} second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing [...] "Through the Looking Glass".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E

2500|$|According to David A. Morse (1907–199) {{during an}} 1977 interview, in 1949, who had lately been {{general counsel of}} the NLRB and was then U.S. {{delegate}} to the International Labor Conference of the [...] International Labour Organization (ILO), said: [...] At about that time, I think there were <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> being raised about certain people in the Labor Board; not so much about their qualifications as their political orientation and what Paul Herzog wrote there may have been as a result of that. I remember there was this chap, Nat Witt, who had been head of the unit at the NLRB, that was responsible for the examiners. I recall that he had been accused from time to time by outside groups for being much tied in with Lee Pressman {{and the two of them}} were very much tied in with the Communist Party. [...] In 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt was Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.|$|E

2500|$|Stockler {{arrived in}} Lisbon and was {{immediately}} arrested, by order of the Cortes, resulting in a long process in the press, debates and ridicule. His actions were refuted by Luiz Manuel de Moura Cabral, of the Casa da Supplicação, in letters that described the events {{on the island of}} Terceira, in addition to illustrated observations in Campeão Lisbonense, Voz da Verdade provada por documentos and the pamphlet Voz da Verdade, as well as an analysis of the libelous Noticia resumida dos acontecimentos da ilha Terceira na installação do seu governo constitucional. Finally, Stockler responded in his own name in some critical notes, published in 1822 by Dr. Vicente José Ferreira Cardoso da Costa, to the Count of Arcos. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> and judicial processes end with the fall of the constitutional government in 1823, resulting from the Vilafrancada, leaving Stockler with an unblemished record {{in the eyes of the}} absolutist government. As a result, on 10 June 1823, it was concluded that Stockler provided loyal service to the Crown within the legals bestowed on him, and his career rehabilitated, along with Bishop Manuel Nicolau de Almeida. As one of the politicians liberated in the aftermath, Stockler was seen as a celebrity, and nominated to elaborate the Legal Charter, following the revocation of the former-constitution. But, the commission was extinguished before ever producing a new Charter, and Stockler was re-appointed Captain-General of the Azores and invested with title of Baron of Vila da Praia by decree, [...] on the 29 September 1823.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (a {{think tank}} founded by [...] "a {{small group of}} visionary Americans {{committed}} to advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East") argued that the U.S.-Israel relationship is [...] "A Strategic Asset for the United States." [...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this kind of support. [...] There are obviously differences, but the principle is the same." ...|$|E
