Unsure whether he would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E

Luis {{is also one of the}} major reasons Claire was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>attending</b> the school, despite Countess Ulshyrra's efforts.|$|R
50|$|After {{the family}} moved to the United States in 1920, it was a {{challenge}} to find a school for Mary Elizabeth <b>to</b> <b>attend.</b> Only when a druggist from the neighborhood allowed an employee to carry Mary Elizabeth was she <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>attend</b> a school.

5|$|Dennie had health trouble {{throughout}} his life, {{as well as}} a predilection for wine. His father (who had battled mental illness) died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> his father's funeral, as he himself was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief.

His epitaph was written by John Quincy Adams.

40|$|Background:  Research {{indicates}} minors over 14 -years have capacity, yet, in England and Wales, only over- 16 s {{are legally}} presumed <b>able</b> <b>to</b> consent. This study compared 14 / 15 - and 16 -year-olds' decision-making about attending CAMHS. Method:  Questionnaire-based study of 1129 14 - 16 -year-olds. Results:  Fewer 16 -year-olds think parents contribute to decision-making. There {{were no significant}} differences between 14 / 15 - and 16 -year-olds in relation to thinking they have the final say, voluntariness or information preferences. Four-fifths wanted a range of information and thought it should be provided to all young people, not just those referred. Conclusions:  14 / 15 -year-olds are as likely as 16 -year-olds <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> consent <b>to</b> <b>attending</b> CAMHS...|$|R
5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because she would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E

Only 12 delegates attended the congress, with neither Li nor Chen being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend,</b> the latter sending a personal representative in his stead. The resolutions of the congress called {{for the establishment of a}} communist party (as a branch of the Communist International) and elected Chen as its leader.|$|E

According to family tradition, Carroll secured a position as clerk to William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, an Englishman who was one of two Catholic peers in the court of James II.|$|E
50|$|The yobikō is not equally {{accessible}} to students. A national survey and a survey on the Hiroshima {{branch of a}} yobikō, which {{could be considered a}} typical one, found that more males attend yobikō than females.
