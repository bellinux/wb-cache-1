5|$|The Royal Navy force {{took only}} {{ten minutes to}} disable the corvettes. They then began to pull {{survivors}} out of the sea, but the rescue was suspended at about 22:30, when the TA 20 {{was picked up by}} radar and fired upon. The first salvo hit her bridge killing all officers, <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> out her fire-control system. She sank close to Pag Island. Neither TA 20, nor the corvettes managed to radio news of the attack.|$|E
5|$|After moving inland, the storm's northwestward track {{brought it}} over the Louisiana border on two {{separate}} occasions, first reaching Washington Parish as a minimal hurricane. Winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees, damaging houses <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> out power to over 15,000 customers in the process. The hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strewn debris throughout communities such as Bogalusa and Franklinton in Washington Parish, the hardest-hit area in the state. Downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses, chiefly near Bogalusa.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) {{wishes to}} conduct a further {{post-mortem}} on Laura's body, but it is due to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> him down. Later, Rosenfield shares what he has found; Laura had been bound when she was killed, had been addicted to cocaine, and had been clawed by a bird. An unidentified plastic shard was also found in her stomach.|$|E

5|$|In December 1923, {{while visiting}} the Winchester {{residence}} of W. A. Baker, a fellow {{director of the}} Winchester and Western Railroad, Cornwell was rendered unconscious after a large longcase clock in a hallway toppled over, striking him on the head, <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> him down.

He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the game see Sonic and Tails chasing Robotnik through West Side Island, and {{eventually}} up to the Death Egg, pursuing him with Tails' biplane, the Tornado. The plane is damaged after being shot at, but Sonic still manages to infiltrate the Death Egg, alone. Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant mech. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> it out of orbit. Sonic {{falls to the ground}} and is saved by Tails in the Tornado. If the player has collected all of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic, in his Super Sonic form, flies alongside it.|$|E
5|$|Hughes faced BJ Penn on November 20, 2010, in {{a rubber}} match at , after their {{previous}} two fights at UFC 46 and UFC 63. Penn came out {{strong in the}} first few seconds of the opening round, catching one of Hughes' kicks <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> him off balance with a counter hook. Penn then connected with an overhand right that dropped Hughes, following up with three clean shots to the jaw. The bout was ended at 21 seconds into the first round, with Hughes trilogy against Penn ending at 1-2. The fight marked the first time Hughes had been knocked out (he had previously lost via technical knockout). Post-fight Hughes hinted that the loss moved him one step closer to retirement.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, he was {{involved}} in a horrific on-field incident with Geelong's Steven King. As King attempted to kick the ball out of mid-air, he missed and collected White's face {{at the height of his}} leg's swing, causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery, inserting five metal plates and 14screws into White's jaw and face. It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King. As the incident took place in Melbourne's final match of the season—Geelong winning the match <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> Melbourne out of the finals—White was able to recover during the off-season and did not miss a match, despite the severity of the injury. White's wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was {{followed}} by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in {{the final of the}} Malta Cup. After the victory, {{he said it was a}} relief to get rid of the one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the prime}} universe, Nina Sharp helps {{to set up}} Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is the only option. Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news. She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine to stop what is already happening.|$|E
5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|On Kyushu, Zeb damaged houses, marred crops, and flooded rivers. The storm {{spawned a}} tornado in Miyazaki Prefecture that damaged two roofs and a vehicle. In Saganoseki, a {{motorist}} died after a roadway collapse landed his vehicle {{in a nearby}} river. On Shikoku, Zeb destroyed roads and farmlands and eroded lands along waterways. Three people died due to a landslide in Matsuyama. In Okayama Prefecture along Honshu, Zeb left six people missing or killed and was the costliest typhoon since Typhoon Fran in 1976. Landslides killed three people in Hiroshima Prefecture. Power outages and landslides affected much of Honshu, while strong winds damaged many fields. A cargo freighter washed aground amid high waves in Shizuoka Prefecture, causing oil to leak and requiring assistance from the Coast Guard; oil recovery equipment {{was sent to the}} area to clean the spill. Lastly, Zeb affected the northern island of Hokkaido, causing one landslide, damaging 152buildings, <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> 152,000apples to the ground. Nationwide, Zeb destroyed 770homes and flooded another 12,548, with thousands forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. Overall, there were 14deaths and 67injuries, with damage estimated at $335.5million (1998USD).|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn native {{began the}} busier fighter, using the jab {{and trying to}} land uppercuts {{for the first two}} rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse {{displayed}} more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked up the pace, beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to show more power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw. Judah got up but he was hurt, and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout. Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{encounters}} {{took place}} as the Battle of Hannut was being fought in Belgium. The results were much the same. On the southern face of Bulson, General Friedrich Kirchner, commander of the 1st Panzer Division, suffered several tactical reverses and saw the 37mm shells from his 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank guns and Panzer IIIs bounce off the more heavily armoured French tanks. A number of the German tanks were knocked out in rapid succession. The Germans had to hold the French at the ridge. Kirchner was forced to send in his tanks in dribs and drabs, tactics which Guderian hated, but which he himself decided {{there was no other}} recourse. It was once again the German tanks' radio equipment that enabled them to move around quickly and communicate with one another, to change the point of defence or attack quickly. The speed of the German tanks also enabled them to offset their inferiority in combat power to the French tanks. Often, the Panzer III and IVs could speed into the rear of French formations, closing quickly <b>and</b> <b>knocking</b> out the French armour from the rear. The Germans noted the particular weakness between the chassis and turret of the French tanks, which were vulnerable to their fire.|$|E
