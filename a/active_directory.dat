40|$|The {{increased}} attention of E-auction services in mobile E-commerce demands {{an approach to}} identify the relevant auctions as per the bidder’s requirements so as to increase the bidder satisfaction level and auction winning probability. In this paper, we propose an intelligent agent based model to identify the relevant set of auctions for a mobile bidder based on the bidder’s requirements, preferences and constraints from a set of active auctions available in the <b>active</b> auction service <b>directory</b> in regional gateway connected to Internet. The agent functions are based on Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) cognitive architecture and are capable of taking dynamic decisions to search the matching auctions for the products requested by the bidder in the bidder belief set located in the bidder’s mobile device and/or in the case base of the regional gateway. If matching auctions are not found in either of them, BDI agent searches them in the <b>active</b> auction service <b>directory</b> and computes the relevance factor based on the parameters in the bidder’s requirements for all the matching active auctions and clusters into relevant (or potential) and non relevant auctions. The model is simulated to test the performance measures like availability of relevant auctions, average response time, and probability of winning auctions with better satisfaction. The proposed model is also compared with advertisement based auction service discovery model to show its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel, pipelined resource management architecture for computational grids. The design {{is based on}} two key realizations. One is that resource management involves a sequence of tasks that is best handled by a pipeline. As shown in the paper, this approach results in a scalable architecture for decentralized scheduling. The other realization is that static aggregation of resources for improved scheduling is inadequate in wide-area computing environments because the needs of users and jobs change with both, location and time. The described architecture addresses this problem by dynamically aggregating resources {{in a manner that}} continuously optimizes system response. This is accomplished by way of an <b>active</b> yellow pages <b>directory</b> that allows aggregation constraints to be (re) de ned on the y. An initial prototype of the active yellow pages service has been deployed in the PUNCH network computing environment. Experiences with the production PUNCH system and preliminary results from controlled experiments indicate that the active yellow pages service performs well. 1...|$|R

40|$|The nation's American Indian and Alaska Native {{population}} has unique demographic characteristics, which imply distinctive healthcare needs {{for the population}} and for the healthcare providers who serve them. This population also has unique health care problems, including the highest prevalence of diabetes {{in the world and}} a high incidence of unintentional injures as a cause of death. New Mexico has the fourth largest American Indian population in the US and the largest percentage (9 %) in the lower 48 states. It is home to the 19 Pueblos, the Mescalero Apache, the Jicarilla Apache and the Navajo Nation. The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Library and Informatics Center (UNM HSLIC) has a full-time faculty position for a Native Services Librarian. This position was initially funded through the Tribal Connections Four Corners collaboration and is now funded fully by UNM. A survey of academic health sciences libraries directors indicated that HSLIC is the only academic health sciences library in the country with a full-time position dedicated to serving Native Americans. HSLIC has made Native Services a major strategic goal as well, and a team has developed the Native American Health Information Services (NAHIS) program. The goal of the NAHIS program at the HSLIC is to consolidate and expand Native American Health Information Services by creating a strong integrated, effective program so that the HSLIC contributes to the reduction of health disparities through improved health information services to the Native American population of the New Mexico and those who provide health care for them. This has required identifying current services, resources, partnerships and funding and selecting those services, resources, partnerships and funding to create a strong Native American Health Information Services program. Recent activities have included completing a logic model for evaluation, designing a brochure and beginning design of a web site. The program’s first year target audience is the Native American faculty, staff, and students on the University of New Mexico campus. Other audiences have been identified for years 2 - 5 of the program to expand to the rest of New Mexico. Two resources serve as cornerstones of the HSLIC Native American Health Information Services program. The Tribal Connections Four Corners Go Local on MedlinePlus provides Native Americans living in the Four Corners with an <b>active</b> online <b>directory</b> of health services. It was launched in October 2005. The Native Health Research Database and Native Health History Database, both created at UNM HSLIC, provide information for the benefit, use and education of organizations and individuals with an interest in American Indian, Alaska Native and Canadian First Nations health-related issues, programs and initiatives.

A number of features from Windows 98 were incorporated also, such as an improved Device Manager, Windows Media Player, and a revised DirectX {{that made it possible}} for the first time for many modern games to work on the NT kernel.

Windows 8.1 also introduces improved fingerprint recognition APIs, which allows user login, User Account Control, Windows Store and Windows Store apps to use enrolled fingerprints as an authentication method. A new kiosk mode known as [...] "Assigned Access" [...] was also added, allowing a device to be configured to use a single app in a restricted environment.
