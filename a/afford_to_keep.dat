5|$|Allardyce {{was hired}} as a player-coach by Brian Talbot at West Bromwich Albion in February 1989. He spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1988–89 season at The Hawthorns {{managing}} and playing for the reserve team, before being promoted to first team coach in the summer, in a move that saw former first team coach Stuart Pearson demoted to reserve team coaching. Allardyce and Talbot were sacked in January 1991 following a defeat to Isthmian League side Woking in the FA Cup. He later worked as a part-time coach at Bury, but manager Mike Walsh could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him on the staff for the 1989–90 season.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was born}} into the Kikuyu people {{in the village of}} Ngenda, which lay in an area of sugar cane and cattle pasture. His father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They were shamba folk, living in a {{homestead}} built on a spur of land near the River Thiririka; they were farmers, raising crops and breeding both sheep and goats. Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> several wives, each of whom lived in a separate nyom ba (woman's hut).|$|E

60|$|Excepting {{the case}} of supper, which could be easily provided, the {{landlord}} {{had no choice but}} to disappoint both his guests. In his small way of business, none of his customers wanted to hire a carriage--even if he could have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> one. As for beds, the few rooms which the inn contained were all engaged; including even the room occupied by himself and his wife. An exhibition of agricultural implements had been opened in the neighborhood, only two days since; and a public competition between rival machines was to be decided on the coming Monday. Not only was the Hand-in-Hand inn crowded, but even the accommodation offered by the nearest town had proved barely sufficient to meet the public demand.|$|R
5|$|The size of Chnodomar's cavalry is unknown, but was {{probably}} {{a small proportion of}} the total, as the Alamanni's heavily forested land was not suited to large-scale cavalry operations. Most of the Alamanni horsemen were noblemen and their retainers, as only they could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a warhorse. Chnodomar's cavalry is unlikely to have exceeded 1,750 horse in total, assuming that the cavalry element was similar to the 7% cavalry element in the early Roman citizen legion, as the latter was also recruited exclusively from the wealthiest classes.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the estate}} was {{acquired}} by the Moseley family of Manchester and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Anne Moseley {{was the last of}} this family to hold the manor, as her husband could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it following her death. It was purchased by John Davenport, who bequeathed it to the Bamford family when he died childless in 1760. After the last Bamford died without male issue in 1806, the estate passed to Robert Hesketh who took the name Bamford-Hesketh; it is from this family that the Hesketh Tavern public house in Cheadle Hulme got its name. The last person to hold the manor was Winifred, Countess of Dundonald, one of Bamford-Hesketh's descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the rail {{connections}} was a death blow to the stage road. Gold production in Independence had declined sharply after 1884, {{and many of the}} town's early settlers had moved down the valley to Aspen. With the corresponding reduction in stage traffic and tolls, the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the road clear over the winter of 1886. Two years later, after the railroads began service, the company folded and abandoned the road. Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899, leaving its buildings standing as a ghost town (one remaining resident lingered until 1920).|$|E

60|$|LARRY [coming down on Mat promptly]. I'll tell you, Mat. I {{always thought}} it was a stupid, lazy, good-for-nothing sort of thing to leave the land {{in the hands of the}} old landlords without calling them to a strict account for the use they made of it, and the {{condition}} of the people on it. I could see for myself that they thought of nothing but what they could get out of it to spend in England; and that they mortgaged and mortgaged until hardly one of them owned his own property or could have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it up decently if he'd wanted to. But I tell you plump and plain, Mat, that if anybody thinks things will be any better now that the land is handed over to a lot of little men like you, without calling you to account either, they're mistaken.|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{poverty is}} a problem {{particularly}} associated with the lives and living conditions of older people, {{in part because of}} their vulnerability to health impacts. This article draws attention {{to the ways in which}} older people on low incomes cope with and adapt <b>to</b> problems of <b>affording</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> warm at home. We present findings from interviews with 17 households during the winter of 2012 – 2013 in England. The importance of keeping warm was recognised across the interviews. Four particular categories of coping strategies were defined and used—responsively adjusting the length of time and parts of the home for which heating is kept on, using secondary heating sources; using additional layers that help <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> bodies warm; and adjusting daily routines. We found that it was rare for people themselves to problematize the ways in which they were coping day to day, they largely just saw this as what they did to get by and to control the size of their energy bills. Coping strategies raise questions about what are acceptable living conditions, how judgments are made and how assistance can be provided when householders do not themselves problematize their situation. Implications for action to tackle fuel poverty are considered...|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1980, the rumours {{surrounding}} CATIA {{reached the}} very top of the company and Marcel Dassault, then aged 88, asked for a demonstration of the software capabilities. The company management understood the engineers' vision and started to discuss how to leverage their innovation. They quickly realised they could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and develop this invention internally and decided to create a new company - led by Francis Bernard - to explore the Computer-aided Design and Computer-aided Manufacturing market (CAD/CAM).|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} phase of Project C, James Bevel, SCLC's Director of Direct Action, {{introduced}} a revolutionary and controversial new tactic to use young people in the demonstrations. Most adults were working and could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> losing time at work. On May 2, 1963, the first youths and students walked out of the 16th Street Baptist Church and attempted to march to Birmingham's City Hall to talk to the Mayor.

50|$|The World Team {{could not}} <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> blindly <b>keep</b> racing the b-pawn forward with 29...b4, because the white queen still guarded the b3-square, which Black {{would have to}} lose a tempo to guard before {{advancing}} again. The move 29...Qc4, in contrast, did not lose a tempo, because Kasparov could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> trade queens {{in a way that}} would have undoubled the black pawns and given the World Team a central pawn steamroller for the endgame. The alternative 29...Qe2 also might have held the fort for Black, by offering to exchange the white h-pawn for the black f-pawn. However, as part of the trade, the bishops would also have come off, and none of the four analysts was prepared to trade the World Team's lovely bishop for Kasparov's cramped one just yet.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} shops and other services, {{there used to}} be a local shop which sold fresh rolls in the morning as well as milk and other items. Although this is now closed as it was no longer subsidised. This means locals now have to travel to other villages like Malenice (as they're minted and can <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it) and Čkyně. They can also walk up to the petrol station (read more below) however this walk {{involves}} crossing the dangerously busy Route 4 road. The original shop was closed and opened into a pub, for a few years but has now, like the shop, closed down. There is a kiosk in lower Lčovice which is a pub, where you can sit outside next to the Volyňka and is perfect after a long walk (or a refreshing drink after cycling on the 1233 cycle route). Originally {{there used to be}} a school in the village but was closed and is now the major's offices where all meetings and discussions about the village take place.|$|R
25|$|Two legends exist which feature Isabella de Forz.

25|$|Two {{years later}} Turner's team {{eliminated}} Blackburn Rovers, {{who at the}} time lay second in the First Division, in the fifth round of the FA Cup. They thus became the first Fourth Division side to reach the sixth round. In 1964–65, he led them to promotion from the Fourth Division, and three years later to the championship of the Third. By this time the young players who had been the mainstay of Oxford's rise through the divisions were ageing or retired. Turner had no money to strengthen the side for its Second Division campaign, and struggled with what he had. In April 1969, he became General Manager of the club, leaving the running of the team to Ron Saunders, and in February 1972 he was dismissed when the club admitted they were unable to <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him in post.|$|E

40|$|As {{energy prices}} {{continue}} to rise to reflect the real cost of carbon, the numbers of households in fuel poverty is increasing rapidly. This paper uses a unique data set to explore one alternative measure of fuel poverty based on whether consumers feel able <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> their energy, similar to one introduced by the government a few years ago. We explore the links between an expenditure based and our subjective measure of fuel poverty and compare these differences with those between official measures. Amongst low income households, 28 % {{spent more than a}} tenth of their income on energy in the home, and so would be likely to qualify as fuel poor under the most usual definition; but only 16 % felt unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> sufficient energy <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their homes warm. Amongst this group who felt they had difficulty in affording sufficient energy, less than half were ‘expenditure’ fuel poor. The paper argues that reintroduction of a self-reported measure by the government would be a valuable aid to policy development...|$|R
25|$|Turner kept {{ownership}} of MGM from March 25 to August 26, 1986. He racked up huge debts and Turner {{simply could not}} <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the studio under those circumstances. To recoup his investment, Turner sold the production/distribution assets and trademarks of MGM to United Artists, while retaining the pre-May 1986 MGM, Associated Artists Productions (the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library and Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios Popeye cartoons) and RKO Radio Pictures libraries as well as Gilligan's Island and its animated spin-offs. The studio lot was sold to Lorimar-Telepictures, which was later acquired by Warner Bros.; in 1990, the lot was sold to Sony Corporation's Columbia Pictures Entertainment {{in exchange for the}} half of Warner's lot that it had rented since the 1970s. Also in 1990, the MGM studio was purchased by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, who then merged the former Cannon with the MGM purchase to create the short-lived MGM-Pathé Communications. Parretti defaulted on the loans he'd used to buy the studio, leaving the studio {{in the hands of the}} French bank, Credit Lyonnais. Credit Lyonnais invested significant sums to revive the moribund studio and eventually sold it back to Kerkorian in 1996. Kerkorian soon expanded the company, purchasing Orion Pictures, The Samuel Goldwyn Company and Motion Picture Corporation of America from John Kluge's Metromedia in 1997, and bought a majority to the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library from its parent Philips, which was in process to sell PolyGram to Seagram.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{got off to}} a 13–2 {{start in}} 2002–03, but hit the wall after the All-Star break thanks in no small part to Ron Artest's {{multiple}} suspensions and family tragedies befalling Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley and Austin Croshere. O'Neal and Brad Miller both made the All-Star team and the Pacers made a substantial improvement as they finished 48–34, but they suffered a loss to the underdog Boston Celtics {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. In the 2003 offseason, the Pacers managed to re-sign O'Neal for the NBA maximum and inked Reggie Miller to a modest two-year deal, but they could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their talented center, Brad Miller. He was dealt to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard, who spent much of the following year watching from the bench and backing up Jeff Foster. The Pacers also signed Larry Bird as team president, and Bird wasted little time in dismissing coach Isiah Thomas and replacing him with Rick Carlisle. The Pacers responded to Carlisle extremely well, and had a breakthrough 2003–04 season in which they finished 61–21, earning the best record in the NBA as well as a franchise record. O'Neal and Artest made the All-Star team, and Artest was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year, the Pacers swept the Boston Celtics easily in the first round, and squeezed by a scrappy Miami Heat team in the conference semifinals. But the Detroit Pistons proved an impediment to Indiana's championship aspirations, as they defeated the Pacers in six games on their way to the NBA Championship.|$|E

After substantial thought, Owen reluctantly decides to accompany Cristina to the abortion, uniting the two.
