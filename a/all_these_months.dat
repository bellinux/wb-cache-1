60|$|She. Do {{you mean}} that still? I didn't dare to write {{to you about it}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke the}} truth, a mighty truth which had stood like a {{mountain}} before me <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months,</b> yet which I had not seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Amen!" [...] said M'Leod. [...] "Now, Thea, let us {{have some}} music after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b> 'With mirth, thou pretty bird,' ain't it? You ought to hear that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Guy {{listened to}} it all in {{profound}} silence. It was a strange, and for him a momentous tale. Then he said at last, as Granville finished, [...] "And {{you never told me}} this <b>all</b> <b>these</b> long <b>months,</b> Kelmscott." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Hilda!" [...] exclaimed Kenyon, {{regarding}} {{her with}} wonder and deep sympathy. [...] "My sweet friend, {{have you had}} this secret hidden in your delicate, maidenly heart, through <b>all</b> <b>these</b> many <b>months!</b> No wonder that your life was withering out of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He made an inarticulate {{sound of}} scorn, but, seeing perhaps the {{distress}} in my face, he added more gently, [...] "No, Lucy, {{this is really}} best; I am not fit to be with you. I have broken my word of honour, and lost <b>all</b> that <b>these</b> <b>months</b> had gained. I should only drag Eustace down if I stayed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Melville, old man, {{what are}} you doing here? We {{wondered}} what had become of you, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b> Shake hands, my boy! I'm glad I've found you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean," [...] Louise demanded, [...] "that {{after waiting}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months</b> you started away upon impulse like that--without even letting your brother know or {{bringing}} any luggage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Funny {{to see a}} sunburn {{like that}} in mid-winter,' he replied, frowning. 'I can't think why it should last <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b> Don't you ever put {{anything}} on to heal it?' ...|$|E
50|$|Alofi {{features}} a tropical rainforest climate under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, with no discernible dry season. The {{city has a}} noticeably drier stretch from June through September. However, <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>months</b> average more than 60 mm of rain, the limit for a dry season month. Like other cities with this climate, average temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year, at 25 C.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the first}} {{recognition}} for many a day! and, at the smoothing motion of her hand over him, while she still entreated, [...] "Lie still, my dear," [...] the mutterings died away; the childish instinct of obedience stilled the struggles; {{and there was something}} more like repose than had been seen <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weary <b>months.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I was mad," [...] {{retorted}} the professor. [...] "Could you not {{see that}} I was mad? Oh, why did you not stop me? You were sane enough. You at least might have forced me to abandon the insane obsession which has overpowered my reason for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> terrible <b>months.</b> I am sane now, {{but it is too}} late--too late." ...|$|R
60|$|It's been so wonderful, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b> I've {{never known}} anyone {{to come up}} to you. Everything you said pleased me. I loved the way you walk, and your laugh, and the sound of your voice.|$|E
6000|$|BEATRICE. I know. It's cruel--it's horrible. But I {{told you}} not to hope, Michael. I've done my best. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>months</b> at Mentone, I've been {{wondering}} why I ever let you marry me--when that feeling wasn't dead! ...|$|E
60|$|This is what I've {{been waiting}} for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b> To get the old robbers down, and send them home again without a farthin's worth o' change. I 've seen their faces, I tell you, in {{the valley of the}} shadow of defeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong, quite wrong. Jasper {{is nothing}} to me; I use him as a tool, not you. If I threaten, it is {{to keep you from}} Octavia, who cannot forgive the past and love you for yourself, as I have done <b>all</b> <b>these</b> miserable <b>months.</b> You say I know but half the truth. Tell me the whole and I will spare you." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{knew the}} {{arborescent}} grasses that yielded {{the longest and}} toughest fibers and these she sought and carried to her tree with the spear shaft that was to be. Clambering to her crotch she bent to her work, humming softly a little tune. She caught herself and smiled--it {{was the first time}} in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> bitter <b>months</b> that song had passed her lips or such a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the first}} time for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> six <b>months</b> that we have either of us spoken a word of truth or sense to each other. I never did {{anything}} but trifle with you, and you the same. Now we've come to some plain dry land, we may walk on and be friends. So now help me up these rocks, and I will go home." ...|$|R
60|$|As to the King of Navarre, for whose help Berenger had hoped, he {{had been}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months</b> in the dishonouable thraldom of Catherine de Medicis, and was more {{powerless}} than ever at this juncture, having been implicated in Alencon's plot, and imprisoned at Vincennes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's done me a rare lot of good, but I think I'm wise to {{stay here}} as long as I can. And there are a very nice class of people at the boarding-house. I wanted cheering up after seeing nobody <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b> It was dull sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have so {{wanted to}} see you in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months,</b> Andre. You were {{the only one who could}} help me; the only one who could tell me the truth, and I was angry with you for never having written to say where you were to be found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! let us thank God, Who, after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> black <b>months</b> {{of travel}} and of danger, has thus brought us {{together}} again," [...] and, kneeling down there together in the guest-hall of the lord of Death, they gave thanks earnestly. Then, moving to {{the centre of the}} chamber where they thought that none would hear them, they began to speak in low voices and in English.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't {{think what}} you can have been about, Mr Burns, {{not to have been}} able to do what Cynthia asked you. Surely in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weeks and <b>months....</b> And then, after all, to have let this Fisher scoundrel steal him away from under your nose...!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blair, {{what do you}} know--that I do not know? For long I've {{suspected}} you're wise to--to {{things at}} home. You know I haven't heard much in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> long <b>months.</b> My mother wrote but seldom. Lorna, my kid sister, forgot me, I guess.... Helen always was a poor correspondent. Dal answered my letters, but she never told me anything about home. When we first got to France I heard often from Margie Henderson and Mel Iden--crazy kind of letters--love-sick over soldiers.... But nothing {{for a long time}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I've found you, have I, Douglas?" [...] she cried, {{and there}} was a note of bitter triumph in her words, [...] "found you after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months!</b> Aren't you terrified? Aren't you afraid? No wonder you sit there, {{shrinking}} away! Do you know what I have come for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He drew a long breath, {{and murmured}} bitterly, 'Ah, you are cleverer than I. You can do everything--I can do nothing! O Miss Swancourt!' he burst out wildly, his heart {{swelling}} in his throat, 'I {{must tell you}} how I love you! <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>months</b> of my absence I have worshipped you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must know}} that so far in this {{campaign}} my regiment had never been on the main line of Napoleon's advance. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>months</b> since the invasion the army we belonged to had been wrestling with Oudinot in the north. We had only come down lately, driving him before us to the Beresina.|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>these</b> seven <b>months</b> I {{doubt if}} we can expect more than three mails {{at the best of}} it: and I do hope we may hear {{something}} of your news by each. I have no very clear views as to where the three addresses ought to be, but if you hear no later news, Charles Scribner's Sons will always have the run of our intended movements. And an early letter there would probably catch us at the Sandwich Islands. Tahiti will probably be the second point: and (as I roughly guess) Quito the third. But the whole future is invested with heavenly clouds.|$|R
6000|$|... 'After this day's Ordination {{we shall}} number one Bishop, six Priests, and one Deacon. There are {{three or four}} Melanesians who ought soon to be ordained; {{and if it is}} {{possible}} for me to spend two or three months this next winter at Mota, I must read with George, and perhaps ordain him Priest. It troubles me much that during <b>all</b> <b>these</b> summer <b>months</b> there can be no administration of the Holy Communion, though there are six communicants, besides George, now living for good at Mota. There will be four or five next year taking up their abode at the neighbouring island of Aroa.|$|R
40|$|Leading {{time length}} is an {{important}} issue for modeling seasonal forecasts. In this study, a comparison of the interannual predictability of the Western North Pacific (WNP) summer monsoon between different leading months was performed by using one-, four-, and seven-month lead retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) of four coupled models from Ensembles-Based Predictions of Climate Changes and Their Impacts (ENSEMBLES) for the period of 1960 - 2005. It is found that the WNP summer anomalies, including lower-tropospheric circulation and precipitation anomalies, can be well predicted for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> leading <b>months.</b> The accuracy of the four-month lead prediction is only slightly weaker than that of the one-month lead prediction, although the skill decreases with the increase of leading months...|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt not her resolution," [...] Edmund said; [...] "but none {{can blame}} her if, after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months,</b> she {{has begun to}} despair of rescue; nay, it is even {{probable}} that, having Sweyn, who is assuredly a brave and enterprising Viking, always near her, she may have come to love him." ...|$|E
60|$|For many a {{long day}} Bertram said nothing to her of her actual state of existence. He spoke neither of her past life as a wife nor her present life as a widow. The name of that man, whom living they had both despised and hated, was never {{mentioned}} between them during <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{she began}} to speak. How glad she {{was that she had}} {{prepared}} herself to speak as she would have spoken to any other good friend! So she expressed her joy at seeing him again, well and successful after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>months</b> of peril, toil, and anxiety, and they sat down near each other.|$|E
5000|$|Mrs. Geeta Ram, {{who watched}} {{and played with}} Professor Kasturi as a tiny girl in those days, recalls, [...] "The whole process of {{type-setting}} would be repeated so many times. After the sheets were printed, the ink would still be wet. They would then have to be spread {{all over the floor}} to dry, so the ink would not smear. Later, the pages were carefully collated, stapled together, packed and addressed in preparation for mailing - all done by hand. Although there were a few volunteers to help him, I remember Professor Kasturi doing <b>all</b> <b>these</b> jobs, <b>month</b> in and month out, for so many years. This was truly his labor of love for Swami (Sathya Sai Baba)." ...|$|R
6000|$|To elude the creature, then, {{upon the}} {{possibility}} of discovering some loophole of escape from his predicament seemed to the ape-man the wisest course to pursue. Too much was at stake to risk an encounter that might be avoided--an encounter the outcome of which there was every reason to apprehend would seal {{the fate of the}} mate that he had just found, only to lose again so harrowingly. Yet high as his disappointment and chagrin ran, hopeless as his present estate now appeared, there tingled in the veins of the savage lord a warm glow of thanksgiving and elation. She lived! After <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weary <b>months</b> of hopelessness and fear he had found her. She lived! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Philippa, you are mad!" [...] Helen exclaimed passionately. [...] "Didn't I have {{to realise}} {{all that you}} say when I let Dick go, cheerfully, the day after we were engaged? Haven't I {{realised}} the duty of cheerfulness and sacrifice through <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weary <b>months?</b> But {{there is a limit}} to these things, Philippa, a sense of proportion which must be taken into account. It's Dick's life which is in the balance against some intangible thing, nothing that we could ever reproach ourselves with, nothing that could bring real harm upon any one. Oh, I love my country, too, but I want Dick! I should feel like his murderess all my life, if I didn't consent!" ...|$|R
