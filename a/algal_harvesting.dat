40|$|Although microalgae receive much {{interest}} {{as a potential}} source of biofuel, proteins, and for wastewater treatment, cost-efficient harvesting is still a challenge. This study was performed to investigate the applicability of submerged microfiltration for harvesting both a freshwater green algae species Chlorella vulgaris and a marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum using three lab-made membranes with different porosity. The filtration performance was assessed by assessing their critical flux using the improved flux step method (IFM) and by conducting batch up-concentration filtrations. The cost analysis was in a first approximation estimated based on the data of a related full-scale submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR). Overall results suggest that submerged microfiltration for <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> is economically competitive. The IFM results indicate a low degree of fouling {{within the range of}} applied parameters, comparable to the one obtained for a submerged MBR. The membrane with 0. 037 µm pore size was found to perform best.

40|$|A {{new concept}} {{based on the}} use of {{magnetic}} iron sand for harvesting and extracting the cellular content of microalgae was investigated herein. By employing iron sand, a natural occurring magnetic material, as a filter media in sand filtration and as a heat in AC Magnetic induction heating, previously separate <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> and processing step can potential be carried within the same unit operation, resulting in significant saving in energy and labour cost. Elucidation of the algal capture mechanisms and the heat generating properties of iron sand, as well as the cell content extraction mechanism was required as a proof of concept. A series of advanced characterisation techniques, including Small Angle Light Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, X-Ray Diffraction, Laser Doppler Micro-Electrophoresis and Vibrating Sample Magnetometery was used to characterise the physical and chemical properties of iron sand. The performance of iron sand as a thermal source in magnetic induction heating was shown to be dependent on the magnetic properties of iron sand, which in turn was dependent on the particle size, composition and magnetic domain characteristics. When iron sand was used as a filter media, harvesting efficiencies between 48 % and 82 % can be achieved. Iron sand in the smaller size range (< 150 μm) produced a higher separation effectiveness, but the retention time was high (approximately 275 s over 10 bed volume). The high separation effectiveness and high retention time were due to the cake deposition being the main capture mechanism. Iron sand in the larger size range of 150 μm to 180 μm was able to reduce the retention time remarkably, albeit at a much lower separation effectiveness of 54 % over 10 bed volume; this was due to straining filtration being the main capture mechanism. Chromatographic and fluorescence techniques were then used to determine differences in the organic and lipid characteristic of the algal cell extract. It was found that when iron sand was used as a thermal source for the heat induced extraction of algal cell content, a high level of cell rupture and algal organic matter release were observed using flow cytometry when the algal cells were exposed to temperatures between 125 °C to 185 °C. However, high temperature was also shown to decompose cell component such as lipids, and the lipids detected per cell by magnetic induction heating decreased sharply from 155 °C to 185 °C. Whilst direct comparison (e. g. efficiency, recovery rate etc.) with existing <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> and processing technique is not possible due to the bench scale nature of this study, these findings suggest the use of iron sand for a combined <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> and processing process is viable and warrant further investigations...|$|E

40|$|For the {{large-scale}} cultivation of microalgae for biodiesel production, {{one of the}} key problems is the determination of the optimum time for <b>algal</b> <b>harvest</b> when algae cells are saturated with neutral lipids. In this study, a method to determine the optimum harvest time in oil-producing microalgal cultivations by measuring the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), also called Fv/Fm, was established. When oil-producing Chlorella strains were cultivated and then treated with nitrogen starvation, it not only stimulated neutral lipid accumulation, but also affected the photosynthesis system, with the neutral lipid contents in all four algae strains – Chlorella sorokiniana C 1, Chlorella sp. C 2, C. sorokiniana C 3, C. sorokiniana C 7 – correlating negatively with the Fv/Fm values. Thus, for the given oil-producing algae, in which a significant relationship between the neutral lipid content and Fv/Fm value under nutrient stress can be established, the optimum harvest time can be determined by measuring the value of Fv/Fm. It is hoped that this method can provide an efficient way to determine the harvest time rapidly and expediently in large-scale oil-producing microalgae cultivations for biodiesel production...|$|R

Egg biochemical composition was relatively stable when diets were fed to animals in a partially conditioned state, but varied more for wild eggs compared to lab-conditioned animals. When diet treatments were initiated earlier in a second experiment, differences among the fatty acid composition of gonad samples were more apparent. [...] In larval feeding trials, fatty acids in neutral lipids, and to lesser extent phospholipids, of larvae reflected {{the composition of the}} algae they were fed. C₂₀ and C₂₂ PUFA were preferentially accumulated, particularly DHA which plays a specific structural role in Pectinids. Growth results suggest increasing dietary ARA, or possibly 22 : 5 n- 6.

30|$|First, the {{majority}} of the algae are unicellular and low in density, making harvesting very expensive (Rawat et al. 2011; Brennan and Owende 2010). Second, several life cycle assessments (LCAs) indicate that various setbacks need to be addressed. An LCA completed by Campbell et al. (2011) found that while biodiesel reduces greenhouse gas emissions when compared with fossil fuel and canola-based biodiesel production of 15  g/m 2  day and 30  g/m 2  day, biodiesel is more expensive than fossil fuel and canola-based fuels (Campbell et al. 2011). Singh and Olsen (2011) concluded that biodiesel production has high electricity costs and water requirements—for every 1  kg of biodiesel produced, 3726  kg of freshwater is required. <b>Algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> also requires a supply of nitrogen, usually from chemical fertilizers (Clarens et al. 2010), phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur (Singh and Olsen 2011). Another LCA finds that when comparing algae, corn, canola, and switchgrass as a potential biofuel, algae have the highest energy production, lowest land requirement, and eutrophication potential, but corn and switchgrass reduce greenhouse gases more efficiently (Clarens et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|Despite these limitations, algae grown {{within the}} pond can be {{harvested}} (converted into biomass) {{for the purpose}} of creating an alternative fuel source, provided that the influent does not contain heavy metals. As a fuel source, algae have many advantages—high productivity, short growth time, low land requirements, and the formation of lipids capable of being converted into fuels (Pittman et al. 2011). Studies show that lipids have a dry weight range between 10 and 30  %, where the values can be contingent on the type of wastewater and its associated concentrations (Pittman et al. 2011; Rawat et al. 2011). <b>Algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> creates biofuels such as gas or oil-based fuels, hydrogen gas (Pittman et al. 2011), ethanol, biogas from methane for electricity (Rawat et al. 2011), and biodiesel, a fuel that is biodegradable, renewable, and low in CO 2 emissions (Brennan and Owende 2010). Depending on the species, the amount of gas production will vary. For example, Chlorella vulgaris has a potential methane production between 0.6 and 0.8  L/g volatile suspended solids (VSS), while Chlorella pyrenoidosa produces 0.8  L/g VSS. Other algae species such as Scenedesmus obliquus ranged from 0.6 to 0.7  L/g VSS (Singh and Olsen 2011).|$|E
40|$|Light {{microscopy}} and deep-etch {{electron microscopy}} {{were used to}} visualize triacylglyceride (TAG) -filled lipid bodies (LBs) of the green eukaryotic soil alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for biodiesel production. Cells growing in nitrogen-replete media contain small cytoplasmic lipid bodies (α-cyto-LBs) and small chloroplast plastoglobules. When starved for N, β-cyto-LB formation is massively stimulated. β-Cyto-LBs are intimately associated with both the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope, suggesting {{a model for the}} active participation of both organelles in β-cyto-LB biosynthesis and packaging. When sta 6 mutant cells, blocked in starch biosynthesis, are N starved, they produce β-cyto-LBs and also chloroplast LBs (cpst-LBs) that are at least 10 times larger than plastoglobules and eventually engorge the chloroplast stroma. Production of β-cyto-LBs and cpst-LBs under the conditions we used is dependent on exogenous 20 mM acetate. We propose that the greater TAG yields reported for N-starved sta 6 cells {{can be attributed to the}} strain's ability to produce cpst-LBs, a capacity that is lost when the mutant is complemented by a STA 6 transgene. Provision of a 20 mM acetate “boost” during N starvation generates sta 6 cells that become so engorged with LBs—at the expense of cytoplasm and most organelles—that they float on water even when centrifuged.

40|$|Microalgae {{separation}} has to {{be undertaken}} in drinking water treatment plants, advanced wastewater treatment plants and in algae harvesting, where algae {{might be used to}} produce biofuel or nutraceuticals. Potential separation processes include centrifugation, membrane filtration, electrophoresis and clarification by either sedimentation or dissolved air flotation (DAF) with coagulation-flocculation as a pretreatment. In water treatment, coagulation-flocculation-flotation is a preferred method as it takes advantage of the natural buoyancy of low density algae; however, rapid and dramatic variations in algal populations mean that preceding coagulation-flocculation can be difficult to optimise, leading to ineffective flotation. DAF is also of interest for <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> for the same reasons, but in this instance, the issue is associated with reducing the cost of separation, as this can reach 20 - 30 % of the total cost of biomass production. The PosiDAF process has been developed to improve process robustness and cost effectiveness. In this novel DAF adaptation, the pretreatment stage has been replaced by polymer dosing direct to the saturator to produce positivelycharged bubbles that will attract and attach to the negatively-charged cells: novel polymers are being developed to enhance these interactions. At pilot scale, it was shown that separation effectiveness was comparable to that of optimised conventional DAF with the added benefits of a reduced footprint, reduced chemical demand (leading to lower chemical concentration in the algal-rich float layer) and an increased solid:liquid ratio of the resultant float which would in turn mean less intensive post-treatment was required, for example prior to conversion to biofuel...|$|E

Separating the algae from the Logan Lagoon wastewater is the most expensive portion of the biodiesel process and the application of chemical flocculation can significantly increase costs and potentially interfere with biodiesel production. Cross flow filtration has been identified for algae harvesting, and experiments were conducted to evaluate materials and operating conditions for separating and harvesting algae from the Logan Lagoon system. Two cross flow filtrations units were used to conduct experiments. A pilot-scale cross flow filtration unit provided by WesTech, Inc., Engineering (Salt Lake City) with a 0. 2 -micron nylon membrane mesh was used for mixed-culture algae harvesting. In addition, a bench scale cross flow filtration unit was provided, and tests were conducted to further examine the effectiveness of cross flow filtration on pure-culture algae harvesting. A 1 -micron nylon, 5 -micron nylon and 5 -micron polyester mesh were used with this system. The WesTech, Inc., Pilot Scale System demonstrated that the type of membrane used was critical for effective algae harvesting. Test results showed that the algal cake that developed on the membrane and that the amount of algae harvested decreased with flux. The bench scale unit demonstrated that more algal cells were collected when a membrane of a larger pore size was used. The 1 -micron nylon mesh proved to be the most effective at concentration algae.

40|$|In the future, {{increased}} demand and rising costs are expected for energy and liquid fuels; meanwhile, {{global climate change}} is attributed to carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel combustion. These challenges may be addressed by lignocellulosic and algal biofuels. Lignocellulosic biomass may be converted to bioethanol via sequential pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification and fermentation, while algal biomass may be converted to biodiesel or possibly gasoline. For lignocellulosic bioethanol, two predominant costs {{are associated with the}} biomass feedstock and the enzyme preparation, and these costs are due, in part, to slow reaction rates as well as poor conversion during the enzymatic saccharification step. Algal biofuels are faced with challenges in large-scale production, harvesting and extraction. In particular, harvesting is {{a significant portion of the}} total production costs due to the microscopic and dilute nature of autotrophically-grown algae. To address poor conversion rates during cellulose saccharification, a battery of experiments was designed to attribute the main inhibition mechanisms as reductions in (1) enzyme activity and (2) substrate reactivity, or (3) an accumulation of inhibitory products in solution. Inhibition mechanisms due to product sugars and reduced substrate reactivity were found to be dominant. Conversion was increased via product-sugar removal via ultrafiltration. To address <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting</b> costs, primary concentration using sedimentation via flocculation or via inclined sedimentation was studied. Additive-free flocculation and sedimentation of algae using naturally-available Mg 2 + present in brackish-water was evaluated in an effort to reduce flocculant costs. An optimum pH was observed at which rapid settling and yet minimal precipitation occurred. Using inclined sedimentation, high-aspect ratio settlers inclined at shallow angles were used to achieve rapid algal clarification, at bulk-average velocities up to 500 times the terminal velocity of single cells. Sludge flow at a particular angle was found to be dependent on sludge mass and adhesion. Negatively-charged, Alconox-treated glass achieved sludge flow at angles as low as 10 ° from horizontal. Alternatively, algae harvest and concentration was demonstrated by a two-step process consisting of a long clarification and deposition step followed by a short sludge resuspension and recovery step. Using this technique, a 0. 7 g/L algal suspension was concentrated to 59 g/L...|$|E
40|$|For Phase 1 of this project, the Hopewell team {{developed}} a detailed {{design for the}} Small Scale Pilot-Scale Algal CO 2 Sequestration System. This pilot consisted of six (6) x 135 gallon cultivation tanks including systems for CO 2 delivery and control, algal cultivation, and <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting.</b> A feed tank supplied Hopewell wastewater to the tanks and a receiver tank collected the effluent from the algal cultivation system. The effect of environmental parameters and nutrient loading on CO 2 uptake and sequestration into biomass were determined. Additionally the cost of capturing CO 2 from an industrial stack emission at both pilot and full-scale was determined. The engineering estimate evaluated Amine Guard technology for capture of pure CO 2 and direct stack gas capture and compression. The study concluded that Amine Guard technology has lower lifecycle cost at commercial scale, although the cost of direct stack gas capture is lower at the pilot scale. Experiments conducted under high concentrations of dissolved CO 2 did not demonstrate enhanced algae growth rate. This result suggests that the dissolved CO 2 concentration at neutral pH was already above the limiting value. Even though dissolved CO 2 did not show {{a positive effect on}} biomass growth, controlling its value at a constant set-point during daylight hours can be beneficial in an algae cultivation stage with high algae biomass concentration to maximize the rate of CO 2 uptake. The limited enhancement of algal growth by CO 2 addition to Hopewell wastewater was due at least in part to the high endogenous CO 2 evolution from bacterial degradation of dissolved organic carbon present at high levels in the wastewater. It was found that the high level of bacterial activity was somewhat inhibitory to algal growth in the Hopewell wastewater. The project demonstrated that the Honeywell automation and control system, in combination with the accuracy of the online pH, dissolved O 2, dissolved CO 2, turbidity, Chlorophyll A and conductivity sensors is suitable for process control of algae cultivation in an open pond systems. This project concluded that the Hopewell wastewater is very suitable for algal cultivation but the potential for significant CO 2 sequestration from the plant stack gas emissions was minimal due to the high endogenous CO 2 generation in the wastewater from the organic wastewater content. Algae cultivation was found to be promising, however, for nitrogen remediation in the Hopewell wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Khartoum's State has two public {{wastewater}} treatment plants, of which only one is purely waste stabilization ponds system, i. e. Soba treatment plant. As most researches have proved, the removal {{rates of the}} plant is no satisfactory, especially coliforms'. However, most of these studies {{are concerned with the}} redesign of the plant or replacing it with a new one, while only a few discuss the factors affecting the treatment process or how to remedy its imperfections. As proper analysis and environmental control can improve almost all wastewater biological treatments; this study basically aims to decide the cause /effect relationship of the removal rates of organic and suspended solid loads {{with some of the most}} important environmental conditions, in addition to major constituents' concentrations in the wastewater. This relation can be used to enhance the removal rates of the ponds' system. As the removal efficiency for suspended solids had dropped to as low as 60 %, while BOD removal stays above 75 % most of the time, compared to the 80 % TSS and 85 % BOD design removal; the treatment is in desperate need for modification. Based on the effluent/ influent concentrations for a period of 73 months' averages, the relation is expressed as statistically derived equations (deterministic model) using multiple regression analysis, while the strength of it is measured using correlation coefficients and ANOVA tables technique. After eliminating outlier points, the model was drawn with ± 95 % confidence interval to check its reliability. For further confirmation of the soundness of the stochastic model, it was converted into a mechanistic /phenomenological model using Thirumurthi graphical solution of the well known Wehner & Wilhem equation. The resulting model was compared with the old model and the results were satisfactory in accordance to approach and precision. After the compatibility of the two models is proved, it can be used to improve the performance of the plant by controlling the predominating factors on the treatment to improve the effluent's quality, in addition to improving design of similar plants making use of current experience. As sun shine, dissolved oxygen, pH level, and temperature are the factors with the higher correlation, and consequently having more influence on the quality than the rest of smaller correlation; they can be controlled to v achieve the maximum possible efficiency of the plant using simple inexpensive methods i. e. scum removal, equalization tanks, <b>algal</b> <b>harvesting,</b> etc. As the simplicity and inexpensiveness of stabilization ponds technique is well known, the remediation and quality enhancement has been proven to be no exception. However, researches and experimental work is of major importance in order to find the extent of improvement achieved from the recommended alterations...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the performance of mixed microalgal bioreactors in treating three different types of wastewaters – kitchen wastewater (KWW), palm oil mill effluent (POME), and pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) in semi-continuous mode and to analyze the lipid content in the <b>harvested</b> <b>algal</b> biomass. The reactors were monitored for total nitrogen and phosphate removal at eight solid retention times (SRTs) - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 days. The nutrient uptake kinetic parameters were quantified using linearized Michaelis-Menten and Monod models at steady-state conditions. The nutrient removal efficiency and lipid production were found to be higher in KWW when compared with the other wastewaters. Saturated fatty acids (C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0, and C 18 : 1) accounted for more than 60 % of the algal fatty acids for all the wastewaters. The lipid is, therefore, considered suitable for synthesizing biodiesel...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{consumption}} of high pressure homogenisation (HPH) was analysed {{to determine the}} feasibility of rupturing algal cells for biodiesel production. Experimentally, the processing capacity (i. e. flow rate), power draw and cell disruption efficiency of HPH were independent of feed concentration (for Nannochloropsis sp. up to 25 % w/w solids). Depending on the homogenisation pressure (60 - 150 MPa), the solids concentration (0. 25 - 25 % w/w), and triacylglyceride (TAG) content of the <b>harvested</b> <b>algal</b> biomass (10 - 30 %), the energy consumed by HPH represented between 6 % and 110 -times the energy density of the resulting biodiesel. Provided the right species (weak cell wall and high TAG content) is selected and the biomass is processed at a sufficiently high solids concentration, HPH can consume {{a small fraction of}} the energy content of the biodiesel produced. This study demonstrates the feasibility of process-scale algal cell disruption by HPH based on its energy requirement. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
