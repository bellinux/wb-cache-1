The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

5000|$|The {{comedy in}} The Magic Flute is {{retained}} faithfully in the film. As in the opera, the beautiful young Papagena {{pretends to be}} an old woman as part of one of the tests that Papageno must undergo before winning her and, again as in the original work, the film audience sees her only as an old woman until near the end (except in <b>a</b> <b>two-paged</b> spread that Papageno reads). However, because this is possible on film, the old Papagena is played by a genuine elderly woman (Liz Smith in a non-singing role), not by soprano Silvia Moi, who plays the young Papagena, while in stage versions of the opera, both characters are always played by the same singer, who, as the old woman, either covers her face and speaks with a cackle, or dons an [...] "old woman" [...] mask which she conveniently throws off when she turns into the young version of herself.|$|R
