The subledger shows detail {{for part of the}} accounting records such as property <b>and</b> equipment, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> etc. The detail would include such items as date the item was purchased or expense incurred, a description of the item, the original balance, and the net book value.

50|$|During {{the years}} 1974 through 1979, taxpayers <b>prepaid</b> certain {{business}} <b>expenses</b> each December {{that were not}} due until February and March of the following year.

50|$|Adjusting {{entries for}} {{prepayments}} {{are necessary to}} account for cash that has been received prior to delivery of goods or completion of services.

50|$|In accounting, {{a current}} asset is any asset which can {{reasonably}} {{be expected to}} be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year or operating cycle (whichever period is longer). Typical current assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments (marketable securities), accounts receivable, stock inventory, supplies, and the portion of prepaid liabilities, sometimes referred to as <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> which will be paid within a year.|$|R
5000|$|Deferred expense: cash {{has left}} the company, but the event has not {{actually}} occurred yet. <b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> {{are the most common}} type. For instance, a company may purchase a year of insurance. After six months, only half of the insurance will have been 'used' with another six months of the insurance still owed to the company. Thus, the company records half of the payment as an outflow (an expense) and the other half as a receivable from the insurance company (an asset).|$|R
5000|$|Nonrefundable {{security}} deposits: Deferred by the lessor as unearned revenue; Capitalized by the lessee as a <b>prepaid</b> rent <b>expense</b> {{until the}} lessor considers the deposit earned.|$|R
50|$|If no cause-and-effect {{relationship}} exists (e.g., a sale is impossible), {{costs are}} recognized as expenses in the accounting period they expired: i.e., when have been used up or consumed (e.g., of spoiled, dated, or substandard goods, or not demanded services). <b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> are not recognized as expenses, but as assets until one of the qualifying conditions is met resulting in a recognition as expenses. Lastly, if no connection with revenues can be established, costs are recognized immediately as expenses (e.g., general administrative and research and development costs).|$|R
50|$|For example, {{when the}} {{accounting}} periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid insurance cost {{is added to}} <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an expense, rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as prepayments (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between investment <b>and</b> <b>accruals</b> to disentangle earning-fixation hypothesis. We decompose total accruals into working capital <b>accruals,</b> long-term investment <b>and</b> non-transaction <b>accruals</b> to test whether the investment can explain the <b>accruals</b> anomalies <b>and</b> behavior in operating and investment cycle. We use the financial information of 135 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) from 2005 to 2011 through OLS approach and find that long-term investment <b>and</b> non-transaction <b>accruals</b> are able to predict subsequent net income and free cash flow. Whereas, working capital accruals do not have this ability. To predict subsequent ROA, the persistence of total <b>accruals,</b> Long-term investment <b>and</b> external financing decrease in longer operating cycle. Total accruals are more persistent <b>and</b> non-transaction <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> external financing are less persistent in the longer investment cycle. Total <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> external financing are inversely related to subsequent returns, implying that accruals anomalies as well as external financing anomalies exist in our sample. To predict future returns, the persistence of total <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> working capital <b>accruals</b> decrease, however, the persistence of external financing <b>and</b> non-transaction <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> long-term investment increase in longer operating cycle. Total <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> non-transaction <b>accruals</b> are more persistent <b>and</b> working capital <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> long-term investment are les...|$|R
50|$|Deferred charge (or deferral) is {{cost that}} is accounted-for in latter {{accounting}} period for its anticipated future benefit, or {{to comply with}} the requirement of matching costs with revenues. Deferred charges include costs of starting up, obtaining long-term debt, advertising campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current asset on the balance sheet pending amortization. Deferred charges often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial ratios are based on the total assets excluding deferred charges since they have no physical substance (cash realization) and cannot be used in reducing total liabilities.|$|R

30|$|However, we {{additionally}} {{test whether}} our results are robust by eliminating provisions from total <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> assuming that all provisions are non-current liabilities. We run this analysis {{only for the}} first and second financial reporting properties (absolute discretionary <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> correlation between <b>accruals</b> <b>and</b> operating cash flow) since provisions are not important in testing the persistence of earnings and the predictability of earnings. The results are consistent with the main analysis.|$|R
50|$|An advance payment, {{or simply}} an advance, {{is the part}} of a contractually due sum that is paid or {{received}} in advance for goods or services, while the balance included in the invoice will only follow the delivery. It is called a <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense</b> in accrual accounting for the entity issuing the advance. Advanced payments are recorded as assets on the balance sheet. As these assets are used they are expended and recorded on the income statement for the period in which they are incurred. Insurance is a common prepaid asset, which will only be a prepaid asset because it is a proactive measure to protect business from unforeseen events.|$|R

40|$|Earnings {{management}} {{arises from}} a conflicting goal between agents and principals which basically means as managers’ intentions to manipulate accounting {{figures in the}} financial statement to achieve their own interests.

The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of cost of earnings management on <b>accrual</b> <b>and</b> real earnings management and the trade-off relationship between <b>accrual</b> <b>and</b> real earnings management. Using 14 publicly listed banks in the Indonesia Stock Exchange during period 2009 - 2013, this study shows that costs of <b>accrual</b> <b>and</b> real earnings management have significant effects on <b>accrual</b> <b>and</b> real earnings management. However, this study did not find the evidence that there is a trade-off relationship between <b>accrual</b> earnings management <b>and</b> real earnings management. The findings have implications regarding the use of costs of earnings management in considering type of earnings management’s decision in publicly listed banks in Indonesia...|$|R
