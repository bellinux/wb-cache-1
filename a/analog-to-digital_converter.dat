25|$|Like {{the video}} camera, most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that is, {{they have a}} characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide {{a certain number of}} samples (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converter,</b> which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.|$|E

25|$|The {{availability}} of inexpensive {{digital signal processing}} electronics in the late 1970s and 1980s {{led to the development}} of the first digital delay effects. Initially, they were only available in expensive rack-mounted units but eventually as costs came down and the electronics grew smaller, they became available in the form of foot pedals. The first digital delay offered in a pedal was the Boss DD-2 in 1984. Rack-mounted delay units evolved into digital reverb units and on to digital multi-effects units capable of more sophisticated effects than pure delay, such as reverb and Audio timescale-pitch modification effects. Digital delay systems function by sampling the input signal through an <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converter,</b> after which the signal is passed through a series of digital signal processors that record it into a storage buffer, and then play back the stored audio based on parameters set by the user. The delayed ("wet") output may be mixed with the unmodified ("dry") signal after, or before, it is sent to a digital-to-analog converter for output.|$|E

The real-time operating system was written by John Neblett, and was the intellectual precursor of the RSX-11 operating system for the PDP-11.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{electrode}} {{is connected}} to one input of a differential amplifier (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a common system reference electrode {{is connected to}} the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000–100,000 times, or 60–100 dB of voltage gain). In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converter,</b> after being passed through an anti-aliasing filter. [...] Analog-to-digital sampling typically occurs at 256–512Hz in clinical scalp EEG; sampling rates of up to 20kHz are used in some research applications.|$|E

50|$|<b>Analog-to-digital</b> <b>converters</b> are {{integral}} to 2000s era music reproduction technology and digital audio workstation-based sound recording. People often produce music on computers using an analog recording and therefore need <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converters</b> {{to create the}} pulse-code modulation (PCM) data streams that go onto compact discs and digital music files. The current crop of <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converters</b> utilized in music can sample at rates up to 192 kilohertz. Considerable literature exists on these matters, but commercial considerations often play a significant role. Many recording studios record in 24-bit/96 kHz (or higher) pulse-code modulation (PCM) or Direct Stream Digital (DSD) formats, and then downsample or decimate the signal for Red-Book CD production (44.1 kHz) or to 48 kHz for commonly used radio and television broadcast applications.|$|R
2500|$|The MEMS (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) {{microphone}} is {{also called}} a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched {{directly into a}} silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converter</b> (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic, InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices [...] ), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles [...] ), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies, and Omron.|$|E
2500|$|The {{voltage pulse}} {{produced}} by the detector (or by the photomultiplier in a scintillation counter) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small voltage signal {{produced by the}} detector, reshapes it into a Gaussian or trapezoidal shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the analog-to-digital conversion is performed before the peak is reshaped. The <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converter</b> (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of [...] "bins" [...] into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the channels in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on {{the resolution of the}} system and the energy range being studied.|$|E
2500|$|The C64 {{retained}} the DE-9 joystick Atari joystick port from the VIC-20 and added another; any Atari specification game controller {{can be used}} on a C64. [...] The joysticks are read from the registers at $DC00 and $DC01, and most software is designed to use a joystick in port 2 for control rather than port 1, as the upper bits of $DC00 are used by the keyboard and an I/O conflict can result. [...] Although it is possible to use Sega gamepads on a C64, it is not recommended as the slightly different signal generated by them can damage the CIA chip. [...] The Start button on Sega Genesis controllers outputs a −5V signal; and the other buttons also pull the lines on the CIA low, which is different from the behavior of Atari spec controllers. Register $D419 is used to control paddles and is an analog input. Atari paddles are electrically compatible with the C64, but have different resistance values than Commodore's paddles, which means most software will not work properly with them. [...] However, only a handful of games, mostly ones released early in the computer's life cycle, can use paddles. In 1986, Commodore released two mice for the C64 and C128, the 1350 and 1351. The 1350 is a digital device, read from the joystick registers (and can be used with any program supporting joystick input); while the 1351 is a true mouse, read with the SID's <b>analog-to-digital</b> <b>converter.</b>|$|E
