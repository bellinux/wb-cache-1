25|$|The Harry Potter series shares many {{similarities}} with George Lucas's Star Wars {{with respect}} to main characters, especially heroes and villains, as well as story plotlines. Scholar Deborah Cartmell states that Harry Potters story is based as much on Star Wars <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> any other text.|$|E
25|$|Water absorbs {{light of}} long {{wavelengths}}, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back {{to reach the}} eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light {{they are capable of}} absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.|$|E

25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{that made}} her significant {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
25|$|Norfolk Island Hospital is {{the only}} medical centre on the island. From 1 July 2016, medical {{treatment}} on Norfolk Island is covered by Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> mainland Australia. Emergency medical treatment is covered by Medicare or a private health insurer. Although the hospital can perform minor surgery, serious medical conditions {{are not permitted to}} be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia. Air charter transport can cost in the order of A$30,000, which is covered by the Australian Government. For serious emergencies, medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force. The island has one ambulance, staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{building}} of Tilbury Docks {{on the opposite side}} of the river, between 1882 and 1886, Gravesend was the Thames' first port of entry. Thousands of emigrants, as well as large numbers of troops, embarked from here. Tilbury Docks have expanded considerably since with the closure of all the London Docks. The entrance to the Docks is somewhat awkward, situated <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the sharp bend of the river, and often need tugboat assistance, as do the larger ships moored at Tilbury landing stages. There have been many tug companies based at Gravesend: among them the Sun Company, the Alexandra Towing Company and, today, the Smith Howard Towing Company. East Indiamen traditionally stopped here at a point known as Long Reach to lighten their loads before sailing up the Thames to moorings at Blackwall.|$|E
50|$|A further {{development}} of the Panzer IV series also by Krupp. It used leaf spring suspension, the HL 116 engine and the motor compartment of the VK 20.01(III). Maximum speed was to be 42 km/h, same <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the Panzer IV Ausf. C. This was later redesignated as the VK 20.01(BW) and then as the B.W.40.|$|R

50|$|Aḥmad Ghazālī’s thought, {{centered}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> {{the idea}} of love, left a profound mark {{on the development of}} Persian mystical literature, especially poetry celebrating love. Many of the topoi (maẓāmīn) used by later poets such as ʿAṭṭār, Saʿdī, ʿIrāqī, and Ḥāfeẓ, to name but a few, can be traced to his works, particularly the Sawāneḥ.|$|R

500|$|Between {{locations}} in the Solar System, the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly. Where {{the major source of}} argon is the decay of [...] in rocks, [...] will be the dominant isotope, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> Earth. Argon produced directly by stellar nucleosynthesis, is dominated by the alpha-process nuclide [...] Correspondingly, solar argon contains 84.6% [...] (according to solar wind measurements), and the ratio of the three isotopes 36Ar:38Ar:40Ar in the atmospheres of the outer planets is 8400:1600:1. This contrasts with the low abundance of primordial [...] in Earth's atmosphere, which is only 31.5 ppmv (= 9340 ppmv × 0.337%), comparable with that of neon (18.18 ppmv) on Earth and with interplanetary gasses, measured by probes.|$|E
500|$|The {{temperature}} of outer space {{is measured in}} terms of the kinetic activity of the gas, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic {{temperature of}} the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the Big Bang, which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background.) The current black body temperature of the background radiation is about [...] The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the corona of the Sun has temperatures which range over 1.2–2.6millionK.|$|E

The Blu-ray edition of the video album is presented in an aspect ratio of , encoded with MPEG-4 AVC and grants a 1080i transfer. Good Girl Gone Bad Live contains two audio tracks DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and LPCM 2.0. According to a reviewer of Blu-ray.com the LPCM 2.0 is very strong, {{but it is not}} as convincing as the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.

500|$|If {{volcanism}} on Titan really exists, {{the hypothesis}} {{is that it is}} driven by energy released from the decay of radioactive elements within the mantle, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> Earth. Magma on Earth is made of liquid rock, which is less dense than the solid rocky crust through which it erupts. Because ice is less dense than water, Titan's watery magma would be denser than its solid icy crust. This means that cryovolcanism on Titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate, possibly via tidal flexing from nearby Saturn. [...] The low-pressure ice, overlaying a liquid layer of ammonium sulfate, ascends buoyantly, and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events. Titan is resurfaced through the process by grain-sized ice and ammonium sulfate ash, which helps produce a wind-shaped landscape and sand dune features.|$|E
500|$|Thomas's verbal style {{played against}} strict verse forms, {{such as in}} the villanelle [...] "Do not go gentle into that good night". His images were {{carefully}} ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas {{wrote in a letter to}} Glyn Jones: [...] "My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>on</b> a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy".|$|E

Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known <b>as</b> virga. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> theorized that early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented it from being trapped into solid compounds <b>on</b> the surface <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the Earth.|$|R
