Serotonin concentrations in platelet-rich plasma and platelet-poor plasma as well as urinary 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) and serotonin levels were measured during the full length of the courses. By means of comparison with the <b>antiemetic</b> <b>agent</b> chlorpromazine, used on day I of the first course only, the effect of the serotonin type- 3 antagonist tropisetron, the <b>antiemetic</b> <b>agent</b> used {{during the rest of the}} courses, on these parameters was studied. Clinical effects were also recorded. No change in the parameters of serotonin metabolism could be demonstrated during either course by the serotonin type- 3 antagonist tropisetron. Also in vitro, no effect of tropisetron on the active serotonin uptake by platelets was found. Serotonin levels in platelets showed no correlation with emetic response. However, the platelet serotonin content decreased significantly between the first and the second course (P < 0. 01). The significant reduction in platelet serotonin content observed between the first and the second course indicates a depletion of total body serotonin.

30|$|Detection and {{exclusion}} of duplicate data {{is an important}} step in conducting a meta-analysis. Our study found an increase in the mean effect size and fail-safe number with duplicated data. This finding means that the effect and reliability was overestimated in a meta-analysis. Multiple publication bias may be an important threat to the validity of meta-analyses. Most importantly, studies with significant results are more likely to lead to multiple publications and presentations (Easterbrook et al. 1991), which makes it more likely that they will be located and included in a meta-analysis. For instance, Tramer et al. (1997) concluded that the inclusion of redundant data in a meta-analysis led to a 23 % overestimation of the treatment effectiveness of an <b>antiemetic</b> <b>agent.</b> Murphy and Wyllie (2009) reported that removing the overlapping case would decrease the sample size by 20 % in a meta-analysis that quantified the association between initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and increased mortality in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.|$|E

In almost all patients, these data evaluated the degree of agreement before and after the start of chemotherapy, and this timing is often defined as the acute phase in clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of <b>antiemetic</b> <b>agents.</b> A recent study in a Japanese population showed that the Complete Response (no vomiting/retching and no rescue medication) and Complete Control (no vomiting/retching, no rescue medication, and no more than mild nausea) of nausea and vomiting in the acute phase of highly emetogenic chemotherapy is approximately 75 to 90 %, and the Total Control (no vomiting/retching, no rescue medication, and no nausea) is between 80 and 87 % [35 – 37].
