In the steady state, the electrical torque is equal to the mechanical torque and hence the accelerating power is zero. During this period the rotor moves at synchronous speed ωs in rad/s. The electric torque Te corresponds to the net air-gap power in the machine and thus accounts for the total output power of the generator plus I2R losses in the armature winding.|$|E
5000|$|The aeolipile {{consists}} of a vessel, usually a [...] "simple" [...] solid of revolution, such as a sphere or a cylinder, arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved nozzles projecting from it (tipjets). When the vessel is pressurised with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the rocket principle {{as a consequence of}} the 2nd and 3rd of Newton's laws of motion. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the bearings, the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical couple), or torque, causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed (rpm) and consume the <b>accelerating</b> <b>torque,</b> eventually cancelling it and achieving a steady state speed.|$|E

40|$|In a {{synchronous}} machine, radial, tangential, and {{axial forces}} are generated. In this thesis, three different technologies {{to control them}} are proposed. The first one, involves the utilization of the radial forces that arise between the rotor and the stator. This is achieved by segmenting the rotor field winding into groups of poles and controlling their corresponding magnetization individually. This technology is particularly useful to achieve magnetic balance and to create controllable radial forces. The second technology, involves {{the control of the}} rotor field in order to influence the tangential forces that produce torque. This is achieved by inverting the rotor field winding polarity with respect to the stator field. With this technique, breaking and <b>accelerating</b> <b>torques</b> can be created. It is particularly useful to start a synchronous machine. Finally, the application of axial forces with a magnetic thrust bearing is discussed. The main benefits of this technology are higher efficiency and increased reliability.

30|$|When {{the vehicle}} reached the water surface, the fluid torque {{influenced}} {{the motion of}} vehicle and increased with high initial angle of attack. As the vehicle entered water, the buoyancy and buoyancy center changed. The misalignment between center-of-gravity position and buoyant center resulted to another torque. Both torques were affected simultaneously. When α <  0 °, the initial angle of attack and fluid torque were both negative. The vehicle began to rotate downwards. The increase of slope angle caused the negative increase of the angle of attack and rotational angular velocity. Both <b>torques</b> <b>accelerated</b> the change of angle of attack and slope angle when the vehicle entered the water completely. The overturn occurred downwards when the slope angle exceeded the threshold. When α ≥  0 °, the initial angle of attack and fluid torque were both positive. The vehicle began to rotate upwards. The decrease of slope angle caused the positive increase of the angle of attack and rotational angular velocity. Both <b>torques</b> <b>accelerated</b> the change of angle of attack and slope angle when the vehicle entered the water completely. The overturn occurred upwards when the slope angle exceeded the threshold. Choosing the proper water-entry angle of attack is important to avoid the overturn phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{insights}} from the density functional theory have been enormously {{powerful in the}} fields of physics, chemistry and biology. A natural outcome is the concept of “energy density” as has been developed recently: drop region, spindle structure, interaction energy density. Under external source of electromagnetic fields, charged particles can be accelerated by Lorentz force. Dissipative force can make the state of the charged particles stationary. In quantum mechanics, the energy eigenstate is another rule of the stationary state. Tension density of quantum field theory has been formulated {{in such a way that}} it can compensate the Lorentz force density at any point of space–time. This formulation can give mechanical description of local equilibrium leading to the quantum mechanical stationary state. The tension density is given by the divergence of stress tensor density. Electronic spin can be <b>accelerated</b> by <b>torque</b> density derived from the stress tensor density.

50|$|The Sidewinder and to {{an extent}} the Anglewinder {{configurations}} are often seen as superior for slot racing cars. This is because when <b>accelerating,</b> the reverse <b>torque</b> of the motor transfers weight {{to the front of}} the vehicle and therefore the guide that keeps it on the track. This allows the slot racer to accelerate through corners. There is also a further advantage as, if dynamic braking is used, the reverse torque of the motor then transfers weight to the rear wheels which invariably are the dominant grip wheels on a slot car. Conversely the reverse torque effect on in line motor configurations transfers weight from side to side and destabilises the car.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model of near-Earth {{asteroid}} (NEA) rotational fission and ensuing dynamics that describes the creation of synchronous binaries and all other observed NEA systems including: doubly synchronous binaries, high- e binaries, ternary systems, and contact binaries. Our model only presupposes the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, "rubble pile" asteroid geophysics, and gravitational interactions. The YORP effect torques a "rubble pile" asteroid until the asteroid reaches its fission spin limit and the components enter orbit about each other (Scheeres, D. J. [2007]. Icarus 189, 370 - 385). Non-spherical gravitational potentials couple the spin states to the orbit state and chaotically drive the system towards the observed asteroid classes along two evolutionary tracks primarily distinguished by mass ratio. Related to {{this is a new}} binary process termed secondary fission - the secondary asteroid of the binary system is rotationally <b>accelerated</b> via gravitational <b>torques</b> until it fissions, thus creating a chaotic ternary system. The initially chaotic binary can be stabilized to create a synchronous binary by components of the fissioned secondary asteroid impacting the primary asteroid, solar gravitational perturbations, and mutual body tides. These results emphasize the importance of the initial component size distribution and configuration within the parent asteroid. NEAs may go through multiple binary cycles and many YORP-induced rotational fissions during their approximately 10 Myr lifetime in the inner Solar System. Rotational fission and the ensuing dynamics are responsible for all NEA systems including the most commonly observed synchronous binaries. Comment: 39 pages, 19 figure...|$|R

We investigate the effects of the resonant Compton scattering by the charge carriers (both electrons and ions) on the emergent X-ray spectra and pulse profiles. 1. Nature of the AXPs and SGRs The Anomalous X-ray Pulsars and Soft Gamma Repeaters are neutron stars which share similar spin periods, P = 5 − − 12 s, characteristic ages, P / ˙ P = 3 × 10 3 − 4 × 10 5 yr, and X-ray luminosities, LX = 3 × 10 34 − 10 36 erg s − 1, well in excess of the spin-down luminosities (Thompson et al. 2001). They are almost certainly young and isolated: no evidence for a binary stellar companion has yet been detected in any of these sources, and a few are convincingly associated with young supernova remnants. The overlap between the SGR and AXP sources in a three-dimensional parameter space (P, ˙ P and LX), and the observed variabil-...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the physical {{implications of the}} rapid spindown of Soft Gamma Repeater 1900 + 14, and of the apparent "braking glitch", Δ P/P = l x 10 ^- 4, that was concurrent with the Aug. 27 th giant flare. A radiation-hydrodynamical outflow associated with the flare could impart the required torque, {{but only if the}} dipole magnetic field is stronger than 10 ^ 14 G and the outflow lasts longer and/or is more energetic than the observed X-ray flare. A positive period increment is also a natural consequence of a gradual, plastic deformation of the neutron star crust by an intense magnetic field, which forces the neutron superfluid to rotate more slowly than the crust. Sudden unpinning of the neutron vortex lines during the August 27 th event would then induce a glitch opposite in sign to those observed in young pulsars, but of a much larger magnitude {{as a result of the}} slower rotation. The change in the persistent X-ray lightcurve following the August 27 event is ascribed to continued particle heating in the active region of that outburst. The enhanced X-ray output can be powered by a steady current flowing through the magnetosphere, induced by the twisting motion of the crust. The long term rate of spindown appears to be accelerated with respect to a simple magnetic dipole <b>torque.</b> <b>Accelerated</b> spindown of a seismically-active magnetar will occur when its persistent output of Alfven waves and particles exceeds its spindown luminosity. We suggest that SGRs experience some episodes of relative inactivity, with diminished spindown rates, and that such inactive magnetars are observed as Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). The rapid reappearence of persistent X-ray emission following August 27 flare gives evidence against accretion-powered models. Comment: 24 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechatronic}} {{system is}} one in which mechanical, electrical and intelligent computer control are integrated. Two mechatronic systems were used in this thesis. One was a four axis industrial robot and the other a grinding machine. Friction exist in almost mechanisms with moving parts and depending on the arrangement of the mechanical components may have a significant influence on the mechatronic system 2 ̆ 7 s overall performance. Both the mechatronic systems used in this thesis have large friction components. An understanding of friction and subsequent application of this understanding has been used in force estimation and control schemes and to develop control schemes that lead to improved low speed position tracking. At low velocities friction has highly non-linear characteristics. In many instances the friction at rest (the static friction) is higher than the friction when the mechanism moving at low velocities. This in many mechanical systems leads to a phenomena referred to as 2 ̆ 2 stick slip 2 ̆ 2. Stick slip is a periodic cycle of alternating motion and which limits the velocity and position accuracy of many machines. An impulsive control scheme for low velocity position tracking which reduces the stick slip limit cycle was developed in this thesis. A force control scheme in which the applied force is estimated from servo motor information was also developed. The torque applied by the motor is made up of the <b>torque</b> <b>accelerating</b> the mechanical components, the torque required to overcome friction and the torque required to overcome an external force. For many mechanisms the largest force that the motor has to overcome is the friction component. Therefore accurate friction models of the mechanical system were used to extract the required information about the external force from the motor torque signals. The friction models used here include viscous, coulomb and position dependent friction components. The force estimation and control techniques developed were applied to the grinding process. A series of experiments were conducted in which grinding forces were calculated from servo motor information and a control scheme to control grinding forces without using force sensors was implemented...|$|R
40|$|The WaveGyro – A new Concept for Ocean Wave Energy Capture (Master Thesis by Gebhard Waizmann, University of Southampton 22. 09. 2011) Abstract Climate change, {{environmental}} pollution and the proceeding resource depletion give {{awareness of the}} necessity towards more sustainable energy economics. Energy from ocean waves may once play a contributing role towards this step but is as yet in its fledgling stages. This is mainly due to the harsh sea environment, which implies the need for simple and robust wave energy converter. The work presented in this thesis picks up this thought when dealing with the so-called WaveGyro. Introductory chapters explain how this novel concept arose, followed by a detailed explanation of the working principle. The WavGyro utilizes gyroscopes to provide an internal reaction moment against the wave excitation. This internal reaction permits designing a completely enclosed and thus environmentally resistant device. The gyroscopic precession is used to convert the wave-induced moment into a moment that accelerates the flywheels. Equations of motion, which describe the gyroscope kinetics, are deduced. The gyroscopic motions and moment is then implemented into the first-order wave hydrodynamics. Two main approaches to describe the wave excitation are presented. The first approach is superposition of radiation and exci-tation and the second approach makes use of the relative motion principle, which relates the excitation {{to the extent of}} displacement. Both approaches are employed to deduce the maximum power capture condition in relation to the device’s dimensions and operational parameters. The influence of real sea state, analytically expressed by the Pierson-Moskowitz spec-trum, on the optimum power analysis is considered and implementation methods are de-veloped. Subsequently the spin-up mechanism is explained and examined; this is the mechanism converting the precession moment into <b>torque</b> <b>accelerating</b> the flywheel. It is shown that a simple configuration, composed of an ordinary cogwheel and a sprag-clutch only is not sufficient for this mechanism. Ideas for alternative mechanisms are considered but require further investigation to allow conclusive results. Finally, an approximate plan for the design of model is developed, which includes basic considerations of scaling laws. Recommendations for further theoretical and practical work on the WaveGyro are provided...|$|R
