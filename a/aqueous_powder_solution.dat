The specific surface area of prepared activated carbon {{was found to be}} 1898 m 2 g− 1. Batch adsorption studies reveal that the prepared activated charcoal has a significant capacity for adsorption of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms investigated in this study include Langmuir and Freundlich at 300 K. The Cr(VI) adsorption was found to be maximum (> 95. 0 %) at pH 1. 8. Very small amount of adsorbent activated carbon (1. 25 gL− 1) could remove > 95. 0 % Cr(VI) from aqueous solution of initial concentration 75 mgL− 1. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) adsorption on activated carbon was found to be 151. 51 mgg− 1. The dimensionless separation factor (RL) signifies a favorable adsorption of Cr(VI) on activated charcoal. Adsorption kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto activated carbon was pseudo-second order chemisorptions and follows film-diffusion as well as intra-particle pore-diffusion mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric plasma {{spraying}} (APS) {{has been proved}} useful in obtaining TiO 2 coatings with effective photocatalytic activity. However, the influence of feedstock characteristics on photocatalytic activity has hardly been addressed. This study was undertaken to prepare TiO 2 photocatalytic coatings by APS from different feedstocks. The feedstocks were obtained by spray drying suspensions of a nano- and a submicron-sized TiO 2 powder, with different solids contents and/or ratios of the nano- to submicron-sized particles. All the resulting powders were fully characterised to assess their suitability for use in APS processes. Feedstock powders were then deposited on steel coupons by APS using hydrogen or helium as secondary plasma gas. Coating microstructure and phase composition were characterised. Coating photocatalytic activity was determined by measuring the degradation of methylene blue dye in an <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution.</b> <b>Powder</b> characterisation showed that all feedstocks met plasma spray operation requirements with regard to agglomerate size distribution and density, {{as well as to}} powder flowability. Optimum agglomerate density was obtained when a well-balanced mixture of nano- and submicron-sized particles was used. All coatings displayed a bimodal microstructure with partially melted agglomerates that retained the initial nano- or submicron-sized structure and composition (anatase phase) of the feedstock, surrounded by a fully melted matrix mainly formed by rutile. As expected, coating porosity as well as the amount of partially melted areas depended strongly on plasma spray conditions and on feedstock characteristics. With regard to photocatalytic activity, a reasonably good fit of a first-order kinetic model to the experimental data was found for all coatings. The kinetic constants obtained displayed higher values than those of a commercial sol–gel coating. The values of these constants were related to feedstock characteristics as well as to {{plasma spraying}} conditions on the basis of anatase content. The contribution of other factors to the resulting coating surface is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} was to explore the {{potential}} of supercritical fluid (SF) techniques {{in the field of}} drug delivery. In particular, the relatively recently developed solution-enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDS) technology has been employed in the preparation of particles/powders. The manufacturing, stability and bioavailability of a dosage form strongly depend on the physicochemical properties of the formulation particles. For example, dry powder inhalation (DPI) for administering drugs to the respiratory tract require particles in a narrow size range (1 - 5 μm) to be effective. The identification of polymorphs and control of purity are also important issues since the physicochemical properties and therapeutic effects of the alternative forms of a drug may differ substantially. Solvent-based traditional crystallisation processes provide the product that may require further down-stream processing to obtain particles for advanced drug delivery applications. This can result in unwanted changes in the physicochemical properties of the particles and thus affect the performance of the dosage form. SF processing has addressed many of the challenges in particle formation research. Among several SF technologies developed for particle processing over the last decade, the SEDS process with its specially designed co-axial nozzle with mixing chamber has resulted in improved control over the particle formation process. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) was used as the SF, because it has low critical points and is non-toxic, non-flammable and relatively inexpensive. The initial part of the thesis concerns the formation of particles of model drugs such as hydrocortisone, budesonide and flunisolide using SEDS technology and the determination of the influence of processing conditions and solvents on particle characteristics such as size, shape and crystal structure. Particles of model drugs of differing shapes in a size range suitable for inhalation delivery were prepared. In the process, two new polymorphic forms of flunisolide were identified. This was the first report of SEDS technology being shown as a polymorph-screening tool. The remainder of the thesis deals with the development of SEDS technology for precipitating therapeutic proteins such as recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) from <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions.</b> <b>Powders</b> of hGH were precipitated using SEDS without significant changes in the chemical or physical stability of the protein. The addition of sucrose to hGH in the feed solution promoted precipitation and minimised the detrimental effects of the solvent and/or the process on the physical aggregation of the protein. In conclusion, this thesis highlights the applicability of the SEDS process in drug delivery research and advances general understanding of the particle formation phenomenon. The SEDS process may also prove to be a potential alternative technology for the precipitation of stable powders of therapeutic proteins...|$|R
