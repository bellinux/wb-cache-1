5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{congregation}} are disputed; its establishment in 1885 {{may have been a}} re-organization of a congregation founded in 1860.

There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot.

During the 1930s, there were 30 pubs and it attracted such performers as Charlie Chaplin to the New Palace Theatre. It is now the late-night hub of Plymouth's entertainment strip, but has a reputation for trouble at closing hours.|$|E

From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E
