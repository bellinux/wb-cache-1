She also made periodic trips back to Auburn, to visit her family <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> her parents. The Confederacy surrendered in April 1865; after donating several more months of service, Tubman headed home to Auburn, New York.|$|E

From then on, the Trust let the house to a variety of tenants, including the garden designer and writer Penelope Hobhouse and her husband Prof John Malins from 1980 to 1993.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E

5|$|Mourning doves {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Other {{elements}} of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.|$|E
5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do {{the king and queen}} have their doubles within the painting, in the dimly lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E

5|$|Black {{honeyeaters}} feed on nectar, {{and have}} a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers {{such as those of}} the emu bush. They also take insects on the wing, and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E

Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered severe depression. Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and after meeting with her Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.|$|E

The 2014 Cowdenbeath by-election was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie. The campaign was fought on issues such as education, employment <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the elderly, and saw Labour increase their share of the vote, with an 11.25 percent swing from the SNP and a majority of 5,488.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while {{breeding}} and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. Two clutches {{of five or six}} eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> their eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|On December 16, 1902, Sebree {{was granted}} {{a leave of absence}} to return to the United States <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> his wife who had been badly hurt in a fall. In his place, Lieutenant Commander Henry Minett, Sebree's {{executive}} officer, was made acting commandant of the station and therefore acting governor of the territory. He was also given command of the Wheeling. Captain Edmund Beardsley Underwood was selected as Sebree's replacement, but that decision was not made official immediately, and Underwood remained in Washington to consult with Sebree and President Roosevelt on the governance of the territory. Underwood's selection was not announced until May 1903.|$|E

Non-profit art galleries and university art galleries are also included, but museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., virtual museums) are not.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} two major factions within it – the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel, {{both of whom}} differ to their {{counterparts}} in the west. While the Enclave is similar in goal to their western brethren, the eastern branch of the Brotherhood of Steel seeks to assist the people of the wasteland, though a small group rejected this and became outcasts who seek to resume their original goal of salvaging high-level technology. Other factions include a small group of former slaves who seek to inspire others for freedom by restoring the Lincoln Memorial, a group of wastelanders that feast on blood, and a group who tend <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> a region of the wastes where plants have become abundant.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|Zaimeche further {{observed}} that Islamic agricultural practice was documented by the mediaeval agronomists Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl (11th century) of Toledo {{in his book}} Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> them, including leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested, and gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
