40|$|Abstract. Successful eyelid reconstructions {{have been}} {{reported}} when using an axial nasal chondromucosal flap based on the dorsal nasal artery. The present study aimed to present a detailed anatomical description of the blood supply of the lateral nasal region and the <b>angular</b> <b>artery,</b> in order to propose the angular vessels as a new vascular pedicle for the island nasal chondromucosal flap. A total of 11 cadavers (22 hemi-faces) were examined. Observations {{with regard to the}} origin, course and distribution patterns of the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> were recorded. Based on the anatomical study findings, the angular vessels were proposed as a vascular source for the island nasal chondromucosal flap. Observations with regard to the varying origins of the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> were categorized into four types. The course of the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> along the nasojugal fold was constant. The <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> branched off into the upper two-thirds of the lateral nasal region and anas-tomosed with the other vascular branches on the nasal dorsum. Clinically, reconstruction of a full-thickness defect of the lower eyelid was successfully performed by using this composite flap based on the angular vessels and an adjacent orbicularis oculi myocutaneous flap. Satisfactory esthetic outcomes were obtained for the donor and recipient sites. The <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> is a good vascular source for an island nasal chondromucosal flap. The flap may be created safely and successfully in clinic. Island nasal chondromucosal flaps and nasolabial groove skin flaps based on the angular vessels may be designed simultane-ously for use on full-thickness defects of the eyelid...|$|E

40|$|In the {{surgical}} management of skull base lesions and vascular {{diseases such as}} giant aneurysms, involvement of the internal carotid artery may require the resection or {{the occlusion of the}} vessel. The anastomosis of the external carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery with venous graft may be indicated to re-establish the blood flow. To determine the best suture site in the middle cerebral artery, an anatomical study was carried out. Fourteen cerebral hemispheres were analysed after the injection of red latex into the internal carotid artery. The superior and inferior trunk of the main division of the middle cerebral artery have more than 2 mm of diameter. They are superficial allowing an anastomosis using a venous graft. The superior trunk has a disadvantage, it gives rise to branches for the precentral and post-central giri. The anastomosis with the inferior trunk presents lower risk of neurological deficit even though the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> originates from it...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{addition}} to prosthetic rehabilitation, maxillary defects {{can also be}} surgically reconstructed. Soft-tissue reconstruction employs a radial forearm or latissimus dorsi muscle flap, while bony reconstruction can be achieved using a fibula, iliac crest, or scapular flap. Reconstruction using a scapular flap is further divided into two subgroups: the traditional scapular flap with the circumflex scapular artery as the donor vessel and the scapular angle flap with the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> originating from the thoracodorsal artery as the donor vessel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on four patients who underwent successful reconstruction with a free scapular angle flap between 2009 and 2011, following maxillary resection due to malignancy. RESULTS: Vertical positioning of the scapular angle flap enables reconstruction of the facial contour, whereas its horizontal alignment and microvascular anastomosis makes a bony reconstruction of the hard palate possible. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility, low rate of donor site morbidity {{and shape of the}} scapular angle flap [...] which resembles that of the hard palate [...] render it ideal for plastic reconstruction. The suitability of bone quality for dental rehabilitation with implants is a topic of controversial discussion. The scapular angle flap represents an alternative to obturator prosthesis for the reconstruction of maxillary defects ≥ grade I according to Okay et al...|$|E
40|$|Because of its {{particular}} location, the nose {{is an extremely}} important anatomical region,given its prominent rolein social interaction. Therefore, invasive surgery of the nose should be followed by reconstructive procedure that should seek to respect its morphological and aesthetic features as much as possible. Numerous reconstructive solutions have been proposedsince ancient time, {{but the use of}} adjacent skin is the preferred repair method,because it has the same color and texture as the area to be reconstructed and respects aesthetic units and subunits. The glabellar region is often the only area with excess skin available for reconstruction,even when excisio has been generous. In 1997 Maruyama and Iwahira proposed an axial frontonasal flap based on the lateral branch of the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> to cover defects of the distal third of the nose.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Flow {{diversion}} {{is being}} increasingly {{used to treat}} cerebral aneurysms. We present our experience using these stents to treat aneurysms distal to the circle of Willis with parent arteries smaller than 2. 5 mm. METHODS: Aneurysms treated with a Pipeline Embolization Device in vessels less than 2. 5 mm between June 2012 and August 2014 were included. We evaluated risk factors, family history of aneurysms, aneurysm characteristics, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS) on admission and angiography and clinical outcome at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS: We included seven patients {{with a mean age}} of 65 years. The parent vessel size ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 3 mm; mean 1. 9 mm. Location of the aneurysms was as follows: two aneurysms centered along the pericallosal artery (one left, one right), one on the right <b>angular</b> <b>artery,</b> one aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery (ACom), one at the ACom-right A 2 anterior cerebral artery (ACA), one at the lenticulostriate artery, and one at the A 1 -A 2 ACA artery. Aneurysms ranged from 1 to 12 mm in diameter. All aneurysms were treated with a single Pipeline Embolization Device (PED). No peri- or post-procedural complications or mortality occurred. The patients were discharged with no change in NIHSS or mRS score. Angiographic follow-up was available in six patients. Angiography showed complete aneurysm occlusion in all. NIHSS and mRS remained unchanged at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results show that flow diversion technology is an effective and safe therapy for aneurysms located on small cerebral arteries. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate our promising results...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Surgical Sciences)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Aims: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} arterial variations by cadaveric dissection, in the forehead, in order to validate the practicality and implementation of planned forehead flaps and to increase the safety of forehead flaps in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Hypothesis tested: Unique frontal forehead flaps can be safely based on anatomical dissection and on the presence of the central vein and the anastomosing branches of the frontal ramifications of the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> (AA). Materials & methods: The study had two strategic components: an anatomical cadaveric study and a clinical study, based on the newly described forehead vasculature. The anatomical study consisted of a) dissection of 30 latex infused cadavers and 20 non-latexed cadavers; b) histological assessment of forehead vasculature of 20 cadavers. The clinical applicability study consisted of a cohort of 12 plastic and reconstructive surgery cases, undergoing nasal rhinoplasty, based on the cadaveric study and anatomical vasculature. The research was conducted within an ethical protocol and all patients gave informed consent. The follow-up period is 2 years. Results: In the cadaveric dissection, the following vessels, relevant to forehead flaps and nasal reconstruction, were consistently identified: DNA, FBSTA, STrA, TFA, AA, CA, CV, PCA, SOA and OV. Side branch analysis of STrA (N = 43) showed: MCB (60 %), LCB (23 %), SPA (26 %), OB (19 %), single VB (47 %), medial and lateral VB (53 %). Side branches of the supra-orbital artery (SOA) were: LRB (91 %), OB (91 %), VB (100 %), MB (44 %), BB (5 %) and SVB (9 %). Side branch profile of the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> (AA) was: DNA (96 %), CB (67 %) and PCA (47 %). In 71 % of cases the origin of the PCA was from the <b>angular</b> <b>artery</b> (AA). Individual artery side branches of the forehead were as follows: STrA (9), SOA (6), FBSTA (4), DNA (4), AA (3 / 4), CA (2) and PCA (2). Average diameter of the small arteries at point of entry ranged from 1 – 2 mm (CA < 1 mm, PCA < 1 mm). The central vein was a constant finding in all dissections and an important landmark. Other constant veins detected included the nasofrontal, ophthalmic, angular, supra-trochlear and facial veins. Twelve prospective randomized patients met inclusion criteria for nasal flap reconstruction, based on the cadaveric vascular study. Race profile was white (6), mixed (4) and black (2). There were 8 males and 4 females. Disease demographics included cancer (6; melanoma 2, basal cell cancer 5), trauma (3), infections (1) and congenital (1). Post-operative grading was as follows: defects corrected (12 / 12), subjective improvement (12 / 12), objective improvement (12 / 12), partial flap necrosis (1 / 12) and secondary interventions (debulking or revision 2 / 12). Doppler assessment for pedicle vasculature showed identification of the following arteries: TFA (85 %), STrA (65 %), PCA (20 %) and AA (25 %). Doppler studies further indicated the following small side branches: TFA (49 %), STrA (30 %), PCA (9 %), AA (12 %). The central vein was identified in 9 / 12 (75 %) by macroscopic examination. In one female with a basal cell carcinoma (BCC), modest dermal stock loss was demonstrated by the application of high frequency dermal ultrasound (Dermascan®). The results of the cadaveric anatomy study show the existence of various important subtle arterial variations in the forehead that are not described in the literature. Many arterial side branches not clearly named and others not described before, were highlighted in this anatomical study. Other observations regarding the anatomical relationships of the forehead nerves were of practical surgical value, the most important being to reduce sensory neuropraxia. The histological study endorsed the cadaver dissection observations and showed the importance of the flap vasculature at the proximal level of the pedicle. The clinical study with follow-up period of 24 months, illustrates an evolving refinement in surgical technique based on the findings of the anatomic vasculature study. A new method of planning a “ 2500 -year-old operation” was confidently developed based on the anatomical vasculature observations detected during the cadaver study. The Doppler study suggests that crude arterial variations of the central forehead, in the region of the intended flap pedicle, can not be diagnosed and highlighted accurately pre-operatively. The macroscopic anatomy of the central vein (clinical landmark) is an accurate predictor of underlying arterial variations and may be more valuable clinically than the hand-held Doppler examination. Conclusion: Comprehensive vascular anatomical detail of the forehead was not described accurately or completely by clinical anatomists in the past and does not appear in classic text books of anatomy and morphology. This has led to one-dimensional (arterial) application of the midline forehead flap planning and eventually the introduction of the para-median forehead flap, which has become the modern “work horse” of forehead flaps for nasal reconstruction. Now that in a definitive cadaveric study of the forehead blood supply has been demonstrated, the results show that surgeons will once again be able to embrace the midline forehead flap, only this time there will be possibly no inconsistent descriptions of unnamed blood vessels or ill-defined landmarks for flap planning. New flaps and reconstructive options in or around the forehead will be hopefully planned and executed more effectively and safer based on a more comprehensive understanding of the forehead anatomy and vasculature. The subjective and objective end-point analysis of the clinical study show favourable measured outcomes in the interim follow-up period (24 months) and benefit to the patients, in the presence of a low percentage of flap loss (1 / 12; 8. 3 %). The use of pre-operative Doppler assessment helped with flap planning. In one patient, the application of high frequency ultrasound facilitated long term follow-up regarding recurrent tumour formation and enhancement of dermal consistency with anti-aging creams, vitamin A derivations and sunscreens. Recommendations: The classic anatomy text books and clinical plastic surgery works with their inconsistent descriptions of the central forehead blood supply (arterial and venous) need to be updated. The evolution of the midline forehead flap method is far from complete. The refinement of the one-stage midline forehead flap method without an island is in progress and can clinically be implemented, based on a sound anatomical dissection study...|$|E
