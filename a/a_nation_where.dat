In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, {{including the right to}} work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king.

40|$|Nation {{building}} is vital in post-war states {{to bring the}} people that have been at war together. To restore peace in a state, many different actors need to work together to bring stability, safety, and advancement to <b>a</b> new <b>nation.</b> There are several methods of nation building, and this thesis evolves around three of them. This is a qualitative study where three theories on nation building are used to analyze the development of nation building, and the obstacles Bosnia and Herzegovina still has to reach a national identity. Several studies are used in this thesis to show how the development has evolved in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The method consisted of searching in databases for peer-reviewed articles, finding documents from international actors, and statistics.
