40|$|Among {{numerous}} Streptomyces-strains {{isolated from}} soils, F 1001, so-called in our laboratory, exhibited the widest inhibition zone against pathogenic {{bacteria in the}} course of our screening-tests. The fact suggests that this strain has an ability to produce the antibiotic in a large amount. Spirals are formed at the ends of hyphae only on the agarmedia extremely poor in nutrients. The hyphae excrete brown pigments that diffuse into the media, when a protein component such as meat extract or peptone is added. From this the strain seems to be of Chromogenus type. Judging from several taxonomic characteristics, we have identified it as one strain of Streptomyces aureus (Waksman and Curtius) group. Cultivation of the strain on 6 kinds of media of different compositions showed the glucose bouillon medium, rendered semicolloidal by adding 0. 25 % agar, as most suitable for the production of antibiotics. Optimum pH of the broth for growth as well as for potency is 7. 0, and optimum temperature for growth is 24 ℃, while that for potency is 30 ℃. Broth filtrates inhibit the growth of Staph. aureus in about 20, 000, 000 dilution, E scher. coli in about 200, 000 dilution.

Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) is an alternative method for colorants extraction. This study focuses {{on the influence of}} some operative parameters of PLE employed for the {{extraction of}} colorants from onion (Allium cepa) skins. Extractions were conducted at temperatures ranging from 50 to 150 °C with a pressure of 1000 psi and two extraction cycles of 15 minutes. The effect of two extraction solvents (distilled water and 0. 1 % HC 1 in methanol (v/v)) was examined. It was found that extraction temperature and type of extraction solvent influenced the yield and color of extracted colorant, and the composition of anthocyanins extracted. Elevated temperatures were found to increase the yield significantly, while the effect of extraction pressure was found to be insignificant. In <b>acidified</b> <b>methanol</b> extraction, the yields (colorant (g) / 100 g sample) varied from 9. 56 ± 0. 46 to 16. 71 ± 1. 60 while using water; the yields varied from 7. 06 ± 1. 30 to 20. 99 ± 0. 75. Highest amount of yield was obtained at 150 °C for both <b>acidified</b> <b>methanol</b> and water extractions. However, the color of extract changes from red to brownish red as the extraction temperature increased probably due to degradation of anthocyanins. The color measurement indicated that PLE method using <b>acidified</b> <b>methanol</b> gave stronger reddish shade compared to that extracted using water. Major anthocyanins compounds identified include cyanidin 3 -glucoside, cyanidin 3 -rutinoside and cyanidin chloride and their composition depended on the extraction temperature and type of solvent used.

The 2, 821 -Mr form of the peptide (streptin 2) has three additional amino acids (TPY) at the N terminus. Strain M 25 extracts also contained small quantities of the streptin 1 and streptin 2 peptides in various stages of dehydration. Streptin 1 and streptin 2 were each capable of specifically inducing streptin production when added to strain M 25 cultures. The streptin gene cluster resembled that of other type A 1 lantibiotics but appeared to lack a streptin-specific proteinase gene. Although the streptin structural gene (srtA) was widespread within S. pyogenes, being detected in 40 of 58 strains, each representing a different M serotype, only 10 of these srtA-positive strains produced active streptin.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the stability of anthocyanin colorant with and without ferulic acid (FA) stabilising agent in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder coating system. Design/methodology/approach - The anthocyanin colorant was extracted using <b>methanol</b> <b>acidified</b> with 0. 5 trifluoroacetic acid (TEA). FA was added to improve thermal stability of the colorant. The FA added colorant was mixed with PVA to develop a coating system. To test the ability of the coating mixture to withstand heat in the liquid state, spectroscopic studies were carried out in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when the liquid samples had cooled down to room temperature after being heated at 80 and 90 degrees C for 30 minutes. This procedure was repeated six times until a total heating time of 180 minutes has been accomplished. The liquid samples were also coated on glass slides, cured and then stored in different incubators at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C. The visible spectrum was taken everyday for 30 days to study the effect of storage temperature. Spectroscopic results were analysed in terms of intensity rate percentage (IRP). Findings - In the liquid state, the anthocyanin-PVA mixture without FA showed lower absorbance compared to the mixture containing FA after heating at 80 and 90 degrees C. This shows that FA can enhance the intensity of absorbance of the liquid coating mixture. The mixtures containing FA show increase in absorbance with increase in heating time. The same results are obtained for the coating on glass substrate where FA containing coatings show increase in IRP with time for all storage temperatures. Coating with 1 FA content showed better enhancement and stability. Research limitations/implications - The colour of the untreated samples quickly faded during heating and storage at different temperatures. In this study, the addition of 0. 5 and 1 FA stabilised and enhanced the colour intensity at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C. Further improvements may find the mixture suitable as paint or coating materials and as nail varnish. Practical implications - The results indicate the possibility of applying the FA stabilised anthocyanin-PVA, colorant-binder composition in a coating system. Originality/value - The use of anthocyanin from M. Malabathricum as a colourant in a coating system or nail varnish is original. Anthocyanin pigments are normally used as colorant in foods...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Microbial {{infections and}} {{resulting}} inflammation and oxidative stress are common pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders. In South Africa, {{several species of}} the genus Maytenus are used in traditional medicine to treat various infectious diseases. Most of the previous work on this genus was focused on nonpolar extracts from the root and bark. In this study, leaf extracts of polar extracts of Maytenus peduncularis, Maytenus procumbens, Maytenus senegalensis and Maytenus undata were evaluated for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities to determine their efficacy as therapeutic agents in GIT disorders. METHODS: Phenolic-enriched leaf extracts and fractions were prepared by extracting with <b>acidified</b> 70 % <b>methanol</b> and solvent-solvent fractionation. The activities of the fractions against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis as well as clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were determined using a serial microplate dilution method. Antioxidant activities were determined using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 - sulphonic acid) (ABTS), hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibitory assays. The phenolic composition {{as well as the}} cytotoxicity against Vero cell lines of the crude extracts was evaluated using various standard protocols. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities were concentrated in the non-polar fractions of hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate (MICs 19 – 312 μg/ml). The crude extracts and polar fractions (butanol and water) had moderate to poor antimicrobial activity (MICs 312 to above 2500 μg/ml). The crude extracts and polar fractions had good antioxidant activity (EC 50 values varied from 1. 22 to 607 μg/ml, 1. 71 to 312 μg/ml and 23 to 284 μg/ml for DPPH, ABTS and OH respectively. Linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition EC 50 values of the crude extracts ranged between 27 and 39 μg/ml with relatively low toxicity against Vero cell lines (IC 50 values 87 to 187 μg/ml). Fractionation of a crude extract with low activity could lead to fractions with more potent activity. CONCLUSION: This study justifies the traditional use of leaf crude extracts and fractions from these four plants to remedy gastrointestinal disorders resulting from infection, inflammation and oxidative stress complications. The study also provides rationale for the use of leaf extracts with same beneficial effects in place of unsustainable root and bark harvest. The South African Medical Research Council[URL]...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cortisol {{measurement}} {{is useful}} in evaluation of Cushing syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoid excess and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. We developed a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) method for salivary and urinary cortisol and we determined the 95 th percentile (p 95) for the urinary and salivary cortisol. We compared them to the Mayo Clinic expected values. METHODS: Saliva at 8 am and 11 pm and 24 h urine were obtained from 32 healthy (22 female, 34. 3 ± 9. 3 yo) volunteers. We performed validation with the enoval software (Arlenda, Belgium). For the validation, we used water or urine with spiked known amounts of cortisol for the CORS and CTU respectively. For the CORS, samples were centrifuged, deuterium labelled cortisol was added as internal standard and the protein precipated by acetonitril. The supernatant was evaporated, dissolved in <b>methanol</b> <b>acidified</b> with acetic acid and analyzed by LCMS/MS. For CTU, samples were centrifuged, deuterium labelled cortisol was added as internal standard and diluted by the ammonium acetate and analyzed by LCMS/MS. At the Mayo Clinic, the expected values were 1 - 7. 5 μg/L (7 a. m- 9 a. m) and < 1 μg/L (11 - 12 p. m) for CORS and 3. 5 - 45 μg/ 24 h (< 18 yo) for CTU. RESULTS: For the CTU, the with-in run did not exceed 3 % (0. 4 - 3 %) and the between-run did not exceed 3. 1 % (0. 4 - 3. 1 %) for 1. 5 - 750 μg/L. The limit of quantification was 1. 5 μg/L. The linearity was good between 1. 5 and 750 μg/L. The recovery is 97. 9 ± 2. 2 % (95 %CI for the mean: 92. 4 - 101. 1 %). For the CORS, the with-in run and between run did not exceed 8 % (1. 9 - 8 %) for 1. 15 - 8. 65 μg/L. The limit of quantification was 1. 15 μg/L. The analyse presents a good linearity between 1. 15 and 8. 65 μg/L. The recovery is 99. 9 ± 2. 9 % (95 %CI for the mean: 94. 2 - 108. 7 %). The p 95 for the CTU according to the CLSI C 28 -A 3 was 33 μg/ 24 h, and for the CORS was 5. 42 μg/L at 8 am and 0. 7 μg/L at 12 pm. CONCLUSIONS: Our developed method in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was validated for the measurement of urinary and salivary cortisol. Our findings indicate that the proposed analytical methods were suitable for routine purposes and useful in many pathological conditions. The expected values confirm these defined by the Mayo Clinic.

40|$|Separately, {{polyphenols}} {{and plant}} cell walls (PCW) are important {{contributors to the}} health benefits associated with fruits and vegetables. However, interactions with PCW which occur either during food preparation or mastication may affect bioaccessibility and hence bioavailability of polyphenols. Binding interactions between anthocyanins, phenolic acids (PAs) and PCW components, were evaluated using both a bacterial cellulose-pectin model system and a black carrot puree system. The majority of available polyphenols bound to PCW material with 60 - 70 % of available anthocyanins and PAs respectively binding to black carrot puree PCW matter. Once bound, release of polyphenols using <b>acidified</b> <b>methanol</b> is low with only similar to 20 % of total anthocyanins to similar to 30 % of PAs being released. Less than 2 % of bound polyphenol was released after in vitro gastric and small intestinal (S. I.) digestion for both the model system and the black carrot puree PCW matter. Confocal laser scanning microscopy shows localised binding of anthocyanins to PCW. Very similar patterns of binding for anthocyanins and PAs suggest that PAs form complexes with anthocyanins and polysaccharides. Time dependent changes in extractability with <b>acidified</b> <b>methanol</b> but not the total bound fraction suggests that initial nonspecific deposition on cellulose surfaces is followed by rearrangement of the bound molecules. Minimal release of anthocyanins and PAs after simulated gastric and S. I. digestion indicates that polyphenols in fruits and vegetables which bind to the PCW will be transported to the colon {{where they would be}} expected to be released by the action of cell wall degrading bacteria...|$|E
