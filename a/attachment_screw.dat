50|$|Along {{with the}} GH4, Panasonic also {{released}} the YAGH interface unit, a camera-attached device to increase {{input and output}} options for the GH4. The YAGH connects to the GH4 via <b>attachment</b> <b>screw</b> {{on the bottom of}} the camera, as well as a sliding mechanism which plugs into the camera’s HDMI port on the side. The interface contains 2 3-pin XLR Connector inputs, which are controlled by a pair of preamplifiers inside the unit, offering phantom power, more control over input gain levels and microphone choice, and input metering via LED meters on the interface. The YAGH also provides a timecode input for multi-device synchronization.|$|E
50|$|However, the investigation, {{released}} in August 2012, {{found that the}} probable cause of the crash were reused single-use locknuts in the left elevator trim tab system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an <b>attachment</b> <b>screw</b> and allowed the trim tab to flutter. This flutter caused the trim tab link assembly to fail which led to loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right trim tab had been fixed in place. Had both trim tabs been operational, {{the loss of the}} left trim tab alone may not have caused loss of control. When the trim tab failed, Leeward was exposed to 17Gs which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} here {{was conducted to}} address issues raised regarding mechanical testing of <b>attachment</b> <b>screws</b> described in SAND 2005 - 6036, {{as well as to}} increase the understanding of screw behavior through additional testing. Efforts were made to evaluate fixture modifications and address issues of interest, including: fabrication of 45 {sup o} test fixtures, measurement of the frictional load from the angled fixture guide, employment of electromechanical displacement transducers, development of a single-shear test, and study the affect of thread start orientation on single-shear behavior. A 286 and 302 HQ, No. 10 - 32 socket-head cap screws were tested having orientations with respect to the primary loading axis of 0 {sup 0 }, 45 {sup o}, 60 {sup o}, 75 {sup o} and 90 {sup o} at stroke speeds 0, 001 and 10 in/sec. The frictional load resulting from the angled screw fixture guide was insignificant. Load-displacement curves of A 286 screws did not show a minimum value in displacement to failure (DTF) for 60 {sup o} shear tests. Tests of 302 HQ screws did not produce a consistent trend in DTF with load angle. The effect of displacement rate on DTF became larger as shear angle increased for both A 286 and 302 HQ screws...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess {{improvements}} in fixation stability when a hinged unilateral external fixator {{is used to}} supplement compromised internal fixation for distal humerus fractures. Methods: Removing a 1 -cm section of the distal humerus in cadaveric whole-arm specimens created a comminuted distal humerus fracture model (AO type 13 -A 3). Fixation was then performed using different constructs representing optimal, compromised, or supplemented internal fixation. Internal fixation consisted of either 2 reconstruction plates with 1, 2, or 3 (optimal) distal <b>attachment</b> <b>screws,</b> or crossing medial and lateral cortical screws. A hinged external fixator was applied in combination with compromised internal fixation. The stability of the different constructs was then evaluated using 3 -point bending stiffness and distal fragment displacement measurements during flexion and extension testing. Results: Addition of the external fixator increased the stiffness of all constructs. Stiffness of the compromised reconstruction plate constructs with supplemented fixation was similar to or significantly {{greater than that of}} optimal internal fixation. Addition of the fixator to the reconstruction plates with 1 screw or the crossing screws produced displacements of the distal fragment that were {{similar to those of the}} compromised constructs alone. However, medial/lateral and anterior/posterior displacements of the distal fragment during flexion and extension of the elbow for supplemented fixation were found to be greater than those for optimal internal fixation. Conclusions: The use of a hinged external fixator for supplemental fixation of distal humerus fractures may be effective in cases where internal fixation is severely compromised, although displacements may increase above optimal fixation...|$|R

5000|$|The sheet is {{attached}} midway along the boom {{or at the}} free end, typically {{by means of a}} block. The block is typically attached to the boom by means of a bail, which is a U-shaped piece of metal, flattened at the ends to allow <b>attachment</b> with <b>screws</b> or rivets. In smaller boats such as dinghies it is used to control the angle of the sail to the wind on each point of sail. On largest boats this function is largely assumed by the traveller and the main sheet is used to adjust the twist of the sail to present the luff of the sail to the wind all of the way up the mast. Easing the main sheet increases twist and the twist is usually adjusted so that the aft end of the top batten in the main sail runs parallel to the boom. The traveller is a track running {{from one side of the}} boat to the other upon which sits a car to which the other end of the sheet {{is attached}}. Moving the car from side to side alters the angle of the boom to the centreline of the boat while minimising the effect on the twist of the sail.|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>attachment</b> to the vertebrae {{is an important}} factor affecting their motion resistance and long term performance. Low bone quality, e. g. in osteopenic patients, keeps the screw bone interface at risk for subsidence and dislocation. In such cases, bone cement could be used to augment pedicle screw fixation. But its use is not free of risk. Therefore, clinicians, especially spine surgeons, radiologists, and internists should become increasingly aware of cement migration and embolism as possible complications. Here, we present an instructive case of cement embolism into the venous system after augmented screw fixation with fortunately asymptomatic clinical course. In addition we discuss pathophysiology and prevention methods as well as therapeutic management of this potentially life-threatening complication in a comprehensive review of the literature. However, only a few case reports of cement embolism into the venous system were published after augmented screw fixation...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the retention force of an O-ring attachment system in different inclinations to the ideal path of insertion, using devices to compensate angulations. Material and methods Two implants were inserted into an aluminum base, and ball <b>attachments</b> were <b>screwed</b> to implants. Cylinders with O-rings were placed on ball attachments and connected to the test device using positioners to compensate implant angulations (0 degrees, 7 degrees, and 14 degrees). Plexiglass bases were used to simulate implant angulations. The base and the test device were positioned in a testing apparatus, which simulated insertion/removal of an overdenture. A total of 2900 cycles, simulating 2 years of overdenture use, were performed and 36 O-rings were tested. The force required for each cycle was recorded with computer software. Longitudinal sections of ball attachment-positioner-cylinder with O-rings of each angulation were obtained to analyze the relationship among them, and O-ring sections tested in each angulation were compared with an unused counterpart. A mixed linear model was used to analyze the data, and the comparison was performed by orthogonal contrasts (alpha= 0. 05). Results At 0 degrees, the retention force decreased significantly over time, and the retention force was significantly different in all comparisons, except from 12 to 18 months. When the implants were positioned at 7 degrees, the retention force was statistically different at 0 and 24 months. At 14 degrees, significant differences were found from 6 and 12 to 24 months. Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that O-rings for implant/attachments perpendicular to the occlusal plane were adequately retentive over the first year and that the retentive capacity of O-ring was affected by implant inclinations despite the proposed positioners.

40|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} (SRS), {{a highly}} technical treatment for life-threatening brain tumors and vascular malformations, is provided at one site (Dunedin Hospital) for all New Zealand. The full-day procedure {{begins with the}} surgical <b>attachment</b> by bone <b>screws</b> of a metal helmet, followed by computerized tomography with or without angiography, and concludes with focused irradiation of the lesion. Previous SRS {{research has focused on}} therapeutic indications and outcomes; we report here patients' experiences of this procedure using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Participants (n= 12) uniformly described SRS as unusual and highly significant, a pivotal event shaping the future. For most, the procedure symbolized relief of symptoms, hope, reduction of risk, and recovery. Descriptions of the disruption produced by the onset of symptoms, diagnostic procedures and SRS, followed by a period of uncertain prognosis, also signaled experiences of liminality. Although patients experienced anxiolysis and described status changes following SRS, their lives are not returned to normal; they continue to inhabit a liminal state between health and normality on one hand, illness and disability on the other. Our findings indicate aspects of the experience of SRS for patients and their families that could assist in technically informing and emotionally supporting patients through this unusual treatment.

40|$|During the {{surgical}} preparation of bone, prior to insertion of an implant, bone will be traumatized {{which leads to}} local resorption. Consequently, early implant fixation might be reduced. Impaired early fixation, as evidenced by radiostereometry, {{has been associated with}} increased risk of late loosening. Bisphosphonates are known to inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts and have shown to increase implant fixation when administered systemically or locally directly at the bone prior to implant insertion. A method to bind bisphosphonates directly to the implant was developed. Stainless steel screws were coated with crosslinked fibrinogen, serving as an anchor for bisphosphonate <b>attachment.</b> The <b>screws</b> were inserted in the tibial metaphysis in rats and implant fixation was analyzed with pullout measurements. Bisphosphonate coated screws turned out to have 28 % higher pullout force at 2 weeks compared to control screws with the fibrinogen coating only. The next experiment was designed to measure at what stage in the healing process the strongest bisphosphonate effect was gained. Bisphosphonate coated screws were expected to reduce the resorption of the traumatized bone. However, no decreased fixation was found in the control group. Instead, the fixation increased with time, and so did the effect of the bisphosphonates. At 8 weeks, the pullout force was twice as high for screws with bisphosphonate compared to control screws. By histology at 8 weeks, a bone envelope was found around bisphosphonate coated screws but absent around control screws. Thus, the anti catabolic action of the bisphosphonate resulted in an increased amount of bone surrounding the bisphosphonate screws. Titanium is generally considered to be better fixated in bone compared to stainless steel. The coating technique was found to be applicable on titanium as well, again with improved fixation. A majority of fractures occur in osteoporotic bone. Despite the relatively low amount of bisphosphonates at the screws, the bisphosphonate coating improved implant fixation at 2 weeks also in rats made osteoporotic by ovariectomy. In conclusion, bisphosphonates bound to titanium or stainless steel screws coated with fibrinogen increased fixation in bone, in rats. These results suggest that the bisphosphonate and fibrinogen coating might improve the fixation of screw shaped implants and possibly also arthroplasties, in humans...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the current methods for testing for {{osteoporosis}} has been carried out, followed by porosity, to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and show how a new low-cost testing method could benefit the early onset detection of osteoporosis. The method has then been derived from a review of stress wave testing methods, which are primarily used to detect damage to trees or structures, measuring differences in {{the speed of sound}} transmission through impulse or impact, as well as the resonant frequency of the sample (among other properties). Measurement methods are described {{that can be used to}} detect a change in the speed of sound transmission caused by changes to porosity within a wooden dowel sample. A shaker and force transducer were first used to generate and measure a force applied transversally (perpendicular to the surface) to a solid sample, the transmitted wave was then captured by measuring acceleration on the surface of sample a set distance away from the impulse. Results showed that when the porosity was increased by drilling, the speed of sound was reduced. <b>Attachment</b> via a <b>screw</b> meant that this method would be destructive to the sample, and so the shaker was replaced by an impact hammer. A National Instruments LabView system has been used to acquire the signals using a USB oscilloscope, reliably calculate the speed of sound transmission, and save the data to file. Results for measurements taken with the impact hammer showed that an increase in porosity causes a reduction to the speed of sound transmission, with an average change of - 19. 12 ± 5. 68 m/s per 1 % increase in the porosity of a pine wood sample, and a t-stat p-value of < 0. 05, showing a high statistically significant difference between the means. Regression analysis shows that the change is very close to linear, with an average r 2 value of r 2 = 0. 98931 across the 3 distances measured. The system could be improved in the future with more powerful acquisition hardware, and a more repeatable testing procedure, which could potentially be adapted for use on humans to detect variations in bone density caused by osteoporosis...|$|R
