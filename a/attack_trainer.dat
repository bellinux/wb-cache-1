Smith gallantly waved to the crowd when a second orca slammed into him. He continued to pretend he was unhurt as the whales repeatedly dragged him to the bottom of the stadium pool. Smith was cut all around his torso, had a ruptured kidney and a six-inch laceration of his liver, yet he managed to escape the pool with his life.

5000|$|In 1978, Garrett {{announced}} {{joint research}} on the TFE1042 afterburner with Swedish company Volvo Flygmotor AB {{in order to provide}} an engine for the AIDC F-CK Indigenous Defence Fighter (IDF) being developed for the Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force (ROCAF). The TFE731 Model 1042 was touted as a low bypass ratio [...] "military derivative of the proven commercial TFE731 engine" [...] and [...] "provides efficient, reliable, cost effective propulsion {{for the next generation of}} light strike and advanced trainer aircraft", with thrust of 4260 lbf (18.9 kN) dry and 6790 lbf (30.2 kN) with afterburner. After initial negotiation, the investment was going to be divided between Garrett, Volvo, AIDC, and Italian company Piaggio. The development would consist of the non-afterburning TFE1042-6 for light <b>attack</b> aircraft/advanced <b>trainer,</b> and TFE1042-7 for the AMX or F-5 upgrade. Garrett would be responsible for the core engine, and Volvo would be responsible for the fan section and the afterburner. The engine first ran for 3 hours at a Volvo test facility in 1979.|$|R
25|$|The {{report also}} {{concluded}} that Incognito, Jerry, and Pouncey made severe racial slurs towards the assistant trainer, and Incognito and Jerry even taunted him {{by saying that}} they had sex with his girlfriend.

50|$|Using a {{swarm of}} wasps {{as a means of}} {{psychological}} interrogation, Doug gets the captured soldier to reveal the location of the convoy. He then phones Chappy, but discovers that his team has been apprehended by Kettle. At one of the chemical weapon chambers, Chappy is told by Kettle that the first target of Operation Pandora is Cuba. After Kettle leaves the chamber, Kitty hacks the computer to set off the fire extinguishing units, giving Chappy's team time to escape. A stray shot from one of the soldiers ruptures the canister, contaminating the chamber and killing Dr. Francis Gully and everyone inside. As Kitty and Peter sneak into the cargo plane carrying the chemical weapon, Chappy sends a radio message, warning everyone of a hostile aircraft heading to Cuba. Shortly after recapturing Chappy, Kettle orders his fighter squadron to shoot down the trainer planes. The squadron of two fighters <b>attacks</b> the <b>trainers,</b> only to be confronted by Doug, who has commandeered a fighter plane. Doug and the students shoot down the attackers promptly. He then plays the cassette tape Chappy recorded for him before killing ace pilot Maj. Miles Pierce in a dogfight.|$|R
25|$|Complete demobilization of the Air Service was {{accomplished}} within a year. By November 22, 1919, the Air Service {{had been reduced}} to one construction, one replacement, and 22 flying squadrons; 32 balloon companies; 15 photographic sections; and 1,168 officers and 8,428 enlisted men. The combat strength of the Air Service was only four pursuit and four bombardment squadrons. Although the leaders of the reorganized Air Service persuaded the General Staff to increase the combat strength to 20 squadrons by 1923, the balloon force was demobilized, including dirigibles, and personnel shrank even further, to just 880 officers. By July 1924, the Air Service inventory was 457 observation planes, 55 bombers, 78 pursuit planes, and 8 <b>attack</b> aircraft, with <b>trainers</b> to make the total number 754.|$|R
50|$|The Thrillers {{soon became}} the new enforcers for Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff by {{replacing}} their original enforcers, the Filthy Animals.

At Fall Brawl, the Thrillers and the Animals faced off in an elimination match. The Thrillers eliminated all but two members of the Animals, with the match ending in a no-contest after Orndoff legitimately injured himself after botching his signature piledriver. The following night on Nitro, the Thrillers wrestled against the two survivors from their elimination match, Rey Misterio Jr. and Tygress, but lost.|$|R

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. It was filmed on April 5, 1990 using live concert footage from Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour at the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. In addition to the audience for the sold-out show, the filming reportedly drew an additional 3,000 fans. The video premiered during the tour's first date at the Tacoma Dome, projected on three screens prior to Jackson appearing on stage. It was later debuted on MTV and other music channels in August. The video uses an [...] "in concert" [...] theme, in a similar concept to other hard rock and heavy metal music videos of the era, being a departure from her heavily choreographed videos with various settings. Spliced footage of a black panther is shown throughout the video. Jackson explained, [...] "Black panthers fascinate me. They've become an obsession. During filming, we used a black panther who actually <b>attacked</b> his <b>trainer.</b> Don't ask me why, but I was never fearful. I feel a strange rapport with panthers. They've become an inner symbol. Maybe it's their beauty, maybe their danger, maybe the poetry of their movement. It's as though their strength protects me." [...] It was later included on the Rhythm Nation Compilation and Design of a Decade video release.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, While {{warming up}} in the bullpen to enter {{what would have been}} the first game of his season as a relief pitcher, LaChappa {{collapsed}} and suffered a heart <b>attack.</b> The Quakes <b>trainer</b> performed CPR on LaChappa for 20 minutes until he was taken to a local hospital. At the hospital, he suffered a second heart attack. LaChappa survived, but suffered brain damage from the lack of oxygen and is mostly confined to a wheelchair and has difficulty moving and speaking. Since the incident, the Padres organization has signed him yearly to a basic Minor League contract so that he can maintain his health insurance. The Padres have also named a Little League field after him in Lakeside, California. The Matt LaChappa Athletic Scholarship Foundation was also established to assist high school students to pay for their college education.|$|R
