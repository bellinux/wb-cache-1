When adjusted for cluster design, the mean difference in haemoglobin decreases between groups was not significant (0 · 3 g/L, 95 % CI − 8 · 26 to 8 · 92, p= 0 · 71). Both drugs were well tolerated. Shivering was common in the misoprostol group, and nausea in the oxytocin group. Postpartum haemorrhage was diagnosed in one woman allocated to oxytocin, who was referred and transferred to a higher-level facility for additional care, and fully recovered. No other women were transferred. Interpretation: In terms of effects on haemoglobin concentrations, neither oxytocin nor misoprostol was significantly better than the other, and both drugs were safe and efficacious when delivered by <b>auxiliary</b> <b>midwives.</b> The programmatic limitations of oxytocin, including short shelf life outside the cold chain, mean that misoprostol could be more appropriate for community-level prophylaxis of postpartum haemorrhage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In India, the {{hypertensive}} disorders {{of pregnancy}} and postpartum haemorrhage {{are responsible for}} nearly 40 % of all maternal deaths. Most of these deaths occur in primary health settings which frequently lack essential equipment and medication, are understaffed, and have limited or no access to specialist care. Community health care workers are regarded as essential providers of basic maternity care; {{and the quality of}} care they provide is dependent on the level of knowledge and skills they possess. However, there is limited research regarding their ability to manage pregnancy complications. This study aims to describe the current state of knowledge regarding pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among community health care workers (<b>auxiliary</b> nurse <b>midwives,</b> accredited social health activists, staff nurses) in northern Karnataka, India. Furthermore, this study describes the treatment approaches used by various cadres of community health workers for these conditions. The findings of this study can help plan focussed training sessions to build upon their strengths and to address the identified gaps. METHODS: Data were collected {{as part of a larger}} study aimed at assessing the feasibility of community-based treatment for pre-eclampsia. Eight focus group discussions were conducted in 2012 - 2013 in northern Karnataka State: four with staff nurses and <b>auxiliary</b> nurse <b>midwives</b> and four with accredited social health activists. In addition, twelve <b>auxiliary</b> nurse <b>midwives</b> and staff nurses completed questionnaires to explore their competence and self-efficacy in managing pre-eclampsia. Qualitative data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated for thematic analysis using NVivo 10. RESULTS: Community health workers described their understanding of the origins of hypertension and seizures in pregnancy. Psychological explanations of hypertension were most commonly reported: stress, tension, and fear. The most common explanation for eclampsia was not receiving a tetanus vaccination. Despite some common misperceptions regarding aetiology, these community health workers demonstrated a good grasp of the potential consequences of hypertension in pregnancy. According to <b>auxiliary</b> nurse <b>midwives</b> and staff nurses, if hypertension was detected they encouraged rest, decreased salt intake, iron supplementation and tetanus vaccination. In addition, some staff nurses administered antihypertensives, MgSO 4, or other anticonvulsants. All <b>auxiliary</b> nurse <b>midwives</b> had some awareness of MgSO 4, but none had administered it themselves. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that knowledge regarding the aetiology of pre-eclampsia was limited. Nevertheless, their basic knowledge and skills could be strengthened to more effectively manage the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in their communities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01911494...|$|R

40|$|Background: In India, the {{practice}} of breastfeeding is almost universal, but initiation of breastfeeding is generally quite late and colostrum is discarded. Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) strategy recommended systematic assessment of breastfeeding and emphasized counseling of the mother on proper positioning and attachment of infant to the breast. Objective: To assess breastfeeding among mothers of below six months children in rural Wardha. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional study was undertaken in surrounding 23 villages of Kasturba Rural Health Training Center (KRHTC), Anji. Two <b>Auxiliary</b> Nurse <b>Midwives</b> (ANMs) trained in IMNCI paid house visits to 99 mothers {{during the study period}} and undertook the assessment of breastfeeding using IMNCI assessment form for young infants. <b>Auxiliary</b> Nurse <b>Midwives</b> observed and recorded the positioning and attachment of infant to the breast as per IMNCI guidelines. The data were entered and analyzed using Epi_Info (version 6. 04 d) software package. Results: Most of the deliveries 94 (94. 9 &#x 0025;) took place in the healthcare facilities. Majority 61 (61. 6 &#x 0025;) newborn babies had received breastfeeding within half an hour. About half of the mothers had any of the feeding problems like feeding less than eight times in 24 h, giving any other food or drinks or is low weight for age. Significantly more mothers with feeding problems had problems in positioning and attachment of infant to the breast as compared with those mothers who did not have any feeding problems. Conclusions: In the settings, where practice of institutional delivery is high, the staff of healthcare facility should ensure education of the mothers regarding position and attachment of infant to the breast before discharge from the healthcare facility.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Midwives</b> (AMWs) are {{community}} health volunteers supporting {{the work of}} midwives, especially {{maternal and child health}} services in hard to-reach areas in Myanmar. This paper assessed the contributions of AMW to maternal and child health services, factors influencing their productivity and their willingness to serve the community. Method The study applied quantitative cross-sectional survey using census method. Total of 1, 185 AMWs belonging to three batches: trained prior to 2000, between 2000 and 2011, and in 2012, from 21 townships of 17 states and regions in Myanmar participated in the study. Multiple logit regression was used to examine the impact of age, marital status, education, domicile, recruitment pattern and ‘batch of training’, on AMW’s confidence level in providing care, and their intention to serve the community more than 5  years. Results All AMWs were able to provide essential maternal and child health services including antenatal care, normal delivery and post-natal care. They could identify and refer high-risk pregnancies to larger health facilities for proper management. On average, 9 deliveries, 11 antenatal and 9 postnatal cases were performed by an AMW during the six months prior to this study. AMWs had a comparative advantage for longer service in hard-to-reach villages where they lived, spoke the same dialect as the locals, understood the socio-cultural dimensions, and were well accepted by the community. Despite these contributions, 90  % of the respondents expressed receiving no adequate supervision, refresher training, replenishment of the AMW kits and transportation cost. AMWs in the elder age group are significantly more confident in taking care of the patients than those in the younger groups. Over 90  % of the respondents intended to stay more than five years in the community. The confidence in catering services appeared to have significant association with a longer period of stay in AMW jobs as evidenced by the odds ratio of 3. 5, compared to those reporting unconfident. Conclusions Comprehensive support system and national policy are needed to sustain and strengthen the contributions of AMWs, in sharing the workload of midwives, particularly in hard-to-reach areas of Myanmar...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to find out the role of cultural factors, such as ANMs’ caste, age, marital status, being non-resident in the working village and other social factors regarding their acceptance in the community. The study is exploratory and qualitative. The area of study was a multi-caste remote village, Mavaibhachan, in Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and fieldwork notes taken during and immediately after the interviews with ANMs, and thematically analyzed. Our results show that if ANMs belong to a different caste group, do not live in the working village and are relatively younger, they are socially insecure and stressed and the community hardly accepts them. Despite direct interface with the community, their social status and lowest position in the health system is reflected in acceptability and recognition. The position of ANMs needs to be strengthened, within society and the health system.

Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS) is a centralized information technology (IT) -based application launched in 2009 for improving the delivery of {{maternal and child health}} care services through name-based tracking. There is minimal evidence in the literature evaluating the operational aspects of such a name-based tracking system even after 5 years of its implementation. Objective: The present study was thus conducted to understand the opportunities and challenges in the operationalization of MCTS strategy in a district in Haryana and to understand the stakeholder′s perspectives. Materials and Methods: Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework was used. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Shahzadpur block of Ambala district, Haryana, India involving in-depth interviews of health care providers and clients in 12 subcenters (SCs) and two primary health centers (PHCs). Results: Lack of appropriate training, overburdened data entry operator (DEO) and <b>auxiliary</b> nurse <b>midwife</b> (ANM), poor Internet connectivity, slow server speed, and frequent power failures were revealed as major limitations for the effective implementation of MCTS.
