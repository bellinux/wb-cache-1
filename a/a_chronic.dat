5|$|Acne vulgaris is <b>a</b> <b>chronic</b> {{skin disease}} of the pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles.

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is <b>a</b> <b>chronic</b> neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 {{in the two}} states. Due to <b>a</b> <b>chronic</b> lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981.

The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of construction.
