5|$|Inspector Lomax {{was played}} by Jack Warner, who {{appeared}} by {{arrangement with the}} J. Arthur Rank Organisation, with whom he was contracted. At {{the time he was}} best known as the star of Here Come the Huggetts (1948) and its sequels. Shortly after finishing The Quatermass Xperiment, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with, as the title character in Dixon of Dock Green (1955–76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax's futile attempts to find the time to have <b>a</b> <b>shave</b> with his electric razor.|$|E
5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him <b>a</b> <b>shave</b> and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E

In order to find out who, McGarrett and Danny turn to Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), one of John's proteges. He left the Honolulu Police Department disgraced after {{he was accused of}} corruption. After Chin Ho asserts his innocence, McGarrett offers him to join his task force. The trio meet with Chin Ho's friend, former police informant and current owner of <b>a</b> <b>shave</b> ice business Kamekona (Teila Tuli). Kamekona believes the snakehead leader is Sang Min (Will Yun Lee). In order to apprehend Sang Min, Chin Ho decides to appoint his cousin, Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park) as a plant. Kono was a former professional surfer turned police academy graduate. She goes undercover as a Chinese immigrant to meet with Sang Min. The conversation is monitored {{by the rest of the}} team through up-to-date laser audio surveillance, eliminating the need for a wire. However, it has emerged that Sang Min has a mole in HPD, who identifies Kono as a cop. The team storm the warehouse, and McGarrett apprehends Sang Min.|$|E

That's where he first learned that the Cowboys were armed. Behan stated he quickly {{finished}} his shave and went to locate the Cowboys. At about 2:30pm he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and talking to someone on Fourth Street near the corner of Fremont. When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly's photography studio, he walked there with Frank. He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms. Ike Clanton said he was not armed, and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon.|$|E
500|$|The {{force that}} Allen had {{assembled}} in Castleton included about 100 Green Mountain Boys, about 40 men raised by James Easton and John Brown at Pittsfield, {{and an additional}} 20 men from Connecticut. [...] Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and Seth Warner as his lieutenants. [...] When Arnold arrived on the scene, Samuel Herrick had already been sent to Skenesboro and Asa Douglas to Panton with detachments to secure boats.

Theodore Roosevelt commented {{that the only thing}} different between Hughes and Wilson was <b>a</b> <b>shave.</b> However, Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans, and his campaign never assumed a definite form. Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes, reserving his attacks for Roosevelt. When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly, Wilson told a friend, [...] "Never murder a man who is committing suicide." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Greeks and Romans {{are known}} to have played many ball games, some of which {{involved}} the use of the feet.

2500|$|Ivanov, an exiled Russian {{and former}} {{military}} officer living in Berlin, {{has taken up}} employment as a barber; an apt position, Nabokov notes, as Ivanov's sharp facial appearance had earned him the nickname [...] "Razor" [...] in his earlier life. On a hot day, an unnamed character dressed largely in black enters the barber's, deserted save for Ivanov, and requests <b>a</b> <b>shave.</b> Ivanov quickly realises that the customer is a fellow Russian who, the reader gathers, tortured Ivanov during Russia's period of revolutionary upheaval. With the unnamed character sitting in the chair, his face lathered with shaving cream, Ivanov reminds him of their last encounter. Ivanov then proceeds begins to shave him, recounting their previous meeting while also strongly hinting at the effect that one slip of the razor could have. The reader half expects Ivanov to exact his revenge. But having told his story, Ivanov relents and the terrified and clean-shaven Soviet flees from the barber's.|$|E
2500|$|Jack [...] "the Dandy" [...] Parisi {{was acquitted}} of two murders, Teamsters {{official}} Morris Diamond in Brooklyn and music-publishing executive Irving Penn in the Bronx. Penn was killed by mistaken identity, as the intended target, Philip Orlofsky, a Cutters Union official, left his home early to get <b>a</b> <b>shave</b> the day his killers waited for him. Parisi was a fugitive for 10 years, until he was captured in Pennsylvania in 1949. Albert Tannenbaum was brought in from Atlanta, where he was reportedly living, to testify for the prosecution. One accomplice in the Penn murder, Jacob [...] "Kuppy" [...] Migden, who provided the erroneous identification of Penn and {{who was also a}} fugitive for several years, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree assault {{in the middle of his}} murder trial and was sentenced to a term of 5–10 years. Each of Parisi's murder trials ended with an acquittal, as the judges directed a verdict of not-guilty due to the lack of corroborating evidence, since the chief witnesses for the prosecution were accomplices. He died at home of natural causes on December 27, 1982, at the age of 85.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>shaving</b> scuttle and shaving mug were {{developed}} around the 19th century; the first patent for <b>a</b> <b>shaving</b> mug is dated 1867. As hot water was not common in many households, {{one way to}} provide hot lather was to use a scuttle or mug. A traditional scuttle resembles a teapot with a wide spout where hot water is poured in; {{this is where it}} differs from <b>a</b> <b>shaving</b> mug, which has no spout. Both shaving scuttles and mugs usually have a handle, but some have none. Shaving mugs often look like a standard mug, however, some also have a built in brush rest, so the brush does not sit in lather. Modern versions of the scuttle are in limited production, usually by independent potters working in small volumes.|$|R

At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed [...] "Hard" [...] for the very first time, then performed [...] "Run This Town" [...] with Jay-Z. Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produced the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti. Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical. Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her screen door. He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money. Mrs. Harmon told the man that she had very little turpentine and had no money or food. The man then grabbed Mrs. Harmon by the hair and dragged her out onto the porch. He told her that he might as well kill her since he had already killed three or four people and {{that he was going to}} rape her. He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If you report this to officers I'll come back and kill you." [...] After the man ran off, the woman took her child with her to a neighbor's house further up the street and reported it to the police. Soon after her report, a widespread search for the man included 20 officers and 160 residents. She described the man as a 5'9-10 white man about 40 or 45 years old, about 150 to 155pounds, with dark hair, and was in bad need of <b>a</b> <b>shave.</b> He carried an open, five-inch bladed pocket knife and was wearing gloves, a faded and worn blue shirt with khakis, and had an old, dirty, dark-colored flopped hat.|$|E
2500|$|Uncle Sammy Morris (Series 7, Series 8–9) (Kenneth Connor) Children's Entertainer – Uncle Sammy was an {{independent}} children's entertainer {{who had fallen}} on hard times and was [...] "discovered" [...] by Ted on the beach at Grapethorpe. During World War II Sammy had served in the army under Clive's uncle, General Dempster, and had crossed the Rhine in 1945. He was then based in Vienna and had helped Joe Maplin to flee the country {{when he was on the}} run from the police, resulting in Maplin owing him a favour. Ted brought Sammy to the camp to replace Mr Partridge, but soon after he absconded with a sack of Joe Maplin's trophies and was subsequently arrested. Sammy used his knowledge of Joe Maplin's shady past to blackmail him into dropping the charges and giving him a full-time job at the camp, but spent his first weeks sleeping in a hedge and eating rubbish from the dustbins. Sammy eventually settled into his job, and entertained the children dressed as a schoolmaster, rather than performing Punch and Judy shows. He once again used his leverage over Joe Maplin to get rid of Alec Foster, the camp controller. Sammy later took a shine to a woman who worked in the Happy Halibut Fish Bar, and finally had a bath, <b>a</b> <b>shave,</b> a haircut and new clothes. After the 1960 season ended, Sammy revealed he had acquired a job over the winter working as a Father Christmas at Whiteleys. It is unknown what Sammy intended to do after this, but he stated in the final episode that his job at Maplins and his friendship with Fred Quilley had changed his life forever.|$|E
