The recovery decision was contested before the General Court. The Commission claimed that the applicants lacked standing, but this was rejected by the Court which found that belonging to a closed class of actual beneficiaries of an aid scheme affected by the obligation to repay aid was sufficient to differentiate them from all other persons. On substance, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the measures were compensation for additional costs arising from their location in the Venice lagoon (not State aid), that the Commission had failed to account of the situation of undertakings other than selected municipal companies, and that the Commission had infringed Article 107 (3) (c) in relation to regional aid. The substantive claims were rejected by the General Court. The applicants also challenged the legality of the recovery order, arguing that the measure was a mere extension in time and territory of a measure dating back to the 1970 s. This was not accepted by the General Court which accordingly dismissed the actions. The applicants appealed the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice.

This formulation leads to a set of nonlinear updating rules reminiscent from the “value iteration” algorithm. Interestingly enough, when the degree of exploration is zero for all states (no exploration), these equations reduce to Bellman’s equations for finding the shortest path while, when it is maximum, a full “blind ” exploration is performed. We further show that if the graph of states is directed and acyclic, the nonlinear equations can easily be solved by performing a single backward pass from the destination state. The theoretical results are confirmed by simple simulations showing that the model behaves as expected. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{qualitative}} {{theory of}} differential equations, {{an important role}} is played by special classes of solutions, like periodic solutions or solutions to some boundary value problems. When a system of ordinary differential equations has equilibria, i. e. constant solutions, whose stability properties are known, it is significant to search for connections between them by trajectories of solutions of the given system. These are called homoclinic or heteroclinic, according to whether they describe a loop based at one single equilibrium or they "start" and "end" at two distinct equilibria. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} study of heteroclinic solutions for a specific class of ordinary differential equations related to the Extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation and the Swift-Hohenberg equation. These are semilinear fourth order bi-stable evolution equations which appear as mathematical models for problems arising in Mechanics, Chemistry and Biology. For such equations, the set of bounded stationary solutions is of great interest. These solve an autonomous fourth order equation. In this thesis, we focus on such equations having a variational structure. In that case, the solutions are critical points of an associated action functional defined in convenient functional spaces. We then look for heteroclinic solutions as minimizers of the action functional. Our main contributions concern existence and multiplicity results of such global and local minimizers in the case where the functional is defined from sign changing Lagrangians. The underlying idea is to impose conditions which imply a lower bound on the <b>action</b> over all <b>admissible</b> functions. We then combine classical arguments of the Calculus of Variations with careful estimates on minimizing sequences to prove the existence of a minimum. (MATH 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

Is {{it possible}} to augment the repertoire of <b>admissible</b> <b>actions</b> and still keep the model tractable? 4 This paper is a small contribution in this line of research in the wake of these benchmark models. In two previous papers we have studied two transitional models. Olaizola and Valenciano (2014) introduces a model that integrates Bala and Goyal’s one-way and two-way flow models without decay as particular extreme cases of a more general one. Olaizola and Valenciano (2015 a) provides a new hybrid model which has a variant of Jackson and Wolinsky’s connections model without decay and Bala and Goyal’s two-way flow model as extreme cases. The point {{of this paper is to}} complete the “triangle”, i.e. to provide and study a transitional model between the remaining pair: the variant of Jackson and Wolinsky’s model without decay and Bala and Goyal’s one-way flow model as extreme cases. To achieve this we assume that a link resulting from collaboration of two agents provides a better channel of transmission than a link sponsored by only one agent. As this “side” of the triangle has a common “vertex” with that studied in Olaizola and Valenciano (2015 a), i.e. Jackson and Wolinsky’s model without decay, this transition provides a point of comparison with the results for efficiency, stability, and dynamics in that transitional model. In particular, this evidences the different impact on efficiency and stability of assuming the feasibility of different types of unilateral link—undirected and directed—giving rise to different externalities. To shorten the paper by avoiding redundancies whenever the results essentially coincide we omit the proofs and emphasize the differences.|$|R
30|$|Different from {{structural}} permeability, in {{our work}} we consider two peculiar constraints derived from empirical observations that fundamentally change the approach. The first is {{on the nature of}} <b>admissible</b> direct <b>actions</b> operated on driver nodes, while the second is on the possibility to engage optimal driver nodes. With respect to the nature of direct actions, we assume that in a social context no explicit direct action controlling the behavior of individuals is possible unless a contract is enforced, like establishing a sponsorship or signing for a professional service. Indirect <b>actions</b> are instead <b>admissible</b> by exposing individuals to new information, either random information or recommendations, {{which may or may not}} produce a change in future activities. We have considered the effects of random information enlarging the knowledge base of driver nodes as a control strategy. With the second constraint, we question the assumption, common in structural/pinning control and network permeability, that the minimal and optimal set of driver nodes could be practically engaged for network control actions. We observe instead that there are situations where this is not the case, one of the more common is when driver nodes charge a fee for propagating control actions to their neighbors, for example if they are celebrities or so-called ‘influencers’ in a social network because of their centrality. In these cases, the price for enrolling a driver node could be high and budget constraints could restrict their engagement to a suboptimal number. It is even conceivable that the price tag that network celebrities would impose could be so high that in practice none of the driver nodes that control theory would prescribe can be actually enrolled. On the contrary, the opposite strategy could become feasible: To enroll as driver nodes a large number of nodes with limited ability to propagate control actions, such as common users and lay people, which however may have unit cost almost irrelevant and could be addressable in bulk through mass campaigns. This is the common scenario for propaganda and mass manipulation through a popular media and, anecdotally, a strategy that has proved effective in several historical occasions.|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} Markov decision chains {{endowed with}} the risk-sensitive average cost criterion, {{and the main}} goals are to characterize the optimal value function and to determine an optimal stationary policy. The exposition begins in Chapter 1 where the notion of Markov decision chain is introduced, and the ideas of risk-aversion and risk–sensitivity coefficient are briefly discussed. After this point, the risk-sensitive average cost criterion is formulated, and the main objectives are formally stated. Next, in Chapter 2 a fundamental theorem by Howard and Matheson (1972), {{as well as a}} recent extension on the characterization of the optimal average cost in terms of a single optimality equation are analyzed; such results require that, under the action of any stationary policy, every state can be visited with positive probability regardless of the initial sate, and the arguments used in this work emphasize the central role of that communication property. The presentation continues in Chapter 3 studying a recent theorem on the existence of solutions to the optimality equation for ‘small’values of the risk-sensitivity coefficient, which was derived under the assumption that there exists a state that can be always reached with positive probability under the action of any stationary policy; the derivation presented in this work highlights the fundamental role of such an accessibility condition. The conclusions in Chapters 2 and 3 provide the motivation to pursue the main objective of this thesis, namely, to establish a characterization of the optimal risk-sensitive average cost without imposing any condition on the structure of the transition law of the model. This goal is achieved in Chapter 4, where the optimal risk-sensitive average cost function is characterized for general controlled Markov chains with finite state space and compact action sets, a result that is the main contribution of this thesis. It is supposed that the decision maker is risk-averse with constant risk-sensitivity coefficient and, under standard continuity–compactness conditions, it is proved that the (possibly non-constant) optimal value function is characterized by a nested system of equations, generalizing the conclusions s presented in the previous chapters, which require communication conditions on the transition law; moreover, it is shown that an optimal stationary policy can be derived form a solution of that system, and that the optimal superior and inferior limit average cost functions coincide. The approach used to obtain the main conclusions relies on the discounted method which, roughly, consists in using a family of contractive operators whose fixed points are used to approximate the optimal average index, to partition the state space in a family of equivalence classes, to determine a class of <b>admissible</b> <b>actions</b> at each state, and to construct a solution of a ‘reduced’ optimality equation on each equivalence class; the presentation of these results is based on the recent paper Alanís Durán and Cavazos-Cadena (2012). Finally, the exposition concludes in Chapter 5 with a retrospective view of the material presented in this work, and with the statement of two open problems concerning the extension of some of the conclusions in this work to models with denumerable state space...|$|R
