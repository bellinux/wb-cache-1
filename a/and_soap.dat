30|$|In this study, sixty-two (62) skin-lightening creams <b>and</b> <b>soaps</b> were {{analysed}} for total mercury and hydroquinone levels. Total mercury {{was determined by}} the Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry using an automatic mercury analyser and hydroquinone by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The mean concentration of total mercury in skin toning creams <b>and</b> cosmetic <b>soaps</b> were 0.098  ±  0.082 and 0.152  ±  0.126  μg/g, respectively. The mean concentration of hydroquinone was 0.243  ±  0.385 and 0.035  ±  0.021  % in skin toning creams <b>and</b> cosmetic <b>soaps,</b> respectively. All the creams <b>and</b> <b>soaps</b> analysed had mercury and hydroquinone levels below the US Food and Drug Administration’s acceptable limit of 1  μg/g and 2  %, respectively. The low levels of mercury and hydroquinone in the creams <b>and</b> <b>soaps</b> analysed in this study therefore do not pose any potential risk to consumers who are mostly women in Ghana.|$|R

If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water <b>and</b> <b>soap,</b> but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted.

5|$|Caspar David Friedrich {{was born}} on 5 September 1774, in Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania, on the Baltic coast of Germany. The sixth of ten children, he {{was brought up in}} the strict Lutheran creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a candle-maker <b>and</b> <b>soap</b> boiler. Records of the family's {{financial}} circumstances are contradictory; while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in relative poverty. Caspar David was familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie Dorothea Bechly, died in 1781 when he was just seven. A year later, his sister Elisabeth died, while a second sister, Maria, succumbed to typhus in 1791. Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother Johann Christoffer died: at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake, and drown. Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.|$|E
5|$|In 1556 the sheikdom {{was led by}} Sheikh Abu Rayyan bin Sheikh Manna, who was {{succeeded by}} Sheikh Muhammad Abu Rabban in 1560.

The Ottomans imposed taxes on olive oil, wheat and barley, and the sheikh was responsible for paying the revenues of collected taxes to the Ottoman authorities. In addition, Bani Zeid was required to finance a waqf (religious endowment) to the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In 1596 both Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima appeared in Ottoman tax registers and both villages paid taxes on wheat, barley, olive trees, fruit trees, vineyards, goats and/or beehives. Deir Ghassaneh had a population of 76 households, all Muslim, while Beit Rima had 54 Muslim households and 14 Christian households. During {{the course of the}} 16th century, most of Beit Rima's Christian inhabitants had emigrated from the village to Jerusalem, Ramla and Gaza, although the Christian population that remained continued to grow.|$|E
