40|$|NoWhich is better, {{a visual}} or an <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal?</b> Initial {{findings}} suggested that an auditory signal was more effective, speeding {{reaction to a}} target more than a visual warning signal, particularly at brief foreperiods [Bertelson, P., & Tisseyre, F. (1969). The time-course of preparation: confirmatory results with visual and auditory warning signals. Acta Psychologica, 30. In W. G.

G. Koster (Ed.), Attention and Performance II (pp. 155 - 167) ]. This led to the hypothesis that an auditory signal is more alerting than a visual warning signal [Sanders, A. F. (1975).

The present study conducted six experiments to understand the cause of these conflicting findings. The results suggest that an <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> is not more effective than a visual warning signal. Previous reports of an auditory superiority appear to have been caused by using different locations for the visual warning signal and visual target, resulting in the target arriving at an unattended location when the foreperiod was brief.

However, it is also suggested that previous measures of the modality shift effect may still have been confounded by a location cuing effect...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} series of three {{experiments}} designed to assess the relative speed with which people can initiate speeded head-orienting responses following the presentation of spatial warning signals. Background: Recent cognitive neuroscience findings have shown that the human brain tends to treat stimuli occurring in peripersonal space as being somehow more behaviorally relevant and attention demanding than stimuli occurring in extrapersonal space. These brain mechanisms may be exploited in the design of warning signals. Method: Experiment 1 assessed the effectiveness of various different unisensory warning signals in eliciting a head-turning response to look at the potential source of danger requiring participants' immediate attention; Experiment 2 assessed the latency of a driver's responses to events occurring in the cued direction; Experiment 3 assessed the relative effectiveness of various warning signals in reorienting a person's gaze back to a central driving task while he or she was distracted by a secondary task. Results: The results show that participants initiated head-turning movements and made speeded discrimination or braking responses significantly more rapidly following the presentation of a close rear <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> than following the presentation of either a far frontal <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> a vibrotactile warning signal presented to their waist, or a peripheral visual warning signal. Conclusion: These results support the claim that the introduction of peripersonal warning signals results in a significant performance advantage relative to traditionally designed warnings. Application: Warning systems that have been designed around the constraints of the human brain offer great potential in the future design of multisensory interfaces.

40|$|Auditory signals {{have proven}} useful to guide and inform drivers in {{dangerous}} situations. Sounds can become annoying, however, thereby negatively affecting consumer acceptance of an interface or system. Auditory warnings are typically salient sounds such as sudden beeps or repetitive tones.

The present study explored the usefulness of three alternative strategies to notify drivers in early stages of a threatening situation using sound: 1. panning the radio sound from the driver’s position (equal sound level in both ears) to one side; 2. reducing the sound level of the radio; and 3. a mild <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> (i. e., an added sound). The participants responded to the early warnings in a simple reaction task while performing a simulated driving task.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect that an auditory collision warning signal's pulse rate, pulse pattern, and onset distance had on subject braking responses in a simulated crane/overhead power line collision scenario. The experimental warning signal alerted subjects of their proximity to overhead power lines. The experimental taks required subjects to monitor a simulated auditory collision warning signal while simultaneously operating a single-axis driving simulation task. The driving task simulated an actual crane operator's mental workload required to navigate a crane and manipulate various loads. Subjects were required to initiate braking responses {{based on the information}} conveyed solely through the auditory collision warning system. No visual information was provided to the subjects to isolate the effects of the warning signal. Subjective ratings of the auditory warning signals were obtained to compare subjects'actual performance using the warning signal versus their subjective preferences. Results indicate that subjects were able to initiate appropriate braking responses while using an auditory collision warning signal with moderate onset distances and low pulse rates. The auditory pulse pattern did not have a large impact on subjects'braking responses except at extremely short onset distances.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{follow-up}} {{study was to investigate}} the course of performance in attentional tasks in children with ADHD and normal controls in late childhood and preadolescence over short periods of time. The development of two dimensions of attention was compared: alertness/arousal and inhibitory control. METHOD: Children with ADHD (N= 28) and normal controls (N= 25) were examined at three times: at baseline (age mean= 10. 8 years, SD= 1. 5), after one year (age mean= 12. 0 years, SD= 1. 6), and after 2. 6 years (age mean= 13. 3 years, SD= 1. 6). They performed two tasks of a computerized battery for attentional performance: Alertness [...] a test of simple reaction time to visual stimuli contrasting a condition with and without <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> and Incompatibility [...] a test of spatial interference/inhibitory control. Clinical diagnosis according to DSM-III-R criteria was established at time 1 and time 3 by structured diagnostic interviews. RESULTS: In the Alertness task significant group differences regarding increased reaction time variability in ADHD, but not for reaction time itself, were found at time 1 and more pronounced at time 2. At time 3 group differences had disappeared. In the Incompatibility task group differences in number of errors were not observed at time 1, whereas children with ADHD made significantly more errors at time 2 and less pronounced at time 3. The degree of clinical symptom remission after 2. 6 years was not related to changes in neuropsychological performance. CONCLUSION: When measuring attentional functions, the selection of an appropriate time window seems to be essential for the detection of group differences between ADHD children and controls, because group differences are most pronounced before adolescence. The different developmental course of selective components of attention should be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The gap effect {{refers to}} the finding that saccadic latencies are {{typically}} reduced when a fixation point is removed prior to {{the appearance of a}} peripheral target. This reduction in saccadic reaction time (SacRT) is thought to be due to a general warning effect and an oculomotor specific fixation offset that occur when the fixation point is removed. In order to estimate the contribution of each of these effects to the overall gap effect, this paper introduces a new manipulation, the partial-gap trial, where the fixation point undergoes a change in size prior to the presentation of the target. The partial-gap trial is presumed to provide the visual warning effect of the fixation offset (i. e. similar to that in a gap trial) but does not provide the fixation offset effect (FOE). When the fixation point was abruptly reduced in size before the presentation of the target, the estimated decrease in SacRT due to the visual warning effect was 5 – 7 % and did not differ in {{the presence or absence of}} an <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> It was found that auditory warning effect and the FOE interacted in reducing SacRTs. Additionally, when the fixation point was abruptly increased in size before the presentation of the target, SacRTs were slower than when the fixation point did not change in size and remained present for the entire trial (i. e. an overlap trial). We conclude that this new partial-gap paradigm is a useful method for researchers wishing to separately examine FOE and visual warning effects.

This simulator experiment is a preliminary study examining the effects of different auditory signals on braking force and reaction time in a rear-end collision warning system. A driving simulator was built in which subjects operated a computer driving game. Superimposed on the game screen was the image of a car which appeared to the driver to be ahead of him/her. The image enlarged in size, appearing to be a car applying its brakes. The participant was instructed to react as he would in a real driving situation by applying his/her brakes. Closing velocities of 10 miles per hour and 30 miles per hour were used. Braking times and forces were measured for four different warning sounds: 1) no warning; 2) a pulsed warning sound that increased in repetition rate; 3) a sound that increased in frequency; and, 4) a sound that increased in intensity. Results suggested that an <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> would decrease reaction time and increase maximum braking force applied. The sound that increased in frequency and the sound that increased in intensity provided the greatest savings in reaction time, approximately one quarter second, when compared to the no warning condition.

Subjects repeatedly underwent backward postural disturbance by a forward floor translation (S 2) 2 [*]s after an <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> (S 1). Initial and second sets were conducted, each set with 20 trials. Posterior peak {{position of the}} center of pressure in the anteroposterior direction (CoPy) after S 2 was identified. Electroencephalograms from Cz were averaged for each set, and the CNV negative peak was identified. Results Compared with the first trial, the posterior peak position of CoPy changed significantly forward from the 12 th trial in the young and from the 19 th trial in the elderly during the initial set. The mean of the posterior peak position was more forward in second set than in the initial set for both groups and was significantly backward in the elderly compared to the young for both sets. These findings indicate that subjects in both groups adapted better to the postural disturbance in the second set than in the initial set, and the adaptation was later in the elderly. Late CNV in the young started to increase negatively {{from the middle of the}} S 1 -S 2 period and peaked just before S 2. Peak CNV amplitude was larger in the second set than in the initial set. In contrast, late CNV in the elderly exhibited no negative increase as in the young and peaked in the middle of the S 1 -S 2 period, which was followed by gradual decreasing toward S 2. No adaptive changes were found in late CNV for the elderly. Conclusions It is conceivable that reduced activation of the frontal lobe may be one of the factors contributing to the decrease in postural adaptability in the elderly. The elderly may use various brain regions for the adaptation of dynamic postural control compared with the young. </p...|$|E
40|$|Auditory {{warnings}} {{are often}} used to direct a user’s attention from a primary task to critical peripheral events. In the context of traffic, in-vehicle collision avoidance systems could, for example, employ spatially relevant sounds to alert the driver to the possible presence of a crossing pedestrian. This raises the question: What is an effective auditory alert in a steering environment? Ideally, such warning signals should not only arouse the driver but also result in deeper processing of {{the event that the}} driver is being alerted to. Warning signals can be designed to convey the time to contact with an approaching object (Gray, 2011). That is, sounds can rise in intensity in accordance with the physical velocity of an approaching threat. The current experiment was a manual steering task in which participants were occasionally required to recognized peripheral visual targets. These visual targets were sometimes preceded by a spatially congruent <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> This was either a sound with constant intensity, linearly rising intensity, or non-linearly rising intensity that conveyed time-to-contact. To study the influence of warning cues on the arousal state, different features of electroencephalography (EEG) were measured. Alpha frequency, which ranges from 7. 5 to 12. 5 Hz, is believed to represent different cognitive processes, in particular arousal (Klimesch, 1999). That is, greater desynchronization in the alpha frequency reflects higher levels of attention as well as alertness. Our results showed a significant decrease in alpha power for sounds with rising intensity profiles, indicating increased alertness and expectancy for an event to occur. To analyze whether the increased arousal for rising sounds resulted in deeper processing of the visual target, we analyzed the event related potential P 3. It is a positive component that occurs approximately 300 ms after an event and is known to be associated with recognition performance of a stimulus (Parasuraman Beatty, 1980). In other words, smaller P 3 amplitudes indicate worse identification than larger amplitudes. Our results show that sounds with time-to-contact properties induced larger P 3 responses to the targets that they cued compared to targets cued by constant or linearly rising sounds. This suggests that rising sounds with time-to-contact intensity profiles evoke deeper processing of the visual target and therefore result in better identification than events cued by sounds with linearly rising or constant intensity...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that urgent <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings</b> are likely to annoy drivers. Increased urgency could also raise drivers’ stress levels, which in turn could impact their ability to detect and react to subsequent changes in the traffic environment. We conducted a simulator experiment with 24 truck drivers to investigate the potential of urgent alarms to raise annoyance and negatively affect drivers’ subsequent responses to unrelated, critical events on the road. The drivers received two types of warnings that were designed to significantly differ in perceived urgency. Several times in the trial, an unexpected event occurred just seconds after drivers were presented with an unrelated warning, and the drivers had to brake immediately to avoid a collision. The results indicate that acoustic characteristics and semantic meaning may impact the perceived annoyance of in-vehicle warnings. Interestingly, we found a significant, negative correlation between the drivers’ experience (years of truck driving experience) and the rated annoyance for both types of warnings. Also, the drivers who received the high-urgency warning braked significantly harder and tended to brake later than the drivers who received a low-urgency warning.

However, little is known about what occurs for spatial interactions between these two extremes. We systematically varied the separation between cues and targets to quantify the spatial distribution of crossmodal attention. The orthogonal cueing paradigm [Spence et al. 1998] was used. Visual targets presented above or below the forearm were preceded by either vibrotactile cues presented on the forearm, auditory cues presented below the forearm, or visual cues presented on the forearm. The presentation of both unimodal and crossmodal cues led to a roughly monotonic increase in RT {{as a function of the}} cue-target separation. Unimodal visual cueing resulted in an attentional focus that was significantly narrower than that produced by crossmodal cues: the distribution of visual attention for visual cues had roughly half of the lateral extent of that produced by tactile cueing and roughly one fourth of the lateral extent as that produced by auditory cueing. This occurred when both seven (Experiment 1) and three (Experiment 2) cue locations were used suggesting that the effects are not primarily due to differences in the ability to localize the cues. These findings suggest that the location of tactile and <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> does not have to be controlled as precisely as the location of visual <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> to facilitate a response to the critical visual event...|$|R

40|$|The {{audibility}} and {{the identification}} of 23 auditory alarms {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) and 26 auditory alarms in the operating rooms (ORs) of a 214 -bed Canadian teaching hospital were investigated. Digital tape recordings of the alarms were made and analyzed using masked-threshold software. The digital recordings were also presented to the hospital personnel responsible for monitoring these alarms on an individual basis in order to determine how many of the alarms they would be able to identify when they heard them. Several of the alarms in both areas of the hospital could mask other alarms in the same area, and many of the alarms in the operating rooms could be masked by the sound of a surgical saw or a surgical drill. The staff in the OR (anesthetists, anesthesia residents, and OR technologists) were able to identify a mean of between 10 and 15 of the 26 alarms found in their operating theatres. The ICU nurses were able to identify a mean of between 9 and 14 of the 23 alarms found in their ICU. Alarm importance was positively correlated with the frequency of alarm identification in the case of the OR, but was not significantly correlated in the case of the ICU. This study demonstrates the poor design of <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in hospitals and the need for standardization of alarms on medical equipment...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the presentation of spatially predictive <b>auditory</b> and vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> can facilitate driver responses to driving events seen through the windscreen or rearview mirror. The present study investigated whether this facilitation reflects the priming of the appropriate response (i. e. braking vs. accelerating) or an attentional cuing effect (i. e. a perceptual benefit that facilitates subsequent behavioural responding). In the experiments reported here, participants had to discriminate the colour of a number plate (red vs. blue) following the presentation of either spatially predictive vibrotactile (experiment 1) or <b>auditory</b> (experiment 2) <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> that indicated the likely location (front or back) of the visual target, while simultaneously performing a highly attention-demanding rapid serial visual presentation task. Numberplate discrimination performance was facilitated following the presentation of valid auditory cues, but not following the presentation of equally informative vibrotactile cues. The use of an orthogonal spatial cuing design enabled with us to rule out of a potential response priming account of these data. The results suggest that whilst directional congruency between a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> and a target event may be sufficient to facilitate performance due to the priming of the appropriate response, attentional facilitation effects may also require the co-location of the cue and target within the same functional region of space. © 2006 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Semantic <b>auditory</b> icons as <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> <b>Auditory</b> icons with {{additional}} semantic {{information in the}} context of collision warnings will be tested in a driving simulator and for this reason methodological questions shall be discussed. <b>Auditory</b> icons as <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> can lead to fast responses, but in some cases they can also elicit inadequate behaviour (Graham, 1999; Ulfvengren, 2003). Stevens, Brennan & Parker (2004) have shown the potential benefit of “enriching ” auditory icons with information by manipulating acoustic parameters in a laboratory setting. An example is variation of frequency to induce the impression of size. An interesting question is whether benefits realized in the laboratory also arise in a more realistic setting, such as a driving simulator. Therefore the objective of my first study is to test the ability of auditory icons with enriched additional information (distance and direction) in leading to fast and adequate responses when used as collision warnings in a realistic driving scenario. In a pilot study, several auditory icons were chosen which will be used in a simulator study. The next step in designing the simulator study is to generate collision situations and to map these with appropriate auditory icons. I would like to discuss the following aspects...|$|R
40|$|Based on four studies, {{this thesis}} aims {{to explore how}} to design <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> that can {{facilitate}} safer driving by operators of heavy goods vehicles. The first three studies focus on the relationships between certain characteristics of <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings</b> and various indicators of traffic safety. A deeper understanding of these relationships would allow system developers to design auditory signals that are better optimised for safety. The fourth study examines the opinions of both vehicle developers and professional drivers regarding warning attributes. One major conclusion is that meaningful warning sounds {{that are related to}} the critical event can improve safety. As compared with arbitrarily mapped sounds, meaningful sounds are easier to learn, can improve drivers’ situation awareness, and generate less interference and less annoyance. The present thesis also supports the view that commercial drivers’ initial acceptance of these sounds may be very high. Annoyance is an especially important aspect of warning design to consider; it can negatively influence driving performance and may lead drivers to turn off their warning systems. This research supports the notion that drivers do not consider that negative experience is an appropriate attribute of <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings</b> designed to increase their situation awareness. Also, commercial drivers seem to report, significantly more than vehicle developers, that having less-annoying <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings</b> is important in high-urgency driving situations. Furthermore, the studies presented in this thesis indicate that annoyance cannot be predicted based on the physical properties of the warning alone. Learned meaning, appropriateness of the mapping between a warning and a critical event, and individual differences between drivers may also significantly influence levels of annoyance. Arousal has been identified as an important component of driver reactions to <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings.</b> However, high levels of arousal can lead to a narrowing of attention, which would be suboptimal for critical situations during which drivers need to focus on several ongoing traffic events. The present work supports the notion that high-urgency warnings can influence commercial drivers’ responses to unexpected peripheral events (i. e., those that are unrelated to the warning) in terms of response force, but not necessarily in terms of response time. The types of <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings</b> that will be developed for future vehicles depend not only on advances in research, but also on the opinions of developers and drivers. The present research shows that both vehicle developers and drivers are aware of several of the potentially important characteristics of <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings.</b> For example, they both recognise that warnings should be easy to understand. However, they do disagree regarding certain attributes of warnings, and, furthermore, developers may tend to employ a “better safe than sorry” strategy (by neglecting factors concerning annoyance and the elicitation of severe startled responses) when designing high-urgency warnings. Developers’ recognition of the potentially important attributes of <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings</b> should positively influence the future development of in-vehicle systems. However, considering the current state of research regarding in-vehicle warnings, it remains challenging to predict the most suitable sounds for specific warning functions. One recommendation is to develop a design process that examines the appropriateness of in-vehicle <b>auditory</b> <b>warnings.</b> This thesis suggests an initial version of such a process, which in this case was produced in collaboration with system designers working in the automotive industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Noise is omnipresent and impacts {{us all in}} {{many aspects}} of daily living. Noise can {{interfere}} with communication not only in industrial workplaces, but also in other work settings (e. g. open-plan offices, construction, and mining) and within buildings (e. g. residences, arenas, and schools). The interference of noise with communication can have significant social consequences, especially for persons with hearing loss, and may compromise safety (e. g. failure to perceive <b>auditory</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signals),</b> influence worker productivity and learning in children, affect health (e. g. vocal pathology, noise-induced hearing loss), compromise speech privacy, and impact social participation by the elderly. For workers, {{attempts have been made}} to: 1) Better define the auditory performance needed to function effectively and to directly measure these abilities when assessing Auditory Fitness for Duty, 2) design hearing protection devices that can improve speech understanding while offering adequate protection against loud noises, and 3) improve speech privacy in open-plan offices. As the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the effects of noise, an understanding of the interplay between auditory, cognitive, and social factors and its effect on speech communication and social participation is also critical. Classroom acoustics and speech intelligibility in children have also gained renewed interest because of the importance of effective speech comprehension in noise on learning. Finally, substantial work has been made in developing models aimed at better predicting speech intelligibility. Despite progress in various fields, the design of alarm signals continues to lag behind advancements in knowledge. This summary of the last three years′ research highlights some of the most recent issues for the workplace, for older adults, and for children, as well as the effectiveness of warning sounds and models for predicting speech intelligibility. Suggestions for future work are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: An {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} efficacy of <b>auditory</b> icons as <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in an aviation context. Background: Iconic signals, such as a cough to signal dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, convey information {{about the nature of}} an incident and alert the operator that there is a problem, whereas signals that are arbitrarily associated with a critical incident provide relatively less information. Warning recognition speed and accuracy are likely to be influenced by modality of presentation (visual, auditory, auditory + visual) and task demand (low, high). Methods: The 172 participants completed a computer-based training session and test task that involved responding to abstract or iconic auditory (1 s), visual, or <b>auditory</b> + visual <b>warnings</b> associated with seven critical incidents while performing low- and high-demand concurrent tasks. Results: Significantly fewer training trials were required to learn iconic warnings than abstract warnings. An advantage for iconic warnings persisted into the test phase, evident most consistently as greater warning recognition accuracy. The effect was observed in both high- and low-demand conditions. <b>Auditory</b> abstract <b>warnings,</b> in particular, elicited slow reaction times and poor accuracy. Conclusion: Associations between a small number of meaningful environmental sounds and critical incidents can be learned with ease relative to more abstract associations, although training is required and response times are relatively slow. Application: Sets of distinctive <b>auditory</b> iconic <b>warnings</b> can be designed to alert and inform pilots about non-time-pressured events. Potential applications of language-neutral icons as informative warnings include civil, commercial, and defense aircraft. 11 page(s...|$|R
