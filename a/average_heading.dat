40|$|Abstract: This paper {{pertains}} to the reduction of measurement errors due to drift in rate gyros used for tracking the position of moving vehicles. In these applications, gyros and odometry are often used to augment GPS when GPS reception is unavailable. Drift in gyros causes the unbounded growth of errors in the estimation of heading, rendering lowcost gyros almost entirely useless in applications that require good accuracy {{for more than just}} a few seconds or minutes. Our proposed method, called “Heuristic Drift Reduction” (HDR), applies a unique closed-loop control system approach to estimate drift in real-time and remove the estimated drift instantaneously from the gyro reading. The paper presents results of experiments, in which a gyro-equipped car was driven hundreds of miles on highways, rural roads, and city streets.

40|$|Pedestrian dead {{reckoning}} (PDR) {{is widely used}} for indoor localisation. Its principle is to recursively update {{the location of the}} pedestrian by using step length and step heading. A common method to estimate the heading in PDR is to use magnetometer measurements. However, unlike outdoor environments, the Earth’s magnetic field is strongly perturbed inside buildings making the magnetometer measurements unreliable for heading estimation. This paper presents a new method to reduce heading estimation errors when magnetometers are used. The method consists of two components. The first component uses a machine learning algorithm to detect whether a heading estimate is within a specific error margin. Only heading estimates within the error margin are retained and passed to the second component, while the other estimates are discarded. The second component uses data fusion to average the heading estimates from multiple people walking in the same direction. The rationale of this component is based on the observation that magnetic perturbations are often highly localised in space and if multiple people are walking in the same direction, then only some of their magnetometers are likely to be perturbed. Data fusion between users can be carried out in a distributed manner by using a consensus algorithm with information sharing over wireless links. We tested the performance of our method using 92 datasets. The method is shown to provide an <b>average</b> <b>heading</b> estimate error of approximately 2 °, which is more than 6 -fold lower than the error of the heading estimate based only on raw magnetometer measurements (without any filtering and fusion). Assuming highly accurate step-length observation, the improved heading estimation leads to an average localisation accuracy of 55 cm, which is an 80 % improvement over PDR localisation using only raw magnetometer measurements...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{winter wheat}} {{identification}} and phenology extraction {{are essential for}} field management and agricultural policy making. Here, we present mechanisms of winter wheat discrimination and phenological detection in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) region using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained by calculating the surface reflectance in red and infrared. We used the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth time series NDVI curves. We adopted a two-step classification to identify winter wheat. The first step was designed to mask out non-vegetation classes, and the second step aimed to identify winter wheat from other vegetation based on its phenological features. We used the double Gaussian model and the maximum curvature method to extract phenology. Due to {{the characteristics of the}} time-series profiles for winter wheat, a double Gaussian function method was selected to fit the temporal profile. A maximum curvature method was performed to extract phenological phases. Phenological phases such as the green-up, heading and harvesting phases were detected when the NDVI curvature exhibited local maximum values. The extracted phenological dates then were validated with records of the ground observations. The spatial patterns of phenological phases were investigated. This study concluded that, for winter wheat, the accuracy of classification is 87. 07 %, and the accuracy of planting acreage is 90. 09 %. The phenological result was comparable to the ground observation at the municipal level. The average green-up date for the whole region occurred on March 5, the <b>average</b> <b>heading</b> date occurred on May 9, and the average harvesting date occurred on June 5. The spatial distribution of the phenology for winter wheat showed a significant gradual delay from the southwest to the northeast.

40|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of {{environmental}} factors on crop phenology is significant in predicting crop growth stages, agricultural decision-making, and yield estimation. Here, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time-series data, we present phenological detection mechanisms and {{an explanation for the}} phenological variability linked to environmental drivers, such as cumulative temperature and soil salinity, for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Yellow River Delta in 2013. The 8 -day normalized difference vegetation index was fitted to a double Gaussian function. Phenological phases, such as the green-up and heading phases, were extracted using maximum curvature approaches. The spatial characteristics of the phenological patterns were investigated. The relationships between the phenological phases and cumulative temperature were explored. Then, the relationships between the phenological phases and soil salinity were evaluated by selecting sites with similar soil fertility and temperature forcing. This study concluded that the regional average green-up date occurred on 5 March, and the regional <b>average</b> <b>heading</b> date occurred on 9 May. The spatial distributions of the green-up and heading phases showed a gradual delay from the southwest to the northeast and from the south to the north. The green-up phase lagged 4 - 5 days for every 10 degree days that the cumulative temperature decreased. The heading phase lagged 1 - 2 days for every 10 degree days that the cumulative temperature decreased. The green-up phase in a non-salinization region might be approximately 5 - 9 days earlier than that in a severe or moderate salinization region. The heading phase in a severe region might occur approximately 1 - 8 days earlier than that in a non-salinization or moderate salinization region. The method proposed in this article may be useful for understanding {{the impact of}} temperature and soil salinity on phenology and could be used to better manage winter wheat in coastal salinization areas...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Four {{winter wheat}} cultivars, Bezostaya, Maris-Hobbit, Roussalka and Stephens, {{selected}} {{on the basis}} of the diversity of their pedigree and phenotype, were planted at Hyslop Experiment Station near Corvallis in Western Oregon to study their performance at three different row spacings (10, 16 and 24 cm), three seeding rates (100, 160, and 240 Kg/ha) and at two seeding dates (October 13 and November 12). A similar experiment was conducted at the Sherman Experiment Station, Moro in Eastern Oregon, using only two winter wheat cultivars, Stephens and Jackmar. Data were obtained on grain yield, tillers and spikes per square meter, heading and anthesis date, plant height, kernels per spike, 1000 kernel weight, test weight and harvest index. At Hyslop Experiment Station, Stephens, Bezostaya and Roussalka produced maximum grain yield at 10 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha seeding rate, and Maris-Hobbit at 24 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha seeding rate. At Sherman Experiment Station, 30 cm row spacing and 90 Kg/ha seeding rate constitutes the best combination for Stephens, and 30 cm row spacing and 120 Kg/ha seeding rate for the club wheat Jackmar. The interaction between row spacings x cultivars and seeding rates x cultivars indicated that all the cultivars produced high numbers of tillers and spikes per m² at narrow (10 cm) row spacing and high (240 Kg/ha) seeding rate. There were no significant differences between row spacings for heading and anthesis date. Lower seeding rate resulted in later heading date. The cultivar Roussalka was the earliest and Maris-Hobbit the latest in <b>average</b> <b>heading</b> date, Plant height decreased with increased row spacing and increased with increased seeding rate. The plants of the four cultivars were shorter at the second date than at the first. More kernels per spike were produced at the second than at the first date. An increase in seeding rates was accompanied by a decrease in the number of kernels per spike. There were no significant differences between the three row spacings, the three seeding rates and the four cultivars for test weight. The different row spacings and seeding rates did not affect the TOGO kernel weight. Considering the cultivars, Stephens produced a higher 1000 kernel weight at the two seeding dates than Maris- Hobbit, Bezostaya and Roussalka...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The {{yellow fever}} mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is a vector for {{numerous}} diseases, including Dengue fever, Chikungunya, and yellow fever. Efforts to minimize transmission {{of this disease}} focus on minimizing vector-host interactions, with a centralized effort to elucidate strategies employed to effectively locate hosts via windborne cues. Efforts to understand how host-emitted plumes are navigated focus on olfaction. While olfaction allows for easily controlled stimuli and robust behavioral response, {{it is not the}} only sensory modality employed during host localization. Indeed, deterrents that inhibit olfactory detection do not fully inhibit host localization. Mosquitoes are well endowed with many sensory receptors for several sensory modalities, including thermosensation. I present a series of experiments that examine and describe plume navigation in response to convective thermal plumes. Female mosquitoes were flown in a wind tunnel (1 m long x 0. 26 m wide x 0. 26 m tall) with a constant wind speed of 0. 5 ± 0. 05 m s- 1, and either no thermal signal, or a lateralized (left or right) thermal plume present. The heating elements of these plumes were modified such that radiative signal was minimized, resulting in stimulus comprised of only convective thermal signal at distances where behaviors were measured. These thermal plumes were turbulent in structure, and produced temperature differences of up to 6 °C. We defined the location and boundaries of these plumes using a mathematical model based on temperature differences, flow speed, and rates at which the plume mixed in external air. I show, for the first time, that mosquitoes navigate toward thermal sources using only convective signals. The plume navigation behavior is described by a bias to the crosswind (lateral) position of the plume source (p < 0. 01), and is achieved by augmenting the ratio of left and right turns during flight. A trend of slowly shifting, or sometimes oscillating, the <b>average</b> <b>heading</b> of the trajectory was also found, and may suggest another thermonavigation strategy. Large scale effects such as these were seen, however no change in distributions or features of kinematics (e. g. velocity, acceleration) were seen. To determine whether such slight changes or biases in kinematics can produce these large scale behaviors by creating an agent based model of mosquito flight. Features of mosquito navigation were approximated by modeling flight as a biased random walk in a driven damped mass system. The model was trained on control (plume absent) behavior, and tested with the presence of the plume, which was represented as a binary signal at the position of the empirical plumes. We defined a stimulus bias as a slight bias toward the last crosswind position a plume was detected, and faster upwind velocities while within the plume bounds. The agent model did not produce the control crosswind distributions, but did produce crosswind position distributions similar to those observed in mosquito behavior, and had similar kinematics in and outside of the plume boundaries. These experiments demonstrate that mosquitoes, when presented a turbulent, convective thermal plume, navigate in a biased random walk, and augment the bias of the walk toward the crosswind plume location...|$|E
