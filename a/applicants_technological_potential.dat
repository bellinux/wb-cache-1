40|$|The {{abilities}} of countries {{to take advantage}} of global technological progress is currently the main growth determinant. It is especially important in the case of developed economies and the countries that concentrate on closing a development gap. As a result, there is a scientific need to make an international comparisons of countries’ <b>technological</b> <b>potential,</b> which can be useful in pointing the economies that can be considered as the leaders and the economies that make especially quick progress in the field. Thus, the main purpose of the research is the identification of the variables that influence countries’ <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> at macroeconomic level, which can be used in its measuring. The second aim of the article is the evaluation of progress obtained by “new” European Union member states. It is assumed that <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> can be treated as a latent variable. Thus, it can be measured with application of Structural Equation Models (SEM). In the research, the hypothetic SEM model was proposed for the European Union countries in the years 2008 - 2012. The model was estimated with application of seven variables sugested by Eurostat as the <b>potential</b> measures of <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> of the EU economies. The research confirmed significant influence of five of the given variables. Additionally, the research showed some progress in the field obtained by Central European countries that joined the EU after the year 2004.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{equilibrium}} model of international trade with heterogeneous firms, where countries can invest into basic research to improve their <b>technological</b> <b>potential.</b> These research investments tighten firm selection and raise the average productivity of firms in the market, thereby implying lower consumer prices and higher welfare. In an open economy, {{there is also a}} strategic investment motive since a higher <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> gives domestic firms a competitive advantage in trade. Countries tend to over-invest due to this strategic motive. There are thus welfare gains from coordinating research investments. The over-investment problem turns to an under-investment problem if there are sufficiently strong cross-country spillovers of basic research investments. public research investments, public R&D, international trade, heterogeneous firms, basic research, strategic trade policy...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{approaches to}} the definition of such categories as “scientific and technological potential” and “innovative potential” in view of their resource, structural, procedural and resultant components. The author gives a more accurate definition of the scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> through identifying its resources and orientation towards transforming abilities. On the basis of the existing methods of comparative analysis used in Russia and abroad, the author proposes a methodology for evaluating scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> in the context of regional and international comparison. The integral index is calculated {{on the basis of a}} customised information and statistical database of normalised indicators through the identification and convolution of subindices that characterise individual components of potential. These subindices include pecific indicators applied in different statistical systems, in particular, those used in Russia and the EU, which made it possible to compar the data. The article presents the result of the application of this methodology based on a comparative evaluation of the scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> of Russia (Northwestern federal district) and EU states of the Baltic region. The experimental check suggests that the methodology be further improved for future clustering of Russian and EU regions according to the level of their innovative development. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this view is to {{calculate}} the energy consumption by vehicle class of new vehicle registrations over time. For motorized road modes, rail, and vessels, this calculation takes into account of: a) the set of technologies {{that are expected to}} be introduced on vehicles (<b>technological</b> <b>potential,</b> expressed in terms of the potential fuel savings delivered by each powertrain technology); and b) the share of the available <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> that is actually used for energy efficiency (as opposed to the share used for increased vehicle size, power and, more generally, performance). Information for the air mode is entered directly in terms of energy consumption. Non-motorized transport and pipelines are not considered in this context.

40|$|AbstractSustainability {{requires}} that {{quality of life}} and resource consumption are harmonized. The use of sustainable technologies fosters their harmonization. A scenario based method has been developed for identifying sustainable technology systems on different levels of development and in different areas of human living. The developed method consists of four elements: the surrounding field scenarios, technology pool, sustainability assessment and system creation. They can be applied in various paths with different starting points. The two technology induced paths, emanating from either a system or a system element, enable the transformation of <b>technological</b> <b>potentials</b> into useful applications. The problem induced path, emanating from future framework conditions of an observed field, allows human needs to be satisfied trough <b>technological</b> <b>potentials.</b> The application shown in this paper illustrates the usage of the method's problem induced path in mobility as one area of human living. Based on three surrounding field scenarios for bicycle mobility in Berlin, technology systems for bicycle design, operation and their repair in self-help workshops are illustrated...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on a new {{methodology}} for the global assessment of wind power potential. Most of the previous works on the global assessment of the <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> of wind power have used bottom-up methodologies (e. g. Archer and Jacobson, 2005; Capps and Zender, 2010; Lu et al., 2009). Economic, ecological and other assessments have been developed, based on these technological capacities. However, this paper tries {{to show that the}} reported regional and global <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> are flawed because they do not conserve the energetic balance on Earth, violating the first principle of energy conservation (Gans et al., 2010). We propose a top-down approach, such as that in Miller et al. (2010), to evaluate the physical-geographical potential and, for the first time, to evaluate the global <b>technological</b> wind power <b>potential,</b> while acknowledging energy conservation. The results give roughly 1 TW for the top limit of the future electrical potential of wind energy. This value is much lower than previous estimates and even lower than economic and realizable potentials published for the mid-century (e. g. DeVries et al., 2007; EEA, 2009; Zerta et al., 2008).

50|$|A major {{consideration}} of the Soviet decision to undertake the operation was fear of the German economy and <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> re-acclimatizing amidst the cooperation of Soviet and German technical experts after the war, and the simultaneous desire to cultivate this <b>technological</b> <b>potential</b> for the Soviet Union's benefit (especially as it concerned the nascent rocket program thereof). In particular, A. G. Myrkin of the Soviet artillery directorate {{wrote a letter to}} the head of NKVD operations in Germany complaining about the prominence of German scientists in important state-secure work. Another possible reason for the operation was the Soviet fear of being condemned for noncompliance with Allied Control Council agreements on the liquidation of German military installations. New agreements were expected on four-power inspections of remaining German war potential, which the Soviets supported, being concerned about developments in the western zones. The operation has parallels with Allied operations such as Operation Overcast, Operation Paperclip, and Operation Alsos, in which the Allies brought military specialists, notably Wernher von Braun, from Germany (primarily to the United States).|$|R
