A threshold effect for the squeezing is found, below which the spectrum consists of an absorptive and an emissive doublet of the same width and above which the spectra consists of two partly absorptive, partly dispersive features of different widths and both centered on the squeezing frequency. It is shown that below threshold a spectral hole may appear at the probe-beam frequency separated from the atomic transition frequency by twice the detuning of the squeezed field centre frequency from <b>atom</b> <b>resonance.</b> For a minimum uncertainty squeezed field of high intensity the probe absorption can be totally suppressed at this frequency and the system is transparent for the probe beam.

40|$|Using master {{equation}} and quantum Monte Carlo wavefunction approaches, {{we study}} {{the circumstances surrounding}} the emergence and degradation of the elusive squeezing of fluctuations in two-level <b>atom</b> <b>resonance</b> fluorescence. For its measurement we suggest conditional homodyne detection (CHD) [G. T. Foster, L. A. Orozco, H. M. Castro-Beltran, H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, pp. 3149 - 3152, 2000], which is nearly independent of detector efficiencies, which have harmed previous attemps. Squeezing in resonance fluorescence requires a weak laser, so the average interval between emitted photons is much longer than the regression time to the steady state; here, the spectrum of the out-of-phase quadrature is a negative peak. In CHD, moderate fields generate a non-zero third-order correlation in the dipole fluctuations that contaminates squeezing, making the noise non- Gaussian. If the probability to emit two and even three close photons is still small the additional contribution is also negative, helping to make the full spectrum a bit larger and easier to measure. Strong driving spreads the photoemission distribution, which destroys squeezing, and the third order fluctuations become responsible for the non-classicality of the fluorescence. 8 page(s...|$|E

Complementing this conventional process, exchange spectroscopy experiments show that the β-H atom of [Cp 2 TiCH 2 CHMe(SiMe 3) ](+) undergoes exchange with the three hydrogen atoms of the β-methyl group (β-H/γ-H exchange) but not with the two α-H atoms. This exchange process is completely shut down when [Cp 2 TiCH 2 CH(CD 3) (SiMe 3) ](+) is used, suggesting an H/D kinetic isotope effect much larger (apparently > 16, 000) than the maximum possible for an over-the-barrier process.
