50|$|Since 2015, <b>Airwheel</b> {{has started}} to invest in areas like IOT sensors, {{robotics}} and deep learning {{as a part of}} their strategic expansion.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to obtain quantitative information on the shock-reducing and energy-dissipating qualities of a set of 30 by 13 - 6 Musselman type <b>airwheels.</b> The investigation consisted of static, drop, and flight tests. The static tests were made with inflation pressures of approximately 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 pounds per square inch and loadings up to 9, 600 pounds. The drop tests were with the inflation pressures approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 pounds per square inch and loadings of 1, 840, 2, 440, 3, 050, and 3, 585 pounds. The flight tests were made with VE- 7 airplane weighing 2, 153 pounds, with the tires inflated to 5, 10, and 15 pounds per square inch. The landing gears used in conjunction with <b>airwheels</b> were practically rigid structures. The results of the tests showed that the walls of the tires carried a considerable portion of the load, each tire supporting a load of 600 pounds with a depression of approximately 6 inches. The shock-reducing qualities, under severe tests, and the energy dissipating characteristics of the tires, under all tests, were poor. The latter was evidenced by the rebound present in all landings made. In the severe drop tests, the free rebound reached as much as 60 per cent of the free drop. The results indicate that a shock-reducing and energy-dissipating mechanism should be used in conjunction with <b>airwheels...</b>|$|R
50|$|S8 is the <b>Airwheel's</b> {{electrically}} powered sitting posture, hands free, scooter - ridden in {{a sitting position}} while holding. The sitting format lets the user occupy lesser space in crowd {{as opposed to the}} e-bikes and is assisted with a self balancing technology so that the rider does not have to balance on two parallel wheels as they ride it. The scooter is based on a modular design; if any one of the two modues stop working, the other one independently works.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Airwheel</b> Holding Limited is a US-based {{manufacturer}} of Personal transporters, mainly {{known for its}} [...] "intelligent electric scooter" [...] which uses the clean lithium battery.|$|E
50|$|The company's self-balancingelectric unicycle, <b>AirWheel</b> Q3, is a {{rechargeable}} {{model with}} a 20 mile range, maximum speed of 12mph and a KERS system for ‘self-charging’ while going downhill.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airwheel</b> {{was founded}} in 2004 and {{established}} its manufacturing and logistic centers in United States, Belgium and China. The company targets 168 {{countries around the world}} spanning 30 million custommers.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of its portability, {{uniqueness}} and environment friendly technology, <b>Airwheel</b> has been covered in a multitude of in-depth online reviews by the Daily Mail, the Brisbane Telegraph, Gizmodo, Tech Radar, Wired, and The Independent among others.|$|E
50|$|Seating kits are {{manufactured}} {{to be used}} with self balancing platforms like the Segway, the Ninebot and the <b>Airwheel,</b> the leading products in the mobility device market. Many of these kits are already being incorporated onto these devices. Most seat kits are available by regional distributors who can install them and customize as necessary.|$|E
50|$|An <b>airwheel</b> is {{performed}} {{when the boat}} is forced unusually deep into the water as in the loop technique and shot clear of the water, at that point, the boat is rotated through 180 degrees around an edge (as distinct from the loop which rotates about {{the deck of the}} boat), as to land on the opposite end and potentially continue cartwheeling.|$|E
50|$|Z5 is an {{electrically}} powered, motorized, 2-wheel standing scooter with upright handle, {{similar to}} a kick scooter. It is foldable like other <b>airwheel</b> series and has a modular battery design interfacable with USB ports and mobile phones to either charge the scooter or charge the mobile phone from the scooter battery. Z5 is, by design, an urban commuter and a bicycle replacement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airwheel</b> C5 is {{coupled with}} various {{functions}} to improve user experience, including {{one key to}} answer calls, HD recording and Mobile App among others. Additionally, the Bluetooth connecting the helmet to a smartphone enables riders to answer a call without having {{to take out the}} phone from pocket while riding. The product adopts an integrated technology to provide the user experience as well as the impact toughness as its primary use as safety gear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airwheel</b> E6 is an {{electrically}} powered bike designed {{for people to}} travel {{in and around the}} city. The bike is built as a light weight machine to make it a foldable e-bike for portability and to allow it to pass through narrow urban spaces and traffic jams. The bike uses a 300W motor powered by a Li-ion battery and has a double damping system for its shocks to compensate multiple load conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airwheel</b> E3 is a {{backpack}} electric bike folding bike. Smaller in size, weight 12.5kg, compared to E6, E3 can be folded into {{a backpack}} {{to be carried}} along with a suitcase. E3 is powered with a car-level Li-ion battery. Like its E6 counterpart, E3 uses aluminum alloys as the frame materials. E3 is notable in the electric scooter category and is mainly designed for urban commuting through crowd and to be carried along into the building.|$|E
50|$|Seat-kits {{were created}} {{for use with}} devices other than the Segway. These other devices are the Ninebot and the <b>Airwheel.</b> However, these seat-kits were not {{suitable}} for some people because of the required level of balance and physical core strength needed to remain stable on the seat. These seat kits didn’t include back rests or arm rests. Since the handlebars move independently from the platform, the average user would need to shift their weight with their core and steer with both hands. This is a critical problem for some users because {{they might not have}} enough core strength to control the handlebar by simply sitting, they require one hand on the armrest to shift their weight and the other hand to control the handlebars. .|$|E
