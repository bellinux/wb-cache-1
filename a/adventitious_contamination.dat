40|$|AbstractFor live, {{attenuated}} vaccines {{derived from}} neurotropic wild-type viruses, regulatory authorities require neurovirulence safety testing, typically using monkeys, {{to assure the}} absence of residual neurotoxicity. Ethical concerns surrounding the use of nonhuman primates in product testing, coupled with questions over its predictive value, {{has resulted in a}} concerted effort to replace monkey-based neurovirulence safety testing with more informative, validated alternative methods that include the use of lower animal species (e. g., mice and rats) and/or in vitro assays such as mutation analysis by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC). MAPREC is a WHO-approved screening tool to assess reversion to neurovirulence of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Monitoring the genetic consistency of OPV lots by identification and quantification of the mutational profile using the recently developed technology of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) also holds promise not only as a replacement for nonhuman primate testing of OPV lots but for other vaccines for which animal-based tests are currently performed as a measure of manufacturing consistency and freedom of <b>adventitious</b> virus <b>contamination.</b> In many cases, the greatest hurdle to availability of such alternative methods has been the process rather than the science.

With the re-moval of adventitious carbon on the surface, Si/SiO 2 ultrathin films {{can serve as}} calibration standards in vacuum ultraviolet reflectance characterization (the range from 8 to 60 nm). Our group anticipates using these standards when making a mirror that {{will be sent to}} the moon and will be used to study the earth’s magnetosphere. Data are presented for the samples that demon-strate the elimination of <b>adventitious</b> carbon <b>contamination</b> via oxygen rad-icals and chemical treatments. Data are determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Additionally, I found that the antechamber of the XPS system deposits hydrocarbon onto the surface of samples. I adapted a plasma cleaner so that it minimized the effects of this instrumental contamination. I found that samples must be cleaned with the lamp for at least five minutes or cleaned with the two-step chemical RCA clean. I found a correlation between the ellipsometry data and the XPS data. Finally I stored samples and found that carbon begins to redeposit on the sample surface within 2 hours of cleaning it. Storage data are presented.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} to correct for attenuation effects by adventitious organic contamination in quantitative XPS, The corrected intensity ratio I-X(o) /I-Y(o) involving two different substrate peaks is determined as {{the slope of}} the plot of I-X/I-C 1 s as a function of I-Y/I-C 1 s for samples covered with organic overlayers of varying thickness. The thickness of deposited organic overlayers {{does not need to be}} perfectly uniform provided that it does not vary by more than +/- 40 %. The sample surface can either be flat or present a random roughness (e. g. powders), Shadowing effects accompanying overlayer non-uniformity are taken into account by a simple model involving effective thickness and fractional coverage, which is shown to enhance greatly the accuracy of computed intensity ratios. Constraints of the method and possible implementations were examined with an NaCl powder covered with <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination,</b> polystyrene (PS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The most straightforward implementation of the method would be to record repeatedly the peaks of interest while decreasing the <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination</b> overlayer thickness by thermal desorption, The error on I-Na 2 s(o) /I-Na 1 s(o) is + 10 %, with the apparent overlayer thicknesses varying from 1. 1 to 0. 3 nm, The method is applied to check the reliability of the spectrometer transmission functions reported previously by Weng et al, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, animal cell culturing has been {{essential}} for biomedical research and biotechnological activities in general. Along with this increasing importance, biosafety concerns have pointed to the risks of manipulating animal cell cultures for {{human health and the}} environment. A maximal reduction of these risks necessitates a thorough risk assessment of the cell cultures used. It involves an evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture, including subsequent properties acquired as a result of genetic modification, and the possibility that the cell culture may inadvertently or deliberately become contaminated with pathogens. The latter is a major hazard associated with the manipulation of animal cell cultures, as adventitious agents may be pathogenic and have a better capacity to survive in unfavorable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination.</b> Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the risks encountered during the handling of cell cultures should include considerations regarding the type of manipulation as well. As a rule, cell cultures known to harbor an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent. With the exception of very well-characterized cell cultures for which the use of a type II biosafety cabinet depends on the origin of the cells, work with cell cultures from human or primate origin should generally and minimally be performed under containment level 2 using a type II biosafety cabinet. In every case, containment measures should minimize <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination</b> of the cell cultures and offer a maximal protection of human health and the environment...|$|E

Nerve lesions induced by REV were char-acterized by abundant plasma cells, but they could not always be differen-tiated from lesions of MD. However, the absence of contact spread and the high susceptibility of line 6 chickens were some obvious characteristics distinguishing the REV-induced syndrome from that of MD.

40|$|A {{coniferous}} woodland in {{the vicinity}} of the British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, was used to examine the spatial, temporal and depth distribution of 134 Cs, 137 Cs, 238 Pu, 239 + 240 Pu and 241 Amin soil and leaf litter. All the radionuclides, with the exception of 134 Cs, showed a consistent fall in accumulated soil and litter deposits with increasing distance from the woodland edge nearest to Sellafield. 137 Cs levels in soil declined from 53 to 28 kBq m- 2, 239 + 240 Pu from 5. 5 to 3. 6 kBqm- 2 and 241 Am from 2. 9 to 1. 1 kBq m- 2 within 100 m of the forest edge. This decline is attributed to greater deposition occurring at the leading edge of the woodland. The uniform deposition pattern of 134 Cs in soil is consistent with the hypothesis that, at the time of sampling, these deposits derived largely from wet deposition during passage of the Chernobyl plume over Cumbria in May 1986. Results for the leaf litter indicate a similar spatial distribution to that observed in soil. Radionuclide concentrations were also similar but this is not attributable to <b>adventitious</b> soil <b>contamination</b> because significant differences between isotopic ratios of 134 Cs: 137 Cs and 238 Pu: 239 + 240 Pu imply that the contamination on leaf litter is of more recent origin than that in soils...|$|R

40|$|Vaccines {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} public health medicinal products with an excellent safety record. As vaccines are produced using biological materials, there is a need to safeguard against potential <b>contamination</b> with <b>adventitious</b> agents. Adventitious agents could be inadvertently introduced into a vaccine through starting materials used for production. Therefore, extensive testing has been recommended at specific stages of vaccine manufacture to demonstrate the absence of adventitious agents. Additionally, the incorporation of viral clearance steps in the manufacturing process can aid in reducing the risk of <b>adventitious</b> agent <b>contamination.</b> However, for live viral vaccines, aside from possible purification of the virus or vector, extensive adventitious agent clearance may not be feasible. In the event that an adventitious agent is detected in a vaccine, it is important to determine its origin, evaluate its potential for human infection and pathology, and discern which batches of vaccine may have been affected in order to take risk mitigation action. To achieve this, it is necessary to have archived samples of the vaccine and ancillary components, ideally from developmental through to current batches, as well as samples of the biological materials used in the manufacture of the vaccine, since these are the most likely sources of an adventitious agent. The need for formal guidance on such vaccine sample archiving has been recognized but not fulfilled. We summarize in this paper several prior major cases of vaccine <b>contamination</b> with <b>adventitious</b> agents and provide points for consideration on sample archiving of live recombinant viral vector vaccines for use in humans.

Deposition techniques such as electrodeposition, spin coating, spraying or printing are promising techniques to increase the throughput and reduce the cost per Watt of Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenide (CIGS), Copper-Zinc-Tin-Sulphide (CZTS) and perovskite thin film solar technologies. All these technologies require pre-treatment of the substrate prior to the deposition of the thin film and ideally this pretreatment should also be performed at atmospheric pressure. Results {{presented in this paper}} show that use of an atmospheric-pressure plasma is highly effective in activating the surface of substrates commonly used in thin film photovoltaic (PV) device fabrication. Surface activation improves the adhesion of thin films. The use of an atmospheric activation process is compatible with a continuous vacuumfree PV fabrication process. Soda lime glass (SDL) and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass are substrates commonly used in the fabrication of photovoltaic modules. These substrates have been surface treated using a He/O 2 atmospheric-pressure plasma, resulting in increased surface energy as evidenced by Water Contact Angle (WCA) measurements. The pre-treatment reduces <b>adventitious</b> surface <b>contamination</b> on the substrates as shown using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The advantages of using the atmospheric plasma surface pre-treatment has been demonstrated by using it prior to atmospheric deposition of Cadmium Sulphide (CdS) thin films using a sonochemical process.

The zwitterionic {{nature of the}} amino acids in the solid state is unequivocally evident from the N 1 s signals of the protonated amine groups and the C 1 s signature of carboxylate groups. Significant <b>adventitious</b> carbon <b>contamination</b> is evident for all samples but can be quantitatively accounted for. No intrinsic differences in the XP spectra are evident between two polymorphs (α and γ) of glycine, indicating that the crystallographic differences have a minor influence on the core level BEs for this system. The two nitrogen centers in the imidazole group of histidine exhibit an N 1 s BE shift that {{is in line with}} previously reported data for theophylline and aqueous imidazole solutions, while the nitrogen and carbon chemical shifts reflect the unusual guanidinium chemical environment in arginine. It is shown that the complex envelopes of C 1 s and O 1 s photoemission spectra for short-chain peptides can be analyzed quantitatively by reference to the less complex XP spectra of the constituent amino acids, provided the peptides are of high enough purity. The distinctive N 1 s photoemission from the amide linkages provides an indicator of peptide formation even in the presence of common impurities, and variations in the relative intensities of N 1 s were found to be diagnostic {{for each of the three}} peptides investigated (RGD, RGDS, and RGDSC) ...|$|R

Subsequent irradiation at 350 nm of the receptor-modified surface yielded the open → closed conversion of the grafted anthracene-appended receptor, as clearly supported by IR spectroscopy data. Grafting of the open receptor and its subsequent closing did not change significantly the surface topography, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed formation of perfectly dense and homogeneous molecular films without <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination</b> or aggregated islands. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements in feedback mode using an appropriate redox mediator (i. e., 9, 10 -diethoxyanthracene DEA) provided clear evidence for an efficient charge transport process between grafted receptors. However, the kinetics of the mediator regeneration was faster when the receptors were under their closed form. Interestingly, light-activated switching of the anthracene-appended receptor offered the unique opportunity to pattern the surface using UV photolithography through an optical mask.

We examined {{the influence of the}} <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination</b> of the ITO surface by airborne molecular contaminants on the electrical transport across an ITO-based van der Waals interface. We constructed large-area junctions of the form ITO//Ga 2 O 3 /EGaIn, where EGaIn is a liquid eutectic gallium-indium alloy covered with a self-passivating thin oxide film (Ga 2 O 3 of ∼ 0. 7 nm), and “// ” denotes the van der Waals interface formed between the ITO and EGaIn electrodes. Comparisons of the current density data for junctions formed with ITO surfaces prepared via five different surface cleaning methods—utilizing UV light, ozone and/or organic solvent (ethanol) —indicated that the electrical conductance of the ITO//Ga 2 O 3 van der Waals interface was significantly enhanced (by three orders of magnitude) by UV/ozone surface cleaning, based on comparisons of the median value of the log-current density, and the dispersion of the data was significantly narrowed.

Herein, we demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to produce pristine self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold surfaces that are devoid of adventitious species. The chemical purity or the pristine quality of the SAM was verified by the experimental relative atomic ratios measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of all elements including carbon and corresponded to within 5 % of the stoichiometric ratios. Perfluoro-octyl-thiolate (F 8) was used as a model compound in this study, where monolayers were assembled from solutions of an acetylated F 8 precursor. Quantitative elemental characterization of the acetylated F 8 precursor by cold-stage XPS provided valuable reference data for the analysis of the subsequent SAMs. Comprehensive analysis of high-resolution XPS C 1 s spectra proved to be essential for establishing the purity of the SAMs, since the peaks of the adventitious species were easily distinguished from those of the F 8. Analyses of deliberately contaminated F 8 SAMs showed that the adventitious species persisted during the process of self-assembly and therefore co-existed with the SAM in the interfacial region. The work also established that even a lengthy deposition time of 18 h was incapable of displacing the adventitious species present at the interface...|$|E

40|$|The Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) {{was planned}} and {{constructed}} in the 1960 s to support the Apollo program {{in the context of}} landing on the Moon and safely returning humans. The enduring science return from that effort is a result of careful curation of planetary materials. Technical decisions for the first facility included sample handling environment (vacuum vs inert gas), and instruments for making basic sample assessment, but the most difficult decision, and most visible, was stringent biosafety vs ultra-clean sample handling. Biosafety required handling of samples in negative pressure gloveboxes and rooms for containment and use of sterilizing protocols and animal/plant models for hazard assessment. Ultra-clean sample handling worked best in positive pressure nitrogen environment gloveboxes in positive pressure rooms, using cleanable tools of tightly controlled composition. The requirements for these two objectives were so different, that the solution was to design and build a new facility for specific purpose of preserving the scientific integrity of the samples. The resulting Lunar Curatorial Facility was designed and constructed, from 1972 - 1979, with advice and oversight by a very active committee comprised of lunar sample scientists. The high precision analyses required for planetary science are enabled by stringent contamination control of trace elements in the materials and protocols of construction (e. g., trace element screening for paint and flooring materials) and the equipment used in sample handling and storage. As other astromaterials, especially small particles and atoms, were added to the collections curated, the technical tension between particulate cleanliness and organic cleanliness was addressed in more detail. Techniques for minimizing particulate contamination in sample handling environments use high efficiency air filtering techniques typically requiring organic sealants which offgas. Protocols for reducing adventitious carbon on sample handling surfaces often generate particles. Further work is needed to achieve both minimal particulate and <b>adventitious</b> carbon <b>contamination.</b> This paper will discuss these facility topics and others in the historical context of nearly 50 years' curation experience for lunar rocks and regolith, meteorites, cosmic dust, comet particles, solar wind atoms, and asteroid particles at Johnson Space Center...|$|R
40|$|Near-edge X-ray {{absorption}} {{fine structure}} (NEXAFS) spectroscopy {{is a powerful}} technique for characterizing the composition and bonding state of nanoscale materials and the top few nanometers of bulk and thin film specimens. When coupled with imaging methods like photoemission electron microscopy, it enables chemical imaging of materials with nanometer-scale lateral spatial resolution. However, analysis of NEXAFS spectra is often performed under the assumption of structural and compositional homogeneity within the nanometer-scale depth probed by this technique. This assumption can introduce large errors when analyzing {{the vast majority of}} solid surfaces due to the presence of complex surface and near-surface structures such as oxides and contamination layers. An analytical methodology is presented for removing the contribution of these nanoscale overlayers from NEXAFS spectra of two-layered systems to provide a corrected photoabsorption spectrum of the substrate. This method relies on the subtraction of the NEXAFS spectrum of the overlayer adsorbed on a reference surface from the spectrum of the two-layer system under investigation, where the thickness of the overlayer is independently determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This approach is applied to NEXAFS data acquired {{for one of the most}} challenging cases: air-exposed hard carbon-based materials with adventitious carbon contamination from ambient exposure. The contribution of the adventitious carbon was removed from the as-acquired spectra of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) to determine the intrinsic photoabsorption NEXAFS spectra of these materials. The method alters the calculated fraction of sp 2 -hybridized carbon from 5 to 20 % and reveals that the <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination</b> can be described as a layer containing carbon and oxygen ([O]/[C] = 0. 11 ± 0. 02) with a thickness of 0. 6 ± 0. 2 nm and a fraction of sp 2 -bonded carbon of 0. 19 ± 0. 03.

40|$|The loosely-packed {{structure}} of low-density self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) enables the constituent molecules of these surfaces to undergo reversible conformational transitions {{in response to}} electrical stimulation, leading to controllable changes in macroscopic surface properties such as wettability. This dissertation reports key new findings on the structure and function of these dynamically switchable surfaces. Low-density SAMs can switch their electrochemical impedance properties in response to applied electrical potential. This function is tunable, such that {{the magnitude of the}} impedance response can be selected by the user, and reversible, such that the material can be returned to its initial state after switching. These switchable impedance characteristics are exhibited by low-density SAMs of both 16 -carbon and 11 -carbon chain length, assembled on both gold and silver. Low-density SAMs show robust stability in long-term storage conditions including air, argon at room temperature, argon at 4 °C, and ethanol. Analyses by infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the insensitivity of low-density SAMs to degradative phase-segregation, <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination,</b> and oxidation. Thiolates within a SAM can migrate laterally from high-density regions into low-density regions. This phenomenon is a function of temperature, with higher temperatures promoting greater lateral mobility, and a function of SAM chain length, with shorter SAMs exhibiting mobility at lower thermal thresholds {{as a result of their}} weaker inter-chain interactions. Low-density SAMs also have interstitial spaces between their thiolates which can accept the intercalation of linear hydrophobic and amphiphilic analyte molecules. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and surface plasmon resonance analysis reveal the intercalation of stearic acid, palmitic acid, and octadecyl rhodamine into low-density SAMs, with more polar solvents encouraging greater levels of intercalation. This dissertation thus expands our understanding of the unique characteristics of switchable low-density SAMs, providing a foundation for further study, optimization, and innovation. Such developments may ultimately lead to next-generation technologies such as diagnostic sensors for non-invasive detection of disease markers and dynamic substrates for cell growth and tissue development...|$|E
40|$|Both {{labelling}} and traceability {{of genetically}} modified organisms are current issues that are considered in trade and regulation. Currently, labelling {{of genetically modified}} foods containing detectable transgenic material is required by EU legislation. A proposed package of legislation would extend this labelling to foods without any traces of transgenics. These new legislations would also impose labelling and a traceability system based on documentation throughout the food and feed manufacture system. The regulatory issues of risk analysis and labelling are currently harmonised by Codex Alimentarius. The implementation and maintenance of the regulations necessitates sampling protocols and analytical methodologies that allow for accurate {{determination of the content}} of genetically modified organisms within a food and feed sample. Current methodologies for the analysis of genetically modified organisms are focused on either one of two targets, the transgenic DNA inserted- or the novel protein(s) expressed- in a genetically modified product. For most DNA-based detection methods, the polymerase chain reaction is employed. Items that need consideration in the use of DNA-based detection methods include the specificity, sensitivity, matrix effects, internal reference DNA, availability of external reference materials, hemizygosity versus homozygosity, extrachromosomal DNA, and international harmonisation. For most protein-based methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with antibodies binding the novel protein are employed. Consideration should be given to the selection of the antigen bound by the antibody, accuracy, validation, and matrix effects. Currently, validation of detection methods for analysis of genetically modified organisms is taking place. In addition, new methodologies are developed, including the use of microarrays, mass spectrometry, and surface plasmon resonance. Challenges for GMO detection include the detection of transgenic material in materials with varying chromosome numbers. The existing and proposed regulatory EU requirements for traceability of genetically modified products fit within a broader tendency towards traceability of foods in general and, commercially, towards products that can be distinguished from each other. Traceability systems document the history of a product and may serve the purpose of both marketing and health protection. In this framework, segregation and identity preservation systems allow for the separation of genetically modified and non-modified products from "farm to fork". Implementation of these systems comes with specific technical requirements for each particular step of the food processing chain. In addition, the feasibility of traceability systems depends on a number of factors, including unique identifiers for each genetically modified product, detection methods, permissible levels of contamination, and financial costs. In conclusion, progress has been achieved in the field of sampling, detection, and traceability of genetically modified products, while some issues remain to be solved. For success, much will depend on the threshold level for <b>adventitious</b> <b>contamination</b> set by legislation...|$|E
