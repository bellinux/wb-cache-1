25|$|Protective films can {{be applied}} to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to {{increase}} corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper’s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium’s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner <b>aluminium</b> <b>brass</b> or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.|$|E
25|$|Copper alloy tubes can be {{supplied}} either {{with a bright}} metallic surface (CuNiO) or with a thin, firmly attached oxide layer (<b>aluminium</b> <b>brass).</b> These finish types allow {{for the formation of}} a protective layer. The protective oxide surface is best achieved when the system is operated for several weeks with clean, oxygen containing cooling water. While the protective layer forms, supportive measures can be carried out to enhance the process, such as the addition of iron sulfate or intermittent tube cleaning. The protective film that forms on Cu-Ni alloys in aerated seawater becomes mature in about three months at 60nbsp&°F and becomes increasingly protective with time. The film is resistant to polluted waters, irregular velocities, and other harsh conditions. Further details are available.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{determination}} of mass attenuation coefficients for mono-energetic x-ray and Gamma rays {{has been reported}} by various investigators. In this study, an attempt is made to evaluate the mass attenuation coefficients (µ/ρ) and total photon interaction cross section (σtot) values of few samples in a heterogeneous x-ray beam from a medical diagnostic x-ray unit, operated at a peak voltage of 85 KVp. Sheets of <b>aluminium,</b> copper, <b>brass</b> and tissue equivalent plastic (virtual water) have been employed. By comparing the experimental values of mass attenuation coefficients (µ/ρ) with those values published in the literature, the prominent energy of interacting photons {{are estimated to be}} 36. 8 KeV, 48. 7 KeV, 47. 8 KeV and 35. 5 KeV for <b>aluminium,</b> copper, <b>brass</b> and virtual water respectively. From these experimental µ/ρ values, the total photon interaction cross section values (σtot) are calculated in the units of barn/atom. These experimental σtot values are in good agreement with the theoretical values deduced in the literature with percentage deviation of only + 0. 03 % and + 0. 09 % for aluminium and copper (elements) respectively at the prominent energy of interaction. The percentage deviation is- 1. 12 % for Brass (alloy) and + 5. 77 % for virtual water (mixture). The results are discussed...|$|R

In this test there is a variable that being manipulate which are the element definition and type of material like <b>aluminium,</b> magnesium and <b>brass.</b> Meanwhile the variable that constant is the size dimension. After the drawing drawn in ALGOR software fill in the information needed to run the simulation and the data needed is collected.
