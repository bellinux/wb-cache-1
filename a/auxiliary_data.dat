5|$|Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, {{audio and}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data</b> using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels {{of an active}} video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data</b> are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data</b> using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data.</b> Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{implements}} the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, {{transport of}} compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data,</b> and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically {{compatible with the}} CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} visual {{categorization}} problem and present {{a method that}} utilizes weakly labeled data from other visual domains as the <b>auxiliary</b> source <b>data</b> for enhancing the original learning system. The proposed method aims to expand the intra-class diversity of original training data through the collaboration with the source data. In order to bring the original target domain <b>data</b> and the <b>auxiliary</b> source domain <b>data</b> into the same feature space, we introduce a weakly-supervised cross-domain dictionary learning method, which learns a reconstructive, discriminative and domain-adaptive dictionary pair and the corresponding classifier parameters without using any prior information. Such a method operates at a high level, {{and it can be}} applied to different cross-domain applications. To build up the <b>auxiliary</b> domain <b>data,</b> we manually collect images from Web pages, and select human actions of specific categories from a different dataset. The proposed method is evaluated for human action recognition, image classification and event recognition tasks on the UCF YouTube dataset, the Caltech 101 / 256 datasets and the Kodak dataset, respectively, achieving outstanding results...|$|R
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} constructs a clustering in time {{proportional to}} {{the square of the}} number of points to be clustered. This is also {{proportional to the}} size of its input, when the input is provided {{in the form of an}} explicit distance matrix. The algorithm uses an amount of memory proportional to the number of points, when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data</b> structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other <b>auxiliary</b> <b>data</b> during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{abortions in}} {{hospital}} sterilising staff were analysed {{using data from}} a postal questionnaire and a hospital discharge register. The study included all the sterilising staff employed in Finnish hospitals in 1980; the controls were nursing <b>auxiliaries.</b> <b>Data</b> from the questionnaire showed that the frequency of spontaneous abortions was 11. 3 % for the sterilising staff and 10. 6 % for the nursing auxiliaries. When the staff were concerned in sterilising procedures during their pregnancy the frequency was 16. 7 % compared with 5. 6 % for the non-exposed pregnancies. Adjustment for age, parity, decade of pregnancy, smoking habits, and intake of coffee and alcohol {{did not affect the}} differences. The increased frequency of spontaneous abortion correlated with exposure to ethylene oxide but not with exposure to glutaraldehyde or to formaldehyde. Analysis of spontaneous abortions from the hospital discharge register confirmed the findings. Thus the results from the two independent analyses suggest that exposure to ethylene oxide in hospitals may carry a risk of spontaneous abortion among sterilising staff...|$|R

40|$|During a {{clinical}} trial, early endpoints {{may be available}} on some patients for whom the primary endpoint has not been observed. To model this situation, we develop a parametric model and a nonparametric model that utilize <b>auxiliary</b> endpoint <b>data</b> to predict the missing primary endpoint data. These predicted primary endpoint data assist researchers in determining whether the conclusions of {{a clinical}} trial can be obtained and announced earlier than otherwise. And such modeling {{may be able to}} enhance the precision of comparisons of the primary endpoint across treatment arms. The parametric model is developed using a Bayesian paradigm assuming that the data are normally distributed. The nonparametric model is developed using kernel density estimation. In both cases we base the conditional predictive distribution of the missing primary endpoint <b>data</b> on the <b>auxiliary</b> endpoint <b>data</b> for patients with missing data and on the pairs of observations for patients who have achieved both endpoints. The effects of bandwidth on the performance of the nonparametric model are evaluated. We consider a two-treatment clinical trial in which the primary objective is to compare the two treatments {{on the basis of the}} primary endpoint. We compare the performances of our two proposed models with those of two conventional methods, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Ignoring Missing Values (IMV). Our simulation results demonstrate that both the parametric and the nonparametric model have advantages over conventional methods. The parametric model performs slightly better than the nonparametric model when the distributions of the <b>auxiliary</b> endpoint <b>data</b> and primary endpoint data are jointly normal. The nonparametric model is better than the parametric model when these distributions deviate sufficiently from normality. So the nonparametric model is robust in this sense...|$|R
