40|$|This study {{investigated}} S-cone discrimination using a test annulus {{surrounded by an}} inner and outer <b>adapting</b> field with systematic manipulation of the <b>adapting</b> l L∕LM or s S∕LM chromaticities. The results showed that different <b>adapting</b> l chromaticities altered S-cone discrimination for a high <b>adapting</b> s chromaticity due to parvocellular input to the koniocellular pathway. In addition, S-cone discrimination {{was determined by the}} combined spectral signals arising from both <b>adapting</b> fields. The “white ” <b>adapting</b> field or an <b>adapting</b> field with a different l chromaticity from the other fields wasmore likely to have a stronger influence on discrimination thresh-olds. These results indicated that the two cardinal axes are not independent in S-cone discrimination, and the two <b>adapting</b> fields jointly contribute to S-cone discrimination through a cortical summation mechanism. © 201...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBy {{means of}} {{asymmetric}} color matching, {{the effects of}} steady-state chromatic adaptation on the color appearance of briefly presented chromatic flashes were investigated. The <b>adapting</b> and test lights were of equal luminance (35 cd/m 2) and differed from the standard grey <b>adapting</b> light either along the L− 2 M (red and green), or along the S−(L + M) (yellow and violet) line. The red (green) <b>adapting</b> light results in 6 % positive (negative) L cone contrast and 11 % negative (positive) M cone contrast {{with respect to the}} grey <b>adapting</b> light. The violet (yellowish) <b>adapting</b> light yields a positive (negative) S cone contrast of 50 % relative to the standard <b>adapting</b> light. The main findings are: (i) iso-luminant <b>adapting</b> lights that differ only in their L− 2 M signal (red and green) resulted in asymmetric matches that differ mainly in the L− 2 M coordinate; (ii) iso-luminant <b>adapting</b> lights that differ in their S cone excitation only (yellow and violet) result in asymmetric matches that differ mainly in their S cone coordinate; (iii) the largest difference between test and match coordinates is found in the S cone signal for violet adaptation; (iv) the luminance differences of the asymmetric matches are within 1 % of the mean luminance and are mostly non-systematic; (v) adaptation to iso-luminant red and green lights yields adaptational changes mainly in the L cones and not in the M cones; (vi) substantial quantitative deviations from a von Kries law are observed for L cone signals for red and green adaptation and for S cone decrements under yellow adaptation; (vii) S cone-isolating <b>adapting</b> lights result in small additive shifts in the S cone matches; <b>adapting</b> lights differing only in the L and M cone signal from the standard grey <b>adapting</b> light yield additive shifts only in the L and M cone matches.

40|$|To {{test whether}} a retinal or {{cortical}} mechanism sums contributions from two <b>adapting</b> fields to chromatic dis-crimination, L/M discrimination {{was measured with}} a test annulus surrounded by an inner circular field and an outer rectangular field. A retinal summation mechanism predicted that the discrimination pattern would not change with {{a change in the}} fixation location. Therefore, the fixation was set either in the inner or the outer field in two experiments. When one of the <b>adapting</b> fields was “red ” and the other was “green, ” the <b>adapting</b> field where the observer fixated always had a stronger influence on chromatic discrimination. However, when one <b>adapting</b> field was “white ” and the other was red or green, the white field always weighted more heavily than the other <b>adapting</b> field in determining discrimination thresholds, whether the white field or the fixation was in the inner or outer <b>adapting</b> field. These results suggest that a cortical mechanism determines the relative contribu-tions from different <b>adapting</b> fields. © 2011 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 330. 1690, 330. 4060, 330. 5510, 330. 7320. 1...|$|R
