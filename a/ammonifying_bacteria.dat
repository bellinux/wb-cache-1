Therefore, our objective was to {{study the effects of}} heavy metal pollution on microbial populations (bacteria, actinomyces, fungi, <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> nitrobacteria and cellulolytic bacteria) and microbial activities (microbial biomass C (MBC), basal respiration and metabolic quotient (qCO 2)) on soils of Lawu Cu-Zn-Pb mine in central Tibet, China. Five sampling sites included the mine center (Site 1), grassland near the mine center (Site 2), traffic road of the mine (Site 3), abandoned mine tailing (Site 4) and about 2 km from the mine center (Site 5, taken as the control). A composite soil sample was collected using a soil sampler with 5 cm diameter and 10 cm depth at eight random positions in each sampling site. Results indicated that compared to the control, soils in Sites 1 - 4 were polluted by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd), resulting in decrease in culturable number of bacteria, actinomyces, <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> nitrobacteria and cellulolytic bacteria, and MBC contents, but increase in basal respiration and qCO 2.

The number of <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> oligonitrophilic bacteria, oligotrophic bacteria and nitrogenase activity in Calcisol soil under different agricultural crops in Surhandarya region Uzbekistan were compared. Soil samples were collected from the soil under cotton, melon, tomato, wheat in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. We measured the microbial population after tillage at depth intervals of 0 - 10 cm, 10 - 20 cm, and 20 - 30 cm. The results revealed that the number and enzymatic activity of microorganisms depended upon plant type, depth and date of sampling. The total number of <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and oligotrophic bacteria tended to be highest under tomato and wheat. The number of ammonifying and oligotrophic bacteria were higher at the 20 - 30 cm soil depth of soil than at the 0 - 10 cm depth regardless of plant type.

Fertilizer treatments were N as urea, P as ammophos, and K as potassium chloride. The nitrification inhibitor PO was added to urea and ammophos at the rate of 2 %. Three treatments—N 200 P 140 K 60 (T 1), N 200 P 140 POK 60 (T 2), and N 200 P 140 POK 60 (T 3) mg kg- 1 soil—were applied for this study. The control (C) was without fertilizer and PO. The populations of oligotrophic bacteria, <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> nitrifying bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, mineral assimilating bacteria, oligonitrophilic bacteria, and bacteria group Azotobacter were determined by the most probable number method.

Such ‘innovative’, suitable agricultural management practices can have positive effects on soil microbial communities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the effects of two different agricultural systems (‘innovative’ and ‘conventional’) on the diversity of important groups of microorganisms related to soil fertility, such as fungi, actinomycetes, Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Azotobacter spp., proteolytic and <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The study was carried out in an apricot orchard located in Southern Italy. Since 2003, half of the orchard was managed adopting no-tillage, cover crops, compost application, drip irrigation, winter pruning and limited mineral fertilization, whereas the other half was subjected to ‘conventional’ management. Soil samples were randomly collected from the superficial soil layer in four different orchard positions: innovative along the inter-rows (IIR) and under drip emitters (IUE), and conventional along the inter-rows (CIR) and under drip emitters (CUE). Higher populations of total bacteria, actinomycetes and proteolytic bacteria were induced by IIR treatment, whereas Pseudomonas spp., Azotobacter spp. and <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria</b> showed increased populations in IUE. No differences between the treatments were found for total fungi and Bacillus spp. The higher inputs of organic matter of innovative plots caused an increase in the microbial groups responsible for nitrogen metabolism in well-watered zones (IUE), and higher activities of decomposer and humus-forming microorganisms in IIR.

40|$|Straws {{contain a}} large amount of organic matter and nitrogen, phosphous, {{potassium}} and different microelements. Straw-returning becomes {{one of the most important}} measures to replace the traditional organic fertilizer and increase the soil organic matter. As the bond between next stubble crops and soil microorganism, returned straws play an important role in underground rhizosphere microorganisms environment. In this study, the effects of different straw returning modes on the soil microorganism and enzyme activity were investigated. The experiment included four different treatment: the soil of continuous-cropping with straw mulching (CT 1), the soil of continuous-cropping with straw buried (CT 2), the soil of alternate-cropping with straw mulching (T 1), the soil of alternate-cropping with straw buried (T 2). Corn was planted in the above treatments and determined the soil microorganism and enzyme activity at the different growth stage. The results showed that under the same straw-returning, the microbial biomass carbon content, corn microorganism and soil enzyme activities of T 1 and T 2 were higher than those of CT 1 and CT 2. In the soil of continuous-cropping, compared with the straw-mulching, the straw-buried increased significantly in the numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes, <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, nitrifying bacteria and the activities of soil urease and invertase. While in the soil of alternate-cropping, the returning mode of straw had little impacts on the numbers of fungi, <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria and nitrifying bacteria and activities of urease and catalase.

40|$|Le modèle de l'IAWQ du {{processus}} de boues activées représente les mécanismes endogènes de la biomasse nitrifiante par le décès des micro-organismes (équation d'ordre 1 {{par rapport}} à la biomasse). La constante de décès, ou taux de mortalité bA, est aujourd'hui encore mal connue, et en particulier les facteurs influants sur sa valeur. De récentes études ont montré que la prédation par la microfaune pourrait être un facteur déterminant sur la valeur de bA. Cette étude se propose donc de quantifier l'effet de la prédation sur la valeur de bA. Deux réacteurs maintenus sans alimentation en substrat ont été caractérisés en parallèle: l'un a reçu une dose d'antibiotique spécifique aux eucaryotes (cycloheximide) afin de diminuer la quantité d'organismes de la microfaune, alors que l'autre n'a reçu aucun antibiotique (témoin). Les résultats obtenus montrent que le cycloheximide inhibe la plupart des organismes de la microfaune sauf les amibes; celles-ci semblent plutôt stimulées par cet antibiotique. En ce qui concerne la nitrification, un ralentissement de la production de nitrate dans le réacteur traité à l'antibiotique est observé à partir du sixième jour. Cette diminution de production de nitrate est probablement causée par une réduction de l'azote nitrifiable (qui est mobilisé par les amibes) couplée à une prédation des organismes nitrifiants par les amibes. D'ailleurs, l'augmentation de la prédation par les amibes à partir du jour 6 a diminué l'activité nitrifiante également mesurée par respirométrie (rO 2 Nmax). Cette diminution du taux de respiration indique une augmentation du taux de mortalité (bA) des organismes nitrifiants. En effet, la valeur du taux de mortalité mesurée dans le réacteur témoin est de 0. 08 d- 1 alors que selon la microfaune présente dans le réacteur inhibé au cycloheximide, la valeur de ce taux de mortalité a varié entre 0. 05 d- 1 et 0. 15 d- 1. Designing biological {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{with the aid of}} the model developed by the IAWQ requires the knowledge of biological kinetic parameters. For nitrifying activated sludge, these parameters are related to nitrifying bacteria: maximum autotrophic growth rate µAmax, yield coefficient YA and the autotrophic decay rate bA. Although variables influencing µAmax and YA values are well known, {{this is not the case}} for bA. MARTINAGE and PAUL (2000) have recently shown that the bA value is strongly influenced by the influent quality, leading to the assumption that influent quality has a strong effect on microfauna composition, and consequently on the grazing rate of microfauna on nitrifying bacteria. In fixed-film processes, protozoan grazing reduces the bacterial population considerably (NATUSCKA and WELANDER, 1994). However, although many data are available concerning the grazing rates of different protozoa, the effect of microfaunal grazing on nitrification is still a matter of debate (RATSAK et al., 1994) and its effect on the bA value is still unknown. These two topics are investigated here. Nitrifying activated sludges were grown in two identical batch reactors, but in one, cycloheximide was added to inhibit eucaryotic growth (MAURINES CARBONEILL et al., 1998). Microfauna organism numbers were quantified in both reactors by microscopic observations of flagellated protozoa (> 8 µm), amoebae, ciliates, rotifers and higher invertebrates (Fig. 3). Microbial counts were then correlated with the bA value. The latter was determined using the procedure proposed by SALZER (1992) which consists of characterising the time behaviour of the maximum nitrification rate measured by respirometry of activated sludge under substrate starvation. Under these conditions bacteria die and organic nitrogen is released into the bulk phase. This nitrogen is <b>ammonified,</b> and nitrifying <b>bacteria</b> use this substrate to produce nitrate, and then autotrophic bacterial growth occurs. This method takes this growth into account by characterising nitrate production during the experiment (Fig. 2). The effect of cycloheximide on nitrification was first determined to make sure that this compound is not inhibitory toward nitrifiers. Results obtained (Table 1) show that cycloheximide was not inhibitory toward nitrate production or the maximum nitrification oxygen uptake rate (rO 2 N) after 4 hours of contact with nitrifying biomass. Cycloheximide addition in the activated sludge had an important impact on rotifers and flagellates but no effect on ciliates; it also seemed to stimulate amoebae growth. In both reactors, flagellates were mainly Peranama, attached ciliates were mainly Opercularia and Epistylis and a few Vorticella. Free ciliates like Aspidisca and Euplotes were found in both reactors. Variation with time of the abundance of microfauna organisms is shown in Figures 4 and 5 for both reactors. In the reference reactor the number of microfauna organisms decreased with time (Fig. 4) probably due to substrate starvation. Microfauna composition remained however diversified. For the inhibited reactor (Fig. 5), three periods were observed. During period I, the microfauna was mainly composed of ciliates and the number of microfaunal organisms decreased rapidly. During period II, an important growth of amoebae was observed. Cycloheximide was then added during this period to reduce their number. This growth of amoebae seems to be caused by the resistance of these micro-organisms toward inhibiting compounds (SRIKANTH et BERK, 1993). During period III, the number of microfaunal organisms was lower than during period II, and microfauna was mainly composed of ciliates. Nitrate concentration behaviour, necessary for bA calculation, is shown on Figure 6. In the reference reactor, nitrate concentrations varied linearly. For the inhibited reactor, the linear pattern was not observed during period II. This result was probably caused by an important nitrogen assimilation need of amoebae (ELDRIGE and JACKSON, 1993). Because organic nitrogen released by bacterial decay is consumed by amoebae assimilation, less nitrogen is available for the ammonification process and therefore for nitrification. Ammonia concentrations remained below 0. 2 mg N·l- 1 during all the experiment for both reactors. When amoebae disappeared from the inhibited reactor (period III) nitrate concentration varied linearly again. Variations of the maximum nitrification oxygen uptake rate (rO 2 Nmax) with time are presented in Figure 7 (A&B) for both reactors. Two curves are plotted on each figure. Empty squares represent the measured rO 2 N and black points represent the maximum nitrification rate that would have been measured if no growth on ammonification products had occurred. For the reference reactor (Fig. 7 A), a value for bA of 0. 08 d- 1 can be calculated and can be considered constant for a constant microfauna composition. Three bA values can be estimated for the reactor inhibited with cycloheximide (Fig. 7 B), corresponding to the three periods observed for microfauna composition. During period I, the bA value is 0. 05 d- 1  : a decrease in the microfaunal organism numbers implies a decrease of the bA value. During period II, when a development of amoebae is observed, the bA value increases and reaches 0. 15 d- 1. During period III with reduced grazing, the bA value is 0. 13 d- 1. Since during periods I and III the microfauna is mainly composed of ciliates, this difference between bA values is likely due to the observed difference in floc size between periods I and III. The results obtained during this study tend to prove (1) that the use of cycloheximide reduces microfaunal populations but can lead to a development of amoebae, and (2) that microfauna grazing seems to have an influence on the bA value, which can vary from 0. 05 to 0. 15 d- 1 depending on microfaunal composition and abundance...|$|R

Although nitrification and deqitrification in the bulk soil decreased throughout the entire growth cycle, positive adaptation to Cd stress was observed during the ripening stage. Moreover, during the ripening stage, denitrification in the bulk soil under high Cd treatment (20 mg kg-') was even higher than that in the control, indicating a probable change in the ecology of the denitrifying microbes in the Cd-stressed system.

Five agriculturally exploited types of soils (FAO): Haplic Luvisol, Brunic Arenosol, Mollic Gleysol, Eutric Fluvisol, and Rendzina Leptosol were studied. The controls were non-agricultural soils of the same type located in close proximity to agricultural sites. The tested soils varied in terms of pH (4.18 – 7.08), total carbon (8.39 – 34.90  g kg− 1), easily degradable carbon content (0.46 – 1.11  g kg− 1), moisture (5.20 – 13.50  %), and nitrogen forms (mg kg− 1): 1.68 – 27.17, 0.036 – 0.862, 0.012 – 3.389 for nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen, respectively. The AB abundance in agricultural soils ranged from 1.1 to 6.4  ×  104  cfu g− 1, while in the controls it was significantly higher—from 2.0 to 110  ×  104 cfu g− 1 of soil. Also, AA in the controls was three-times higher than in the agricultural soils. Strong associations between AA and the abundance of AB in the control (r =  0.954 ***) and agricultural soils (r =  0.833 ***) were proved.

40|$|The eastern Tibetan Plateau {{has become}} {{increasingly}} warmer and drier since the 1990 s. Such warming and drying has {{a great impact on}} ecosystem processes on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. To determine their combined effects on CO 2 and N 2 O emission rates, we conducted a field manipulative experiment in an alpine meadow of the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the growing season of 2009. The experiment showed that warming manipulation increased soil temperature by 1 A degrees C, and drying manipulation decreased soil water content by 6. 8 %. We found that by counteracting the effect of low temperature in the area, experimental warming significantly increased soil microbial biomass, the number of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria,</b> nitrobacteria and denitrifying bacteria, and facilitated the emission rates of CO 2 and N 2 O by 33. 4 and 31. 5 %, respectively. However, decreased precipitation further aggravated soil water stress and inhibited the numbers of these organisms, and reduced the emission rates of CO 2 and N 2 O by 47. 4 and 37. 9 %, respectively. So decreased soil water content tended to offset the positive effect of warming. Compared to the positive effects of warming, decreased soil water content was shown in our study to have even greater impact on the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the growing season. Therefore, inhibition of CO 2 and N 2 O emission rates (32. 3 and 29. 3 %, respectively) by warming and drying will intensify if the combined effects of these climatic trends persist in the region.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} to assess the {{influence}} of interaction of combination of immobilized nitrogen cycling bacteria (INCB) with aquatic macrophytes on nitrogen removal from the eutrophic waterbody, and to get insight into different mechanisms involved in nitrogen removal. Methods: The aquatic macrophytes used include Eichhornia crassipes (summer-autumn floating macrophyte), Elodea nuttallii (winter-growing submerged macrophyte), and nitrogen cycling bacteria including ammonifying, nitrosating, nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria isolated from Taihu Lake. The immobilization carriers materials were made from hydrophilic monomers 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) and hydrophobic 2 -hydroxyethyl methylacrylate (HEMA). Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the roles of macrophytes combined with INCB on nitrogen removal from eutrophic water during different seasons. Results: Eichhornia crassipes and Elodea nuttallii had different potentials in purification of eutrophic water. Floating macrophyte+bacteria (INCB) performed best in improving water quality (during the first experiment) and decreased total nitrogen (TN) by 70. 2 %, nitrite and ammonium by 92. 2 % and 50. 9 %, respectively, during the experimental period, when water transparency increased from 0. 5 m to 1. 8 m. When INCB was inoculated into the floating macrophyte system, the populations of nitrosating, nitrifying, and denitrifying bacteria increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to the un-inoculated treatments, but <b>ammonifying</b> <b>bacteria</b> showed no obvious difference between different treatments. Lower values of chlorophyll a, CODMn, and pH were found in the microbial-plant integrated system, as compared to the control. Highest reduction in N was noted during the treatment with submerged macrophyte+INCB, being 26. 1 % for TN, 85. 2 % for nitrite, and 85. 2 % for ammonium at the end of 2 nd experiment. And in the treatment, the populations of ammonifying, nitrosating, nitrifying, and denitrifying bacteria increased by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude, as compared to the un-inoculated treatments. Similar to the first experiment, higher water transparency and lower values of chlorophyll a, CODMn and pH were observed in the plant+INCB integrated system, as compared to other treatments. These results indicated that plant-microbe interaction showed beneficial effects on N removal from the eutrophic waterbody...|$|E
