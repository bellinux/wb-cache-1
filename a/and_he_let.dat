25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game {{went down in}} {{football}} history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently in the back <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E
25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E

500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable.

2500|$|Dionysius of Alexandria {{stood against}} premillennialism when the chiliastic work, The Refutation of the Allegorizers written by Nepos, a bishop in Egypt became popular in Alexandria. Dionysius argued against Nepos's {{influence}} and convinced the churches {{of the region}} of amillennialism. The church historian, Eusebius, reports this in his Ecclesiastical History. Eusebius also had low regard for the chiliast, Papias, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> {{it be known that}} in his opinion Papias was [...] "a man of small mental capacity" [...] because he had taken the Apocalypse literally.|$|E

2500|$|After his loss, King {{stayed on}} as Opposition Leader, {{where it was}} his policy to refrain from {{offering}} advice or alternative policies. Indeed, his policy preferences were {{not much different from}} Bennett's, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> the Conservative government have its way. Though he gave the impression of sympathy with progressive and liberal causes, he had no enthusiasm for the New Deal of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt (which Bennett eventually tried to emulate, after floundering without solutions for several years), and he never advocated massive government action to alleviate depression in Canada. Upon his return to office in October 1935, however, King seemed to demonstrate a commitment (like Franklin Roosevelt) to the underprivileged, speaking of a new era where [...] "poverty and adversity, want and misery are the enemies which Liberalism will seek to banish from the land".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1992–93 season, 22 clean sheets from Schmeichel helped United win the Premier League championship, {{the first}} time the club had won England's top trophy in 26 years. Schmeichel was once again named [...] "The World's Best Goalkeeper" [...] in 1993. In January 1994, Schmeichel fell out with Ferguson, as United had squandered a 3–0 lead to draw 3–3 with Liverpool. The two had a row where Schmeichel [...] "said the most horrible things", and he was {{subsequently}} sacked by Ferguson. A few days later, Schmeichel made an improvised apology to the other players. Unknown to him, Ferguson was eavesdropping on this, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> Schmeichel stay at Manchester United. Schmeichel and United repeated the Premier League championship win {{at the end of the}} season, also capturing the FA Cup. At international level, however, he suffered disappointment as Denmark failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

[...] Li Shimin was forced to withdraw back to Chang'an, and Liu and Yin were removed from their posts.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1930, Crater and his wife Stella Mance Wheeler were vacationing at their summer cabin in Belgrade, Maine. In late July, Crater {{received}} a telephone call. He offered no information to his wife {{about the content of}} the call, other than to say that he had to return to the city [...] "to straighten those fellows out". The next day, he arrived at his 40 Fifth Avenue apartment, but instead of dealing with business, he made a trip to Atlantic City, New Jersey, with his mistress, showgirl Sally Lou Ritzi (who used the stage name Ritz). He returned to Maine on August 1, and traveled back to New York on August 3. Before making this final trip, he promised his wife that he would return by her birthday on August 9. Crater's wife stated that he was in good spirits and behaving normally when he departed for New York City. On the morning of Wednesday, August 6, Crater spent two hours going through his files in his courthouse chambers, reportedly destroying several documents. He then had his law clerk Joseph Mara cash two checks for him that amounted to $5,150 (equivalent to about $ in [...] dollars). At noon, he and Mara carried two locked briefcases to his apartment <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> Mara take {{the rest of the day}} off.|$|E
2500|$|This idea of {{separating}} the Creator and youth's {{thought about the}} Creator is harmful. He says, [...] "with the years came understanding, and with understanding knowledge, and with knowledge grief,-and with increased knowledge increased grief. But as he was developed and educated in this way, the simple became more difficult for him, and since with out this guidance he wanted to rule himself, everything {{became more and more}} complicated. – Perhaps he chose the guidance of thought, and in order not to owe anyone anything he let this seed sow itself and let one thought evolve out of another, until eventually the infinite manifested itself to him and made him dizzy. The more he stared fixedly at it, the more his eye lost the visual power to find the way back to finitude.-Perhaps desire blinded him, life seemed like a joke to him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>let</b> God grieve in heaven while he chose pleasure and let enthusiasm speak in vain about conflict and struggle, about courage in dangers, patience in tribulation, love in life, victory in death, reward in heaven, while he let every day have its pleasure.-Perhaps a worldly-minded worry about food and clothing scattered his mind so that he did neither the one nor the other." [...] Kierkegaard's remedy for this individual is {{to find a place to}} be alone with God. He says, [...] "Just as the first book in the Old Testament has been called Genesis, the second Exodus, so it could very well be said that in human life there is a third book called Retreat." [...] He continues, [...] "We are speaking only of the beautiful meaning of the retreat for human life and of how having thought about the Creator in one's youth is the retreat's rescuing angel. Let a person's work take from him what belongs to it, his time, his diligence, but in the advancing years, O God, preserve a recollection of youth that preserves youth's thought of the Creator. Woe to him who separates what God has joined together, who to him who separates adulthood from its youth.|$|E
