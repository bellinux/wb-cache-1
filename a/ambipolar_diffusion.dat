50|$|The {{origin of}} such high {{magnetic}} fields in Ap stars is problematic and two theories {{have been proposed}} in order to explain them. The first is the fossil field hypothesis, in which the field is {{a relic of the}} initial field in the interstellar medium (ISM). There is sufficient magnetic field in the ISM to create such high magnetic fields—indeed, {{so much so that the}} theory of <b>ambipolar</b> <b>diffusion</b> has to be invoked to reduce the field in normal stars. This theory does require the field to remain stable over a long period of time, and it is unclear whether such an obliquely rotating field could do so. Another problem with this theory is to explain why only a small proportion of A-type stars exhibit these high field strengths. The other generation theory is dynamo action within rotating cores of Ap stars; however, the oblique nature of the field cannot be produced, as yet, by this model, as invariably one ends up with a field either aligned with the rotation axis, or at 90° to it. It is also unclear whether it is possible to generate such large dipole fields using this explanation, due to the slow rotation of the star. While this could be explained by invoking a fast rotating core with a high rotation gradient to the surface, it is unlikely that an ordered axisymmetric field would result.|$|E

The rate of the collapse is inversely proportional to the fractional ionisation and two gravitationally-driven <b>ambipolar</b> <b>diffusion</b> regimes for the collapse are observed as predicted in Mouschovias & Morton (1991).

40|$|The planet-forming {{region of}} protoplanetary disks is cold, dense, and {{therefore}} weakly ionized. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence {{is thought to}} be mostly absent, and another mechanism has to be found to explain gas accretion. It has been proposed that magnetized winds, launched from the ionized disk surface, could drive accretion {{in the presence of a}} large-scale magnetic field. The efficiency and the impact of these surface winds on the disk structure is still highly uncertain. We present the first global simulations of a weakly ionized disk that exhibits large-scale magnetized winds. We also study the impact of self-organization, which was previously demonstrated only in non-stratified models. We perform numerical simulations of stratified disks with the PLUTO code. We compute the ionization fraction dynamically, and account for all three non-ideal MHD effects: ohmic and <b>ambipolar</b> <b>diffusions,</b> and the Hall drift. Simplified heating and cooling due to non-thermal radiation is also taken into account in the disk atmosphere. We find that disks can be accreting or not, depending on the configuration of the large-scale magnetic field. Magnetothermal winds, driven both by magnetic acceleration and heating of the atmosphere, are obtained in the accreting case. In some cases, these winds are asymmetric, ejecting predominantly on one side of the disk. The wind mass loss rate depends primarily on the average ratio of magnetic to thermal pressure in the disk midplane. The non-accreting case is characterized by a meridional circulation, with accretion layers at the disk surface and decretion in the midplane. Finally, we observe self-organization, resulting in axisymmetric rings of density and associated pressure "bumps". The underlying mechanism and its impact on observable structures are discussed.

To study the effect of turbulence on the <b>ambipolar</b> <b>diffusion</b> rate, we perturbed the equilibrium filament with a turbulent velocity field quantified by a rms sonic Mach number, M_rms, of 10, 3 or 1. Results: We numerically reproduce the density profiles for filaments that are in magnetohydrostatic and pressure equilibrium with their surroundings obtained by a published paper and show that these equilibria are dynamically stable. If the effect of <b>ambipolar</b> <b>diffusion</b> is considered, these filaments lose magnetic support initiating cloud collapse. The filaments do not lose magnetic flux.

Since {{the temperature of}} prominences is typically {{of the order of}} 10 ^ 4 K, the prominence plasma is only partially ionized. In this paper, we study the effect of neutrals on the wave propagation in a filament thread modeled as a partially ionized homogeneous magnetic flux tube embedded in an homogeneous and fully ionized coronal plasma. Ohmic and <b>ambipolar</b> magnetic <b>diffusion</b> are considered in the basic resistive MHD equations. We numerically compute the eigenfrequencies of kink, slow, and Alfven linear MHD modes, and obtain analytical approximations in some cases. We find that the existence of propagating modes is constrained by the presence of critical values of the longitudinal wavenumber. In particular, the lower and upper frequency cut-offs of kink and Alfven waves owe their existence to magnetic diffusion parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field lines, respectively. The slow mode only has a lower frequency cut-off, which is caused by perpendicular magnetic diffusion and is significantly affected by the ionization degree. In addition, ion-neutral collisions is the most efficient damping mechanism for short wavelengths while ohmic diffusion dominates in the long-wavelength regime.
