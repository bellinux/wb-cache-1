5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He would turn up for training in unwashed kit, and wore the same pair of breeches for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E

5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its short run, it was {{broadcast}} on the Big Three television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while others found it unmemorable <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E
5|$|The album earned Combs five {{nominations}} at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, {{winning the}} Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. On September 7, 2000, {{the album was}} certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 7 million copies. In 1997, Combs was sued for landlord neglect by Inge Bongo. Combs denied the charges. By the late 1990s, he was being criticized for watering down <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> commercializing hip hop, and for using too many guest appearances, samples, and interpolations of past hits in his new songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by then-showrunner Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. The story was a parody of the film industry and its practice with test screenings <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> violent films. It featured several references to various films {{as well as other}} popular culture. Gibson guest starred as himself, and Jack Burns voiced a film studio executive named Edward Christian. Since airing, the episode has received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Gibson was praised for his performance. It was released on the DVD collection The Simpsons Film Festival in 2002, and The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with food shortage {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She made sure the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the legal status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> cordial.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} between Henry and Becket became both increasingly {{personal and}} international in nature. Henry was stubborn and bore grudges, while Becket was vain, ambitious <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> political: neither man {{was willing to}} back down. Both sought the support of Alexander III and other international leaders, arguing their positions in various forums across Europe. The situation worsened in 1164 when Becket fled to France to seek sanctuary with Henry's enemy, Louis VII. Henry harassed Becket's associates in England, and Becket excommunicated religious and secular officials who sided with the king. The pope supported Becket's case in principle but needed Henry's support in dealing with Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, so he repeatedly sought a negotiated solution; the Norman church also intervened to try to assist Henry in finding a solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (<b>and</b> <b>overly</b> provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E

5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time. His ideas are sometimes {{said to be}} superficial; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s, naive in the 1970s, poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s, <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> simple in the 2000s. His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E
5|$|During 1925, Kilner {{was awarded}} a benefit match and had an {{improved}} batting record for the season but critics began to notice a decline in his bowling. He was effective on pitches which favoured spin bowlers, {{but not on the}} flatter pitches prevalent in the dry summer of 1925. Cricket journals, such as The Cricketer, criticised his tendency to bowl leg theory—a tactic regarded as negative <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> defensive—when confronted with batting-friendly conditions. He took 131 wickets at 17.92, finishing second in the Yorkshire averages and helping his team to their fourth successive County Championship. He scored 1,068 runs at an average of 30.51 with two centuries. This gave him the third double of his career. Kilner's popularity with the crowds peaked in 1925, when over three days, 71,000 people attended his benefit match against Middlesex. It raised £4,106 (the equivalent of around £175,000 in 2008), to set a new record for benefit proceeds. There were no Test matches in 1925, but Kilner was once again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, scoring 59 in his only innings and taking five wickets in the match, as well as some end of season matches for the MCC's team from the previous winter.|$|E
5|$|Victory in Normandy {{stemmed from}} several factors. German {{preparations}} along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete {{in some areas}} as resources were diverted elsewhere. The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline. The Allies achieved and maintained air superiority, which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks. Transport infrastructure in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, {{making it difficult for}} the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies. Much of the opening artillery barrage was off-target or not concentrated enough to have any impact, but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha, providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches. The indecisiveness <b>and</b> <b>overly</b> complicated command structure of the German high command was also a factor in the Allied success.|$|E
