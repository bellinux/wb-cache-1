40|$|Young {{children}} are particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants. They can directly ingest soil by putting dirty hands and objects in their mouths. The reliance on animal derived models {{for human health}} risk and exposure assessment has several limitations. In this investigation, a tool-kit was developed and optimised to facilitate more accurate, reliable and representative predictions of soil contaminants that might pose a significant hazard to young children. The tool-kit was developed and optimised using an in vitro human digestion bioassay. This procedure {{was followed by the}} optimisation of several mutagenicity bioassays to link to the bioaccessible fraction which quantified by the in vitro bioassay. The application of novel and sensitive environmental-based biosensors requires them to work in parallel with effective and proven extraction techniques. In this study, chemical analysis was used to quantify the bioaccessible (human assimilated portion) of pollutants in soils. Acute toxicity was measured using constitutively marked bioluminescent bacterial biosensors and these were indicative of the total contaminant burden. A range of mutagenic assays were applied and optimised. In the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay,</b> any compound exhibiting a greater than two-fold {{increase in the number of}} revertants colonies over the number of spontaneous revertants was considered as a mutagen. Mutagenic-responsive SOS-lux based microbial biosensors were compared to the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay.</b> Mutagenicity assessment of a broad range of environmental pollutants (i. e. B[a]P, DiB(a,h) A, B[a]A, Ni and Cu), was performed using four SOS-lux microbial biosensors; E. coli DPD 1718, E. coli K 12 C 600, S. aureus pAmiUmuC and S. aureus pAmiRecA. The results substantiated that the four biosensors were unable to be induced by these pollutants. Nevertheless, E. coli DPD 1718 and E. coli K 12 C 600 were successfully induced by Mitomycin C (MMC) in a dose response manner. The <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> was performed for the above pollutants in the absence and the presence of the metabolic activation S 9 mix. The standard plate incorporation assay and a modification protocol for the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> were applied. Results reported from the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> confirmed mutagenicity responses of the tested pollutants except Cu and Ni. MMC was selected and introduced into soil samples as a case study to assess the performance of the developed tool-kit. Soils amended with MMC were extracted by the in vitro human digestion bioassay, and the mutagenicity of the bioaccessible fraction was measured using the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> and the biosensors. A comparison was made between the permissible concentrations of MMC obtained from the developed tool-kit and RISC 4 derived concentrations. The four microbial biosensors applied in this study were incapable to detect the mutagenicity of the tested pollutants. On the other hand, the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> was more robust and sensitive to a broad range of environmental pollutants. The in vitro human digestion bioassay enabled the quantification of the human bioaccessible fraction of the tested pollutants. This fraction posed a concern due to its estimation of the doses that would reach the blood circulation and cause harm to human. While the permissible concentration of MMC measured by the developed tool-kit was less than 10 μg MMC/g, the RISC 4 model calculated that it should be 40 μg MMC/g. This revealed that, in this situation, risk assessment model was less conservative than empirical study for human health risk assessment. This study enabled the assessment of the permissible concentrations of environmental pollutants that could remain in a soil and pose permissible harm to humans. This approach also enabled a comparison of modelled and empirical data to allow a measure of sensitivity to be judged. There is a need to develop bioassay techniques more able to assess the potency of hydrophobic compounds both in isolation and combination.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the mutagenic activity of cigarette smoke is mostly based on studies with condensates or extracts in the standard <b>Ames</b> <b>assay.</b> These samples only insufficiently reflect {{the composition of the}} actual generated aerosol. Therefore, such atmospheres should be analysed in their native composition to gain a real signal of its mutagenic capacity. Based on the technical difficulties of testing native air contaminants, there are no accepted methods for effective exposure of bacteria under such conditions. Therefore, we established a new experimental approach for direct exposure of bacteria in a modified CULTEXO (R) system (Patent no. DE 19801763 /PCT/EP 99 / 00295) connected to a smoking machine. This allowed us to investigate the mutagenic activity of native mainstream smoke of the research cigarette K 2 R 4 F by exposure of Salmonella Typhimurium strains. In comparison to studies using the plate incorporation assay, the direct exposure of bacteria to smoke on the agar surface enhances contact to the aerosols. By using this modification of the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay,</b> we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} analyse the effects of native whole smoke and the gas vapour phase of cigarettes directly and achieve a dose-dependent induction of revertants. In a number of experiments, the treatment of strains TA 98 and TA 100 with whole smoke and the gas vapour phase of K 2 R 4 F cigarettes resulted in the induction of revertants dependent on the dilution of smoke and the number of cigarettes smoked.

Two fractions, one enriched in polynuclear aromatic compounds (PNA fraction), and a second fraction enriched in aromatic and heterocyclic amines (basic fraction), were selected for most of this work because of their comparatively high mutagenicity (i. e., compared with raw shale oil). The crude shale oil, as well as the basic, PNA, and tar fractions were mutagenic against the Salmonella typhimurium test strains, TA 98 and TA 100. Mutation was dependent on metabolic activation by microsomal (S 9) enzymes. Both test strains responded equally well to the crude product and to the basic fraction; however, strain TA 100 was more effective than TA 198 in demonstrating the mutagenicity of the PNA fraction. The mutagenicity of the tar fraction could be most easily detected after metabolic activation in a liquid medium, as opposed to S 9 activation in the top agar of the standard <b>Ames</b> <b>assay.</b> The mutagenicity of the basic fraction or 2 -aminoanthracene was also demonstrated by metabolic activation in a liquid medium. In other set of experiments, the effect of chemical composition on the expression of mutagenicity in the standard <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> was estimated.

40|$|A {{large number}} of animal and human {{carcinogens}} without apparent genotoxic activity exist (nonmutagenic carcinogens) that are difficult or impossible to detect with the currently used short-term tests. Because {{of the association of}} carcinogenesis with genome rearrangement, a system selecting for intrachromosomal recombination (DEL recombination) that results in genome rearrangement has been constructed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because DEL recombination is under different genetic control than interchromosomal recombination and meiotic recombination, it is probably due to a different mechanism. It has been found that DEL recombination is readily inducible by 10 mutagenic carcinogens and 17 nonmutagenic carcinogens that are not detectable (false negatives) with the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay.</b> In addition, three out of four mutagens that do not cause cancer (false positives in the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay)</b> do not induce DEL recombination. DEL recombination is inducible by UV only in dividing cells but not in cells synchronized in the G 1 or G 2 phase of the cell cycle. Interchromosomal recombination, on the other hand, is inducible in G 1 but not in G 2. The nonmutagenic carcinogens induce DEL recombination only in actively growing cells, which may give some indication as to their mechanism. Further characterization of the mechanism involved in induction of DEL recombination may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} biological activity of nonmutagenic carcinogens...|$|E
40|$|Porphyrins exhibit potent {{antimutagenic}} {{activity in}} the range of assays in vitro and in vivo. The antimutagenic activities of porphyrin derivatives including phthalocyanines (Pcs) were investigated using 6 -sulfooxymethylbenzo[a]pyrene (SMBP) and its proximate metabolite 6 -hydroxymethylbenzo[a]pyrene (HMBP) in the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> and hypoxanthine:guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) point mutation assay in V 79 cells. Pcs, irrespective of coordinated metal, showed highly antimutagenic activity against both HMBP and SMBP in the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay.</b> However, their inhibitory effects against HMBP were in general less dramatic than against SMBP. Treatment with chlorophyllin (CHL) and protoporphyrin reduced the mutation frequency to 24. 8 % and 19. 1 % of that with SMBP, and 56. 5 % and 40. 7 % of that with HMBP, respectively. Hemin, biliverdin and chlorophylls had a lower antimutagenic activity compared with other porphyrin derivatives although they still retained inhibitory capacity against SMBP. The results of the Ames test for SMBP were extended to the mammalian system to confirm the antimutagenicity of porphyrin derivatives. The antimutagenic strength of porphyrin derivatives was in order of hemin, Pcs, CHL and protoporphyrin. Biliverdin, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b had a little effect against HMBP and SMBP. Among the compounds tested here, hemin had a strong inhibitory effect against SMBP-induced mutation in V 79 cells while Pcs were most effective in the microbial system. It is assumed that these discrepancies are partl...|$|E
40|$|Smoke flavors {{based on}} the thermal {{decomposition}} of wood have been applied {{to a variety of}} food products as an alternative for traditional smoking. Despite its increasing use, the available genotoxic-ity data on wood smoke flavors (WSF) are still controversial. Thus, potential genotoxic effects of WSF in four short-term in vitro genotoxicity assays were investigated, which included the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay,</b> chromosomal aberration assay, micronucleus test and the alkaline comet assay. WSF did not cause any mutation in the <b>Ames</b> <b>assay</b> using five tester strains at six concentrations of 0. 16, 0. 31, 0. 63, 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5 µl/plate. To assess clastogenic effect, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay was performed using Chinese hamster lung cells. No statistically significant {{increase in the number of}} metaphases with structural aberrations was observed at the concentrations of 1. 25, 2. 5, and 5 µl/ml. The in vitro comet assay and micronucleus test results obtained on L 5178 Y cells also revealed that WSF has no genotoxicity potential, although there was a marginal increase in micro-nuclei frequencies and DNA damage in the respective micronucleus and comet assays. Taken together, {{based on the}} results obtained from these four in vitro studies, it is concluded that WSF is not a mutagenic agent in bacterial cells and causes no chromosomal and DNA damage in mamma-lian cells in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydroalcoholic}} extract of Maytenus krukovii bark {{was investigated}} for its in vitro mutageno-protective activities {{by means of}} the <b>Ames</b> Salmonella/microsome <b>assay.</b> The extract showed an inhibitory effect in both T 98 and T 100 strains against the mutagenic activity of promutagen 2 -aminoanthracene but was not protective against directly acting mutagens sodium azide and 2 -nitrofluorene. When tested as a radical scavenger and antioxidant it produced a dose-dependent inhibition. The extract did not show significant antibacterial properties, and was weakly active against dermatophyte and phytopathogenic fungi, but inhibited the growth of phytopathogen Pithyum ultimum.

40|$|The {{combustion}} of hydrocarbon fuels {{generates a}} considerable amount of reaction byproducts, some of which are mutagenic and DNA-reactive nitro-polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This mutagenic action is generally indirect, such that the compounds require metabolic activation for the exertion of their toxic effect. [...] Used motor oil extracts prove more mutagenic than crude oil extracts in the <b>Ames</b> Salmonella <b>assay</b> for mutagenicity. This mutagenic effect is enhanced by the presence of a rat liver microsomal and cytosoiic protein preparation, {{as well as by the}} use of a bacterial strain enriched in O -acetylase activity. The mutagenic response is diminished in a bacterial strain that is deficient in bacterial nitroreductase. These data implicate nitrocompounds as principal agents in the overall mutagenicity of crankcase oil extracts. [...] Crankcase oil extracts prove to be good substrates for nitroreductase enzyme activity in vitro. The effectiveness as a substrate of nitroreductase enzyme(s) also seems to correlate with the mutagenicity as measured in the <b>Ames</b> Salmonella <b>assay.</b> The measured nitroreductase activity exhibits no appreciable difference when NADH or NADPH is used as the reaction cofector. [...] The activity cf nitroreductase enzymes can produce reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals (OH), which can generate single strand nicks in DNA This effect can be initiated by the metabolism of nitrated polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons by mammalian liver enzymes. 1 -nitropyrene and crankcase oil extracts are shown here to be capable of producing such nicks in the DNA of the plasmid pBR 322...|$|R
