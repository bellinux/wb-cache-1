25|$|Kiwifruit {{has since}} become a common name for all commercially grown fruit from the genus <b>Actinidia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Almost all kiwifruit sold {{belong to}} a few cultivars of fuzzy kiwi (<b>Actinidia</b> deliciosa): 'Hayward', 'Blake', and 'Saanichton 12'. They have a fuzzy, dull-brown skin, and bright-green flesh. The {{familiar}} cultivar 'Hayward' was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924. It was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The genus <b>Actinidia</b> {{contains}} around 60 species. Though most kiwifruit {{are easily}} recognized as kiwifruit (due to basic shape) their fruit is quite variable. The {{skin of the}} fruit varies in size, shape, hairiness, and color. The flesh varies in color, juiciness, texture, and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable while others taste considerably better than {{the majority of the}} commercial varieties.|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{features of}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains isolated in Korea {{were compared with}} strains isolated in Japan and Italy. Sequencing of eight P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> and three P. syringae pv. theae strains revealed a total of 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 4, 818 bp of the concatenated alignment of nine genes. A multiplex PCR assay was developed {{for the detection of}} P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> and for the specific detection of recent haplotype strains other than strains isolated since the 1980 s in Korea. The primer pair, designated as TacF and TacR, specifically amplified a 545 -bp fragment with the genomic DNA of new haplotype of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains. A multiplex PCR conducted with the TacF/TacR primer pair and the universal primer pair for all P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains can be simultaneously applied for the detection of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> and for the differentiation of new haplotype strains. Keywards: bacterial canker, kiwifruit, multiplex PCR, PCR detection, Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae,</b> the causal agent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit, was first described in Japan in 1989 (Takikawa et al., 1989) and subsequently reported in Korea (Koh et al., 1994). The bacterial canker was highly destructive, devastating kiwifruit orchards and causing economic losses in both countries. Although this pathogen was isolated in Italy in 1992, it had a limited economic impact with a low incidence on kiwifruit plant...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a rapid, {{sensitive}} and reliable field-based assay for detection of the quarantine pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae,</b> the causal agent of the most destructive and economically important bacterial disease of kiwifruit. A comparative genomic approach was used on the publicly available P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> genomic data to select unique target regions for the development of two loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays able to detect P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> and to discriminate strains belonging to the highly virulent and globally spreading P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> biovar 3. Both LAMP assays showed specificity in accordance to their target and were able to detect reliably 125 CFU per reaction in less than 30 min. The developed assays were able to detect the presence of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> in symptomatic as well as in asymptomatic naturally infected kiwifruit material, thus increasing the potential of the LAMP assays for phytosanitary purposes...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> is the causative {{agent of}} {{bacterial}} canker of kiwifruit. The population of this pathogen is differentiated into three biovars, biovar 1, 2 and 3, {{according to their}} molecular characteristics. In this work, we determined biovars of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains isolated in Korea since 1997 and stored in Department of Biology, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, Korea. The biovars of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains were determined by PCR using biovar specific primers developed previously. Of 682 strains investigated, 288 strains belonged to biovar 2, while 394 strains were biovar 3. There were no P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains belonging to biovar 1 among the strains isolated in Korea. Sudden outbreak and spreading of bacterial canker caused by biovar 3 strain suggest that this strain has character of rapid transmission...|$|R
25|$|Kiwi berries are edible berry- or grape-sized fruits {{similar to}} the fuzzy kiwifruit in taste and appearance, but with thin, smooth green skin. They are {{primarily}} produced by three species of kiwifruit; hardy kiwi (<b>Actinidia</b> arguta), Arctic beauty (A. kolomikta), and silver vine (A. polygama). They are fast-growing, climbing vines, durable over their growing season. They {{are referred to as}} kiwi berry, baby kiwi, dessert kiwi, grape kiwi, or cocktail kiwi.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} dacha fruits in cool {{temperate}} regions of Russia are apple, blackcurrant, redcurrant, gooseberry, raspberry and strawberry (sometimes also sour cherry, downy cherry, plum, pear, sea-buckthorn, <b>Actinidia</b> kolomikta, black chokeberry, serviceberry, sweetberry honeysuckle, blackberry and grape, {{but many of}} them are either rare or not hardy enough and require winter protection). Popular vegetables and herbs are potato, cucumber, zucchini, pumpkin, tomato, carrot, beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, turnip, onion, garlic, dill, parsley, rhubarb and sorrel.|$|E
25|$|The golden kiwifruit (<b>Actinidia</b> chinensis) has a smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at {{the stem}} attachment. Flesh color varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is sweeter and more {{aromatic}} in flavor; the flavor {{is reminiscent of}} some subtropical fruit. Its short storage life currently limits its commercial potential. One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around {{the center of the}} fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit fetches a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwifruit, is more palatable for consumption without peeling.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 37 strains of Pseudomonas avellanae, P. syringae pv. theae and P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae,</b> {{including}} pathotype and reference strains, obtained {{from all the}} countries where these pathogens have been reported, were compared by means of ARDRA, repetitive PCR using ERIC, BOX and REP primer sets, whole-cell protein analysis, biochemical and nutritional tests, and pathogenicity tests. P. syringae pathovar type strains representing six genomospecies sensu Gardan et al. (1999), were also included for comparison in UPGMA cluster analysis of repetitive PCR data and SDS-PAGE of protein extracts. Among the 12 endonucleases used in ARDRA, only Tru 9 I differentiated P. avellanae from P. s. pv. theae and P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae.</b> UPGMA cluster analysis of repetitive PCR genomic fingerprints showed 65 % similarity between P. s. pv. theae and P. avellanae and 50 % between the latter species and P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae.</b> Strains of P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae</b> could be grouped according to their geographic origin. Similar results were obtained with SDS-PAGE cluster analysis. PCR amplification using primers PAV 1 and PAV 22 that were developed to detect P. avellanae in apparently healthy and visibly infected hazelnut specimens yielded a band of 762 bp from all strains of P. avellanae, P. s. pv. theae and P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae.</b> All strains lacked the syrB gene. Based on these data, we suggest that P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae</b> {{should be included in}} the genomospecies 8 together with P. avellanae and P. s. pv. theae. Selected biochemical and nutritional tests could differentiate these groups of strains. Pathogenicity tests clearly indicated that each group is specifically pathogenic only on the host plant species from which it was originally isolated...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains, {{the causal}} agents of {{bacterial}} canker on kiwifruit, were isolated from Korea and Italy in 2011. Among 87 isolates, {{a total of}} six representative strains, three from Korea and three from Italy, were identified on the basis of biochemical and physiological tests. Identities were confirmed by PCR using P. syringae pv. actinidiae-specific primers PsaF 1 /R 2, which amplified a 280 -bp DNA fragment. The strains isolated from Korea in this study displayed BOX-PCR patterns similar to those isolated from Italy but different from those isolated previously in Korea or the pathotype P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strain. The effector hopA 1 and hopH 1 genes, which are known to be present in strains isolated recently from France and Italy, were also present in P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains, SYS 1, SYS 2 and SYS 4, isolated from Korea in this work. However, no amplicons of the expected size were obtained from strains previously isolated from Korea and Japan. In addition, the Korean strains isolated in this work belonged to haplotype I for the cts gene identical to those strains isolated from recent outbreaks in Italy. These results suggest that P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> strains isolated from Korea and examined in this work are a new type of strain similar to those found from recent outbreaks in Italy. This is the first report on the occurrence of cts haplotype I strains of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> affecting kiwifruit plants in Korea...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} canker of kiwifruit {{caused by}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> is a severe threat to kiwifruit production worldwide. Many aspects of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> biology and epidemiology still require in-depth investigation. The infection by and spread of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> in xylem and phloem was investigated by carrying out artificial inoculation experiments with histological and dendrochronological analyses of naturally diseased plants in Italy. We {{found that the}} bacterium can infect host plants by entering natural openings and lesions. In naturally infected kiwifruit plants, P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> {{is present in the}} lenticels {{as well as in the}} dead phloem tissue beneath the lenticels, surrounded by a lesion in the periderm which appears to indicate the importance of lenticels to kiwifruit infection. Biofilm formation was observed outside and inside plants. In cases of advanced stages of P. syringae pv. <b>actinidiae</b> infection, neuroses of the phloem occur, which are followed by cambial dieback and most likely by infection of the xylem. Anatomical changes in wood such as reduced ring width, a drastic reduction in vessel size, and the presence of tyloses were observed within several infected sites. In the field, these changes occur only a year after the first leaf symptoms are observed suggesting a significant time lapse between primary and secondary symptoms. It was possible to study the temporal development of P. syringae pv. actinidiae-induced cambial dieback by applying dendrochronology methods which revealed that cambial dieback occurs only during the growing season...|$|R
500|$|Cats have {{an acute}} sense of smell, {{due in part}} to their {{well-developed}} olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about [...] in area, which is about twice that of humans. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion. [...] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (<b>Actinidia</b> polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|Kiwifruit (often {{abbreviated}} as kiwi) or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berries {{of several}} species of woody vines in the genus <b>Actinidia.</b> The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit ('Hayward') is oval, {{about the size of}} a large hen's egg ( [...] in length and [...] in diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture and a sweet but unique flavor.

The phytotoxic exopolysaccharides, which are natural antigens, were used to arise specific antibodies by rat immunization. The antibodies were used to develop a rapid and specific method to unambiguously detect P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae</b> exopolysaccharides isolated from bacterial culture and infected plant samples. Indeed, the antibodies recognized the exopolysaccharides produced by other two strains of P. s. pv. <b>actinidiae</b> but did not cross reacted with those isolated from P. s. pv. syringae and Pseudomonas viridiflava culture filtrates. Finally, the same antibodies significantly recognized the exopolysaccharides extracted from infected kiwi leaves...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, a severe {{bacterial}} disease affecting kiwifruit {{has been reported in}} Italy.

Profiles were generated by rep-PCR ((GTG) 5 -PCR), IS 50 -PCR and RAPD, from a wide collection of Italian, Korean and Japanese strains. The genetic relationships between strains of pv. <b>actinidiae</b> and strains from related pathovars were investigated. No differences between Italian strains were identified. However, some differences were identified between Italian strains and strains from Japan and Korea.
