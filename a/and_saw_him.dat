5|$|He {{joined the}} Lodge of Antiquity in London in 1863, and {{that same year}} became Grand Chaplain of United Grand Lodge. While still Rector of Swillington, his new masonic duties {{took him to the}} consecration of many new lodges, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> deliver the oration at the laying of the {{foundation}} stone for the new extension to Freemason's Hall in Great Queen Street, London, the next year. In the same period, Woodford started to contribute articles on masonic history, starting with his researches into the old York lodges. He became known to local booksellers as he began to collect old manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used as}} the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> return at midnight.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E

25|$|In July 2004, Tait {{was signed}} by Durham {{for the second half}} of the English County Championship season. His first match was against a Somerset side captained by Ricky Ponting. His County debut was a poor one <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> take 0/113 off 12 overs {{including}} 21 no balls. Tait only played one more first-class match for Durham before flying home again.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the one-sided {{nature of}} the series led to David Gower {{standing}} down as captain, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> replaced with Graham Gooch prior to the next series against the West Indies in the Caribbean. The England side went on a down turn, and despite featuring as losing finalists in the 1992 Cricket World Cup three years later, struggled for consistency {{for much of the}} next decade.|$|E
25|$|Matthews {{was picked}} in the Australian one day team. However Shane Warne was {{drafted into the}} Australian 12 for the second test and {{although}} Matthews took 4-25 against South Australia for NSW in a Sheffield Shield game prior to the test Warne was preferred to Matthews for the final eleven. Warne's 7-52 in the second innings helped Australia win the game <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> become Australia's first choice spinner.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{looked up}} over my {{shoulder}} from the table at which I was sitting <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} front of his face and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 season saw injury {{restrict}} Kirby to {{just nine}} first-class matches <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> take 24 wickets {{at an average}} of just over 30. Prior to the 2013 season, Kirby was included in the MCC squad for the Champion County fixture, for the fourth time in his career. The season again saw Kirby limited to just 10 first-class matches due to injury despite this he took 26 wickets {{at an average of}} 35.11. The end of the 2013 season saw Kirby sign a new contract of undisclosed length with Somerset.|$|E
25|$|His {{second season}} (1991) was even better, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> defend the 125 title fairly comfortably. He was only once {{off the front}} row of the grid, and had five pole positions, as well as four fastest laps. From {{thirteen}} rounds, he was on the rostrum for twelve, and finished sixth in the other. He came second five times, and was a winner in Australia, Malaysia, and three European venues. His 225 points, 200 of them counted, were enough to help him move up to the 250cc class.|$|E

25|$|The {{grandmaster}} of the goldsmiths guild, Andreas Holm, {{suspected that}} Heidenreich had been involved, {{since he had}} tried to sell Holm forged “pagodas” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with brass. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May 2008, Fry gave {{a speech}} {{as part of a}} series of BBC lectures on the future of public service {{broadcasting}} in the United Kingdom, which he later recorded for a podcast. His six-part travel series Stephen Fry in America began on BBC One in October 2008, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> travel to each of the 50 US states. In the same year, he narrated the nature documentaries Spectacled Bears: Shadow of the Forest for the BBC Natural World series. In the 2009 television series Last Chance to See, Fry and zoologist Mark Carwardine sought out endangered species, some of which had been featured in Douglas Adams' and Carwardine's 1990 book and radio series of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Cooper, {{along with}} newly {{appointed}} captain Tana Umaga, helped to mould the inconsistent and ill-disciplined Hurricanes {{into one of}} the top teams in the competition. 2003 {{was the beginning of a}} new era for the Hurricanes as they reached the semi-finals for just the second time in their history on the back of a strong seven-game winning streak mid-season. Their success came partly with the break-out year for mid-fielder Ma'a Nonu, his strong performances and partnership with captain Tana Umaga pushed out former All Black Pita Alatini <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> score six tries en route to the All Black squad. The team also benefited from the steady hand of David Holwell at first five-eighth and an improving and mobile forward pack.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to Oberst (colonel) in 1942, Mikosch was {{commander}} of the 677th Pioneer Regiment, which {{took part in the}} Battle of Stalingrad <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, and the following year, was temporary {{commander of}} the 10th Panzergrenadier Division from late July to late December, during which it fought in Operation Citadel and the Battle of Kiev. He then took command of the 13th Panzer Division on 23 December. His new command, which had been heavily engaged on the Eastern Front, was withdrawn from the front and underwent a refit. During this time he was promoted to Generalmajor (equivalent to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Army). On its return to the front, the 13th Panzer Division took part in the Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket and the subsequent retreat to the Bug River.|$|E
25|$|In September 1909, Erhardt {{was staying}} at the Union League Club while his wife, Nora Belle Jewett, was visiting their {{daughter}} at York Harbor, Maine {{for part of the}} summer. He had told his private secretary that he had not been feeling well, believing he may have developed rheumatism, and his friends at the club noticed that he had been in ill health during the last month but appeared well while staying at the club. On the morning of September 7, at about 1:00a.m., the club watchman was passing Erhardt's room <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> sitting at the side of his bed. Erhardt told them to get a doctor at once. His family physician, Dr. John Solley, was called from his home on West Fifty-Eighth Street but Erhardt died at 1.20a.m. At the time of his death, he was the president of the Lawyers' Surety Company and a director in a number of corporations.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, Chanderpaul {{recorded}} his second highest score in ODI cricket, hitting 149 not {{out in a}} losing cause against India. Later that year, he was the top-scorer for the West Indies during their series against England, aggregating 446 runs in three Tests {{at an average of}} almost 150. His achievements during the series earned him the man of the series accolade, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He was especially praised by Wisden for his third instance of batting for 1,000 or more minutes without being dismissed, and for his century in the third Test on a difficult pitch. He scored another century in the fourth match of the series, and was named as the man of the match, despite an England victory. His performances throughout 2007 resulted in him being one of four players short-listed for the ICC Player of the Year award, which was eventually won by Ricky Ponting.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he went up}} {{stairs and}} shut himself up in his own room, <b>and</b> Luke <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> no more that day.|$|R

25|$|Murray then competed at the Australian Open. He got his {{campaign}} underway in difficult conditions, with temperatures {{in excess of}} 40 degrees Celsius, against Go Soeda <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> off in under 90 minutes, only dropping five games in the process. He next faced qualifier Vincent Millot and again won in straight sets, recovering from 5–1 down in the third to take it 7–5 by winning 23 consecutive points from set point down. Murray's first serious test came from Feliciano López but the top 30 player failed to trouble him as he secured another three set victory, {{to set up a}} fourth round clash with lucky loser Stéphane Robert. Murray dropped his first set of the tournament in a third set tie-break but recovered to take the fourth and progress to the quarter-finals. There he faced Roger Federer, in their fifth meeting at a Grand Slam. Murray was unable to match Federer's level throughout most of the match and was defeated in four sets, ending his run of four consecutive Australian Open semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|Beckham {{returned}} to Old Trafford {{for the second}} leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match {{was the first time}} Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2. Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.|$|E
25|$|Booths second defence of {{the title}} took place in Sunderland <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{headline}} the bill against Hartlepool fighter Michael Hunter, a former holder of the belt and European champion at the weight. Booth was able to dominate the fight from the bell and Hunter made {{the decision not to}} come out for the 5th round handing victory to the champion. Booth's third defence {{of the title}} was against another former champion in Matthew Marsh. Marsh had vacated the title with the intention of taking a break from the sport and upon his return had won two contests. For Booth, a win over Marsh would mean the Lonsdale Belt would be his for keeps after making three successful defences. The fight, in Nottingham on 5 February 2010, resulted in a stoppage decision for Booth when the fight was called off in the 11th round following a severe gash to Marsh's eye. The win not only meant the Lonsdale belt but also the vacant Commonwealth title, which was also on the line, would be held by Booth meaning that Booth had now won the Commonwealth title at three different weights.|$|E
