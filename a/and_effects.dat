5|$|While {{director}} of photography Paddy Seale and special effects supervisor Derek Meddings handled Thunderbirds Are Go, camera <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> roles for Series Two were delegated to their assistants, Julien Lugrin and Jimmy Elliott. Two unused {{buildings on the}} Slough Trading Estate were purchased to address the increased demands on the production team, combining with the pre-existing puppet workshop and art department and publicity centres to form an AP Films production base of five buildings. Converted by January 1966, one of these former factory units contained new puppet stages, while the other was dedicated to one large sound stage on which all model <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> work would be completed.|$|E
5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the colours <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> they need.|$|E
5|$|Animation {{director}} Toshihiko Nishikubo {{was responsible}} for the realism and strove for accurate depictions of movement <b>and</b> <b>effects.</b> The pursuit of realism included the staff conducting firearms research at a facility in Guam.

5000|$|The {{point of}} the koan {{is that for the}} {{ordinary}} person the two conflicting views of causality are between falling into cause <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> or not falling into cause <b>and</b> <b>effect,</b> because they dream of being free from cause <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> as being separate from cause <b>and</b> <b>effect.</b> But when a person awakens to their true nature he/she sees the oneness of cause <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> therefore that person does not [...] "darken", [...] "obscure", or [...] "ignore" [...] (昧, mei4) the functioning of cause <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> by imagining cause <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> are two separate things, that cause <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> is separate from one's Buddha nature.

5|$|Jerry Fodor, Putnam, {{and others}} noted that, along with being an {{effective}} argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively {{in terms of}} causes <b>and</b> <b>effects,</b> abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore {{seemed to be a}} better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E

40|$|Failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} in manufacturing and service industries but can still be improved. Failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> analysis is a common tool used to evaluate risk priority number; however, numerous scholars have doubted the effectiveness of failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> analysis <b>and</b> have thus proposed methods for correcting failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> analysis from its conventional formula. Because implemented actions can determine or influence resource allocation <b>and</b> its <b>effects,</b> completing one corrective action can occasionally simultaneously improve various failure modes. In this study, failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> analysis <b>and</b> decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory were integrated to correct failure modes and increase their effectiveness. First, failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> analysis was employed to identify the items for improvement. Second, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory was adopted to examine the reciprocal influences and causality among these items. Finally, the priority for improving the items was proposed. By combining the advantages of failure mode <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> analysis <b>and</b> decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, this research method complemented the shortcomings of the two techniques. According to the empirical research of this case study in which decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory was employed to analyze the causality among the items of the failure modes, the malfunction of production lines can be solved faster and more effectively compared with merely considering the size of risk priority number values...|$|R

5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> crews.|$|E
