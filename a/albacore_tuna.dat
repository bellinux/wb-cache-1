5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, <b>albacore</b> <b>tuna,</b> and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{study using}} sonar in French Polynesia, found large shoals of {{juvenile}} bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna aggregated {{closest to the}} devices, 10 to 50 m. Further out, 50 to 150 m, was a less dense group of larger yellowfin and <b>albacore</b> <b>tuna.</b> Yet further out, to 500 m, was a dispersed group of various large adult tuna. The distribution and density of these groups was variable and overlapped. The FADs were also used by other fish, and the aggregations dispersed when it was dark.|$|E

Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, <b>albacore</b> <b>tuna,</b> and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

Interesting patterns were found between regions and fleets that might provide insights into targeting behaviour and the potential for hyperstability (i. e. increasing catchability as abundance declines).

2500|$|Tuna is {{the most}} {{important}} fish in Hawaiian cuisine. Varieties include the skipjack tuna (aku), the yellowfin tuna (ahi), and the <b>albacore</b> <b>tuna</b> (tombo). Ahi in particular has a long history, since ancient Hawaiians used it on long ocean voyages because it is well preserved when salted and dried. A large portion of the local tuna fishery goes to Japan to be sold for sashimi. [...] Tuna is eaten as sashimi in Hawaii as well, but is also grilled or sautéed, or made into poke.|$|E

40|$|Rent {{generated}} by the tuna fisheries occurring {{in the waters of}} Pacific Islands Nations is estimated for various levels and combinations of purse-seine, pole-and-line, frozen tuna longline, and fresh tuna longline fishing effort, using a multi-species, multi-fleet bioeconomic model. The underlying population model integrates available information on the population dynamics of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and Southern <b>albacore</b> <b>tunas</b> in the Pacific Ocean. The economic model utilizes the most recent data on fishing effort costs for the purse seine, pole-and-line, and longline fleets operating in the western and central Pacific Ocean, along with recent estimates of prices by species, method of capture and market, and estimates of demand elasticities. The results of the model indicate that fishery rent could be increased substantially above the current level by decreasing the size of all fleets, {{with the possible exception of}} the tuna longline fleet. The results also suggest that the countries of the region could benefit significantly by changing the level and structure of access fees levied as a percentage of total catch revenue.

Research location is in Indian Ocean 070 - 210 S and 1070 - 1210 E. Weekly satellite data in 2007 used are chlorophyl, sea surface temperature, Photosynthetic Available Radiation (PAR) and euphotic zone (Zeu) data. Daily fisheries data is from tuna fish catching data 2007 in PT. Perikanan Samudera Besar (PT. PSB). Satellite data is processed by Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) formula to obtained primary productivity. Tuna fish catching data correlated to satellite data to know correlation of primary productivity value to fish catching data. Result {{of this research}} is there four species of tuna fish catch in Indian Ocean, that are Madidihang or Yellowfin <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus <b>albacores),</b> Bigeye <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus obesus), Southtern Bluefin tuna (Thunnus macoyii), and Albacore (Thunnus alalunga).

For this reason, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends limiting consumption (especially for women of childbearing age) of certain (predatory) fish species (e.g. <b>albacore</b> <b>tuna,</b> shark, king mackerel, tilefish and swordfish) due to high levels of the toxic contaminant mercury.

40|$|Research PaperNew Zealand’s $ 25 M (USD) {{domestic}} tuna fishery comprises a troll fishery for albacore, a longline fishery {{for southern}} bluefin, Pacific bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin, and <b>albacore</b> <b>tunas,</b> {{and a small}} purse seine fishery for skipjack tuna. New Zealand vessels also fish for tuna in high seas areas and, through arrangements with other governments, in the fishery management zones of some Pacific Island Nations. Unlike other major New Zealand domestic fisheries, tuna fisheries have been open access. New Zealand domestic tuna fisheries are constrained by the availability of tuna in New Zealand fisheries waters and the longline fishery in particular has been characterised by overcapacity and poor economic returns. Following a recent review of management options, the New Zealand Government decided to manage its tuna fisheries using Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs). ITQ management will initially apply to all major tuna fisheries within New Zealand fisheries waters and, where a national allocation is agreed through the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organization, for tuna species taken by New Zealand fishers outside New Zealand fisheries waters. Total allowable commercial catches (TACCs) will reflect agreed national allocations. Where national allocations have not been set, TACCs will be set {{so as not to}} constrain fishing unduly, while ensuring sustainability of the stocks. Voluntary rationalization of the tuna fishing fleet commenced soon after the announcement of ITQ management. As expected, the initial allocation of ITQs has proved contentious with different fishers promoting the use of different catch history years as a basis for quota allocation...|$|R

5000|$|The {{harvest of}} <b>albacore</b> <b>tuna</b> for {{commercial}} use {{began at the}} start of the 20th century. The migratory patterns of the fish brought droves of albacore schools near the coastline of southern California, which sparked the start of commercial albacore fishing. In 1903, 700 cases of albacore were used as an experimental pack which ultimately lead to the development of the U.S. tuna-canning industry. The experiment was a huge success, and the commercial fishery expanded rapidly due to the high level of demand for canned tuna. By the 1920s, the industry expanded further and three other species of tuna, bluefin, yellowfin, and skipjack, were also being canned. <b>Albacore</b> <b>tuna</b> is the only species that can be marketed as [...] "white meat tuna".
