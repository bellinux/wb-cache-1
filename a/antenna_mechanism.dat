40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{show that}} fast radio bursts (FRBs) are energetic but probably non-catastrophic events occurring at cosmological distances. The properties of their progenitors are largely unknown {{in spite of}} many attempts to determine them using the event rate, duration and energetics. Understanding the radiation mechanism for FRBs should provide the missing insights regarding their progenitors, which is investigated in this paper. The high brightness temperatures (> 10 ^{ 35 } K) of FRBs mean that the emission process must be coherent. Two general classes of coherent radiation mechanisms are considered [...] - maser and the <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We use the observed properties of the repeater FRB 121102 to constrain the plasma conditions needed for these two mechanisms. We have looked into {{a wide variety of}} maser mechanisms operating in either vacuum or plasma and find that none of them can explain the high luminosity of FRBs without invoking unrealistic or fine-tuned plasma conditions. The most favorable mechanism is antenna curvature emission by coherent charge bunches where the burst is powered by magnetic reconnection near the surface of a magnetar (B > 10 ^{ 14 } G). We show that the plasma in the twisted magnetosphere of a magnetar may be clumpy due to two-stream instability. When magnetic reconnection occurs, the pre-existing density clumps may provide charge bunches for the <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism</b> to operate. This model should be applicable to all FRBs that have multiple outbursts like FRB 121102. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcom...|$|E
40|$|In {{the focus}} of this study, {{mixtures}} of commercially available TiO 2 powders were created and their photocatalytic activity concerning the acetaldehyde degradation in the gas phase was tested. Further, the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers was analyzed by Laser-Flash-Photolysis-Spectroscopy. The acetaldehyde degradation experiments of the mixed powders lead to positive and negative deviations from the expected weighted mean. Nevertheless, their photocatalytic activity could be correlated with the lifetime of the charge carriers. A longer charge carrier lifetime at ambient conditions correlated with a lower fractional conversion of acetaldehyde. The advantageous activities of the samples were associated with a charge transfer reaction between larger and smaller particles comparable to the <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism.</b> © 2016 SPIE...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT TiO 2 {{photocatalysis}} {{has attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention during the last three decades. One major goal in this field is the design and preparation of TiO 2 based photocatalysts possessing high photocatalytic activity to satisfy the requirements for practical applications. For the development of successful strategies to achieve this goal it is of utmost importance to improve the mechanistic understanding of the basic principles of photocatalysis. Therefore, various nanosized TiO 2 photocatalysts including pure TiO 2, Fe(III) -doped TiO 2 and platinized TiO 2 have been synthesized in our laboratories and their photocatalytic activity has been studied in detail. In particular, the correlation between the structural characteristics of these newly synthesized catalysts and their photocatalytic activity has been addressed. To explain the unexpected behavior of these materials novel mechanistic principles, i. e., the <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the so-called de-aggregation concept have been developed and will be explained in this review. 1...|$|E
40|$|Microwave-based head imaging systems demand {{wideband}} antennas with compact size. To ensure high scattered {{signals from}} the intended target point, the antennas need to have directional radiation patterns. Designing an antenna by addressing all these issues is challenging as the head imaging system utilizes low microwave frequencies (around 1 - 3 GHz) to maintain high signal penetration in the lossy human head. This paper reports a coplanar waveguide-fed design that overcomes all these limitations. The antenna is constructed in a three-dimensional manner by combining a dipole antenna with a folded parasitic structure printed on two substrate blocks. The <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism</b> is explained with the description of its design parameters. The antenna covers 101 % fractional bandwidth with a stable gain, good radiation efficiency and well directional radiation characteristics. The overall volume of the antenna is 0. 24 x 0. 1 x 0. 05 lambda(m) where lambda(m) is the wavelength at the lowest frequency of operation...|$|E

NigeriaSAT- 2 is a high performance Earth Observation mission designed for a 7. 5 year lifetime to achieve 2. 5 m imagery in a panchromatic waveband along with 5 m and 32 m imagery in four mutli-spectral channels. The spacecraft will deliver high data throughput on an agile platform, whilst still maintaining high levels of pointing accuracy during downlink opportunities. All of this will be included in a 300 Kg satellite. The innovative <b>Antenna</b> Pointing <b>Mechanism</b> developed by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited incorporates a compact circularly polarized antenna with a narrow 3 dB beam-width of 25 degrees and bore-sight gain of 15 dBiC. It also houses the necessary drive electronics and structural elements to provide a nimble, 2 -axis antenna solution. The pointing accuracy of the unit is better than 1 degree and the maximum slew rate is better than 20 deg/s, at acceleration rates up to 4 deg/s/s. Such low-cost and compact yet agile antenna systems have not been used previously on small satellite missions and as such, the <b>Antenna</b> Pointing <b>Mechanism</b> is an enabling technology in the commercialization of small Earth Observation spacecraft missions. Numerous design trades were made along the development path of the <b>Antenna</b> Pointing <b>Mechanism</b> and these are covered in this paper.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{abilities and}} operations of {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) are described. SAR employs long wavelength radio waves in bursts, imaging a target by 'listening' to the small frequency changes that result from the Doppler shift due to the relative motion of the imaging craft and the motions of the target. The time delay of the signal return allows a determination of {{the location of the}} target, leading to the build up of a two-dimensional image. The uses of both Doppler shifts and time delay enable detailed imagery which is independent of distance. The synthetic aperture part of the name of SAR derives from the beaming of multiple pulses, which result in a picture that is effectively the same as using a large <b>antenna.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> contributing to the fineness of SAR images are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Actin cables are linear cytoskeletal {{structures}} {{that serve as}} tracks for myosin-based intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles in both yeast and mammalian cells. In a yeast cell undergoing budding, cables are in constant dynamic turnover yet some cables grow from the bud neck {{toward the back of}} the mother cell until their length roughly equals the diameter of the mother cell. This raises the question: how is the length of these cables controlled? Here we describe a novel molecular mechanism for cable length control inspired by recent experimental observations in cells. This "antenna mechanism" involves three key proteins: formins, which polymerize actin, Smy 1 proteins, which bind formins and inhibit actin polymerization, and myosin motors, which deliver Smy 1 to formins, leading to a length-dependent actin polymerization rate. We compute the probability distribution of cable lengths as a function of several experimentally tuneable parameters such as the formin-binding affinity of Smy 1 and the concentration of myosin motors delivering Smy 1. These results provide testable predictions of the <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism</b> of actin-cable length control...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen yield from single {{turnover}} £ashes {{and multiple}} turnover pulses {{was measured in}} sun£ower leaves di¡erently pre-illuminated to induce either ènergy-dependent type ’ non-photochemical excitation quenching (qE) or reversible, inhibitory type non-photochemical quenching (qI). A zirconium O 2 analyser, combined with a £exible gas system, was used for these measurements. Oxygen yield from saturating single turnover £ashes {{was the equivalent of}} 1. 3 ^ 2. 0 m mol e 7 m 72 in leaves pre-adapted to low light. It did not decrease when qE quenching was induced by a 1 min exposure to saturating light, but it decreased when pre-illumination was extended to 30 ^ 60 min. Oxygen evolution from saturating multiple turnover pulses behaved similarly: it did not decrease with the rapidly induced qE but decreased considerably when exposure to saturating light was extended or O 2 concentration was decreased to 0. 4 %. Parallel recording of chlorophyll £uorescence and O 2 evolution during multiple turnover pulses, interpreted {{with the help of a}} mathematical model of photosystem II (PS II) electron transport, revealed PS II donor and acceptor side resistances. These experiments showed that PS II properties depend on the type of non-photochemical quenching present. The rapidly induced and rapidly reversible qE type (photoprotective) quenching does not induce changes in the number of active PS II or in the PS II maximum turnover rate, thus con¢rming the <b>antenna</b> <b>mechanism</b> of qE. The more slowly induced but still reversible qI type quenching (photoinactivation) induced a decrease in the number of active PS II and in the maximum PS II turnover rate.

40|$|With the {{increasingly}} new ultra wide-band applications, antenna researchers face huge challenges in designing novel operational geometries. Mono-pole and quasi-mono-pole antennas {{are seen to}} be the most compact and easily incorporate able solution for portable devices taking the advantages of printed circuit board (PCB) techniques. Most antennas of such type have symmetrical structures. It is possible to attain wider operating bandwidths by meeting symmetry conditions while chopping the antenna into halves for a compact structure. However, there is no generalized way of applying such a technique. The presented paper addresses this issue by proposing a common feeding technique that can be applied to any antenna which is miniaturized using its symmetrical structure. The proposed technique enables feeding the halved structure to achieve wider and better impedance matching than the reported full-size antennas. The theory of characteristic modes is applied to quasi-mono-pole structures to get an insight of the <b>antennas</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The radiation patterns are also correlated with modal current distributions to understand the radiation characteristics of the modified structure. Lastly, the method is implemented on some example antennas to illustrate its potential. Comment: Accepted for publication in IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazin...|$|R

30|$|Joint {{clearances}} in <b>antenna</b> pointing <b>mechanisms</b> lead to {{uncertainty in}} function deviation. Current studies mainly focus on radial clearance of revolute joints, while axial clearance {{has rarely been}} taken into consideration. In fact, owning to errors from machining and assembly, thermal deformation and so forth, practically, axial clearance is inevitable in the joint. In this study, an error equivalent model (EEM) of revolute joints is proposed with considering both radial and axial clearances. Compared to the planar model of revolute joints only considering radial clearance, the journal motion inside the bearing is more abundant and matches the reality better in the EEM. The model is also extended for analyzing the error distribution of a spatial dual-axis (“X–Y” type) <b>antenna</b> pointing <b>mechanism</b> of Spot-beam <b>antennas</b> which especially demand a high pointing accuracy. Three case studies are performed which illustrates the internal relation between radial clearance and axial clearance. It is found that when the axial clearance is big enough, the physical journal can freely realize both translational motion and rotational motion. While if the axial clearance is limited, {{the motion of the}} physical journal will be restricted. Analysis results indicate that the consideration of both radial and axial clearances in the revolute joint describes the journal motion inside the bearing more precise. To further validate the proposed model, a model of the EEM is designed and fabricated. Some suggestions on the design of revolute joints are also provided.|$|R
