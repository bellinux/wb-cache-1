5|$|Following No Surrender, Raven {{went on to}} {{feud with}} Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Jarrett and Rhino {{attacked}} Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, claiming he had no allies to help him. On the July 29 episode of Impact!, Jarrett and Rhino attacked Cassidy Riley as well, until Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team {{with him in a}} Tag Team match to face Jarrett and Rhino at TNA's next PPV event Sacrifice on August 14. Sabu then appeared attacking Jarrett and Rhino with Raven. At Sacrifice, NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko added a stipulation to the encounter, in which if Jarrett pinned Raven he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, however, if Raven pinned Jarrett then he would not garner one for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> The team of Jarrett and Rhino won the contest at the event, with Rhino gaining the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year,</b> most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
5|$|Johns Hopkins University, located {{north of}} the Naval Academy, in Baltimore, started their {{football}} program a couple years after Navy. Hopkins' first team was assembled in 1881, and spent <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> training and learning {{a version of the}} game. Their sport, which was closer to rugby, was played in Druid Hill Park. After the training, the team planned a two-game 1882 season. The squad had to play the season under the title of the Clifton Athletic Club, due to the school's policy on the sport of football. The first was a practice game with the Baltimore Athletic Club, played on October 7. The Hopkins team lost the contest 4–0. The following game was their first true game, to be played against the Naval Academy.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette {{was held}} at Nivelles, then {{transferred}} to Luxembourg where a coalition military tribunal declared him, de Pusy, and two others to be prisoners of state for their roles in the Revolution. The tribunal ordered them held until a restored French king could render final judgment on them. On 12 September 1792, pursuant to the tribunal's order, the prisoners were transferred to Prussian custody. The party travelled to the Prussian fortress-city of Wesel, where the Frenchmen remained in verminous individual cells in the central citadel from 19 September to 22 December 1792. When victorious French revolutionary troops began to threaten the Rhineland, King Frederick WilliamII transferred the prisoners east to the citadel at Magdeburg, where they remained <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year,</b> from 4 January 1793 to 4 January 1794.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} bout on {{the card}} was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Rhino. At Sacrifice, Raven teamed with Sabu to face the team of Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. On the pre-show of the gathering, Zbyszko announced if Jarrett pinned Raven during the contest then he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. However, he added that if Raven pinned Jarrett during the contest then Jarrett would not have another title match for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> Rhino ended up pinning Raven at the event, with TNA declaring him number-one contender on their website after the show. Tenay promoted Raven versus Rhino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Unbreakable on the August19 episode of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Vietnam's {{colonisation}} began in 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam {{and attempted to}} proceed to the capital Hue. After becoming tied down, they sailed to the less defended south, targeting Saigon. The southern offensive started on February 10, 1859 with a naval bombardment of Vũng Tàu. Within six days, the Europeans had levelled 12 Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers. They then sailed along the Saigon River {{to the mouth of}} the Citadel of Saigon and opened fire with naval artillery from close range. The fort was manned by 1,000 soldiers and stored enough rice to feed 10,000 defenders for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{producers}} of Château-Chalon are very particular about quality and will sacrifice <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year's</b> production, {{not making any}} wine, if the weather of a particular vintage was not favorable.

50|$|In {{spite of}} criticisms about its racial stereotyping, The Green Pastures {{proved to be}} an {{enormously}} popular film. On its opening day at New York's Radio City Music Hall, tickets sold at a rate of 6,000 per hour. The film was held over for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year's</b> run at some theaters. It remained the highest grossing all-black cast film until the release of Carmen Jones in 1954.|$|R
50|$|To {{pass the}} bona fide {{residency}} test, the individual needs to reside within {{a foreign country}} for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> tax <b>year,</b> defined as January 1 through December 31. The individual is allowed to leave this country for brief trips back to the U.S, or somewhere else for either vacation or business.

The individual's bona fide residence can include <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> tax <b>year</b> and parts of two other tax years.|$|R
5|$|William {{returned}} to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly {{returned to}} Normandy, {{where he spent}} all of 1074. He left England {{in the hands of}} his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.|$|E
5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a necklace and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds. It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> to collect the perfectly matched stones. The necklace has nine large oblong aquamarines with an even bigger aquamarine pendant drop. The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match the necklace. The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines. Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching tiara made, the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift, and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of oblong aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds, and a square aquamarine and diamond brooch.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese clan or lineage {{involved}} men {{who shared}} a common patrilineal ancestor, yet were divided into subgroups whose behavior towards each other was regulated according to Confucian mores which dictated what relative should be closer and more intimate. The four different subgroups were: (1) brother, brother's sons, and brother's grandsons; (2) father's brothers, father's brother's sons and grandsons; (3) paternal grandfather's brothers, their sons, and grandsons; and (4) paternal great-grandfather's brothers, their sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons. While one was expected to mourn for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> {{over the death of}} any relative in the first subgroup, one was expected to mourn for only five months when a relative in the second subgroup had died. No ritual mourning was expected at all for relatives in the third and fourth subgroups. While a son mourned three years for a father's death, he only mourned one year for his mother's. Since carrying on the patrilineal line meant the continuation of ancestor worship, it was important to have at least one son, even if he was adopted from another family (although it was considered imperative that he share the same surname, otherwise his ancestral sacrifices could be considered null and void).|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{given that}} {{bankruptcies}} {{and real estate}} did much worse in Alberta than {{in other parts of}} Canada and the United States, petroleum exporting economies like Norway performed well, coupled with the estimated loss of between $50 and $100 billion in provincial GDP (at the time, this was <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year's</b> GDP for the province) due to the NEP during this period, it is unquestionable that the NEP had a negative effect in Alberta.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the year-long court battle, EDO MBM suffered legal costs of between £1-£1.5 million; more than <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year's</b> profit for the Brighton arms company. Their legal team, from the firm Lawson-Cruttenden & Co, were found by the judge to have abused the legal process by delaying the full trial, and thereby held onto a temporary injunction that was in place till the full trial would decide if a permanent one was necessary.|$|R

25|$|In February 1996, custom Knifemaker Ernest Emerson and his wife, Mary, founded Emerson Knives, Inc. (also {{referred}} to as EKI) in Torrance, California to manufacture knives {{on a larger scale}} than a custom knifemaker was capable. This new company would be a distinct entity from his Specwar lineup of custom knives, although several of Emerson's custom designs have made their way into production. Four years after starting this venture, Emerson sold <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year's</b> worth of production in four hours at the SHOT (Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade) Show in January 2000.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was {{released}} during {{a run of}} lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly became the highest grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio-employed stars. This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of block-booking, in which studios would only sell <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year's</b> schedule of films {{at a time to}} theaters and use the lock-in to cover for releases of mediocre quality.|$|R
5000|$|Performance {{appraisal}} {{was set up}} in {{the first}} place, as a justification for the pay of an employee. If his performance was seen as insufficient, his pay would be cut down. However, if it was seen of a higher quality, he could receive a pay rise. Performance appraisals have been described as a [...] "flawed system", One must ask, can <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year’s</b> work be reviewed at one point in time? It has been argued that the time, money and energy needed is not comparable to its effectiveness.There are various appraisal methods.|$|R
25|$|The water {{bill has}} to be paid in full in advance for <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year,</b> which imposes a heavy burden on the poor. A {{household}} in the poorest quintile connected to the network paid an average of LBP 421,000 for water in 2008, corresponding to 3.7% of its income. More than half of these expenditures are for alternative water sources such as bottled water or water from trucks.|$|E
25|$|This has {{resulted}} in less food available for human consumption, especially in developing and least developed countries, where a family's daily allowances for food purchases are extremely limited. The crisis can be seen, in a sense, to dichotomize rich and poor nations, since, for example, filling a tank of an average car with biofuel, amounts to as much maize (Africa's principal food staple) as an African person consumes in <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the All-Star Game was pre-empted {{in favour}} of Rendez-vous '87, held at Le Colisée in Quebec City.
