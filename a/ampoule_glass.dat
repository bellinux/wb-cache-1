30|$|The {{hydrolysed}} {{amino acid}} extracts were then derivatised to N-pivaloyl isopropyl (Pv/iPr) ester derivatives for gas chromatographic (GC) analysis. The derivatisation method {{was based on}} that of Chikaraishi et al. (2010) and modified {{for the analysis of}} trace amounts of amino acids in this study. Analytical validations using a wide variety of sample profiles were performed prior to the present study (cf. Takano et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2016; Ohkouchi et al. 2017). The derivatisation procedure consists of two steps. The first step is the esterification of the carboxyl group. In this step, 100  μl of thionyl chloride/ 2 -propanol (TC/iPr, 1 / 4, v/v) was added to the tapered <b>glass</b> <b>ampoule</b> (1  ml) and heated at 110  °C for 2  h. After the ampoule was cooled to room temperature, the mixture was transferred to a new tapered <b>glass</b> <b>ampoule</b> (1  ml) by washing with two aliquots of DCM (300  μl each) and then dried under a flow of nitrogen gas. The second step of the derivatisation involves the acylation of the amino group. In this step, 200  μl of pivaloyl chloride/DCM (PC/DCM, 1 / 4, v/v) was added, and the mixture was heated at 110  °C for 2  h. In both derivatisation steps, the headspace in the <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules</b> was replaced by nitrogen gas before they were flame-sealed using a hand-held burner.|$|R

50|$|In January 1976, {{a patent}} was issued for the Chemiluminescent Signal Device, with Vincent J. Esposito, Steven M. Little, and John H. Lyons {{listed as the}} inventors (Patent 3,933,118).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{accurate}} and reliable method {{for the detection}} of wall perforation during the excimer-laser micro-drilling of <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules</b> and vials.

We show that a significant change in the signalćs amplitude is observed when the wall of a liquid-filled ampoule is perforated and the exit process point is in contact with the liquid, and that this signal change can serve as an indicator of wall perforation. We have verified this optodynamic method by examining the processed holes using optical and electron microscopy as well as with a non-destructive gas-leakage test method.
