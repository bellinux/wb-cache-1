5|$|The overall cargo {{weight is}} the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} design of an ore carrier, since the cargo is so dense. Coal carriers, on the other hand, <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> overall volume, since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{overpopulation}} and inbreeding, and {{to protect}} their habitat from being overgrazed, the horses are managed by the National Park Service, the state of North Carolina, and several private organizations. The horses are monitored for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E

25|$|Helium {{is usually}} mixed with oxygen and air {{to produce a}} range of {{effectively}} three component gas blends known as Trimixes.

5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> {{the amount of}} ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend {{the amount of time}} they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{retraction}} {{strength of}} the PAM <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the sum total strength of individual fibers in the woven shell. The exertion distance <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the tightness of the weave; a very loose weave allows greater bulging, which further twists individual fibers in the weave.|$|R
50|$|Technically, {{reformatting}} a cartridge means {{increasing its}} track density (only), as the {{linear bit density}} <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the tape coating. In the table below, a 'JA' type cartridge can be reformatted from 300 GB initially to 640 GB in the TS1130 drive. A later 'JB' type cartridge will carry 1 TB since its better coating also permits a higher linear bit density. Generally speaking, linear density <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> material, semiconductor and signal processing technologies, whereas track density <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the servo technology that prevents track runout.|$|R
25|$|The {{accuracy}} of an analog computer <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> its computing elements {{as well as}} quality of the internal power and electrical interconnections. The precision of the analog computer readout <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> chiefly <b>by</b> the precision of the readout equipment used, generally three or four significant figures. The precision of a digital computer <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the word size; arbitrary-precision arithmetic, while relatively slow, provides any practical degree of precision that might be needed.|$|R
5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata and file data. Metadata and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E

5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
