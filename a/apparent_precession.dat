40|$|We present {{observations}} of the optical "moving lines" in spectra of the Galactic relativistic jet source SS 433 spread over a twenty year baseline from 1979 to 1999. The red/blue-shifts of the lines reveal the <b>apparent</b> <b>precession</b> of the jet axis in SS 433, and we present a new determination of the precession parameters based on these data. We investigate the amplitude and nature of time- and phase-dependent deviations from the kinematic model for the jet precession, including an upper limit on any precessional period derivative of Ṗ < 5 × 10 ^- 5. We also dicuss {{the implications of these}} results for the origins of the relativistic jets in SS 433. Comment: 21 pages, including 9 figures. To appear in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effect of}} mean local node-crossing time on the evolution of Sun-synchronous orbits was undertaken during Phase-A orbit analysis for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) O,P,Q environmental spacecraft. That analysis added to the growing body of evidence that individual Sun-synchronous missions, at differing node-crossing times, experience nodal drift rates that can differ in both magnitude and direction. A Sun-synchronous orbit is obtained by means of a nodal drift rate approximating the 0. 9856 -degree-per-day <b>apparent</b> <b>precession</b> of the position of the mean Sun. This drift rate is achieved through the interaction of the orbital semimajor axis and inclination in Earth's geopotential field. Influencing perturbations include atmospheric drag and, most important, the effects of solar gravitation on inclination. The present analysis examines a series of Sun-synchronous orbits with mean local node-crossing times at 1 -hour intervals from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. It considers the fixed geometry of each orbital plane with respect to both the Sun and the diurnal atmospheric bulge, then analyzes the influence of these features upon the evolution of the semimajor axix and inclination and thus upon the rate of the nodal drift in the course of 1 year...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{determination}} of micromagnetic parameters of epilayers of the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn) As, which has an easy axis in the sample plane, and (Ga,Mn) (As,P), which has an easy axis perpendicular to the sample plane. We use an optical analog of ferromagnetic resonancewhere the laser-pulse-induced precession of magnetization is measured directly in the time domain. By the analysis of a single set of pump-and-probe magneto-optical data, we determined the magnetic anisotropy fields, the spin stiffness, and the Gilbert damping constant in these two materials. We show that incorporation of 10 % of phosphorus in (Ga,Mn) As with 6 % of manganese leads {{not only to the}} expected sign change of the perpendicular-to-plane anisotropy field but also to an increase of the Gilbert damping and to a reduction of the spin stiffness. The observed changes in the micromagnetic parameters upon incorporating P in (Ga,Mn) As are consistent with the reduced hole density, conductivity, and Curie temperature of the (Ga,Mn) (As,P) material. We also show that the <b>apparent</b> magnetization <b>precession</b> damping is stronger for the n= 1 spinwave resonance mode than for the n= 0 uniform magnetization precession mode...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out multi-epoch VLBI {{observations}} with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry) of the 22 GHz H_ 2 O masers {{associated with a}} Class 0 protostar L 1448 C in the Perseus molecular cloud. The maser features trace the base of collimated bipolar jet driven {{by one of the}} infrared counter parts of L 1448 C named as L 1448 C(N) or L 1448 -mm A. We detected possible evidences for <b>apparent</b> acceleration and <b>precession</b> of the jet according to the three-dimensional velocity structure. Based on the phase-referencing VLBI astrometry, we have successfully detected an annual parallax of the H_ 2 O maser in L 1448 C to be 4. 31 ± 0. 33 milliarcseconds (mas) which corresponds to a distance of 232 ± 18 pc from the Sun. The present result is in good agreement with that of another H_ 2 O maser source NGC 1333 SVS 13 A in the Perseus molecular cloud, 235 pc. It is also consistent with the photometric distance, 220 pc. Thus, the distance to {{the western part of the}} Perseus molecular cloud complex would be constrained to be about 235 pc rather than the larger value, 300 pc, previously reported.

40|$|The Cassini spacecraft, which entered {{orbit around}} Saturn in 2004, has {{provided}} a wealth of observations at resolutions and geometries unavailable from Earth, thereby expanding {{our knowledge of the}} Saturnian system. In this work, I study both Saturn's extensive ring system and one of its moons, Hyperion. Previous Voyager and ground-based work had shown that Hyperion, unlike nearly all inner satellites of the giant planets, rotates asynchronously and about a non-principal axis, as a result of strongly-varying tides from Saturn. Modeling done by Wisdom et al. (1984) showed that Hyperion's rotation was also changing in a chaotic fashion over timescales of several months, making it difficult to predict the moon's past and future orientation from only the Voyager flyby. However, in 2005, Cassini performed three close flybys of Hyperion within the Lyapunov timescale. Not only did this let me construct a model of Hyperion's spin state covering much of 2005, it offered clues to Hyperion's interior structure. Because the effect of Saturn's tidal torques on Hyperion's spin depend on Hyperion's internal structure, I could rule out some internal structures if they could not reproduce the changes in spin state in 2005. In particular, a uniformdensity model produces a poor fit to observations, as do models in which the principal axes of rotation align with those expected from Hyperion's shape. Hyperion's lack of <b>apparent</b> in-body <b>precession</b> in 2005 suggests either an unlikely coincidence or that an actual principal axis of rotation is closely aligned with the spin axis. With regard to studies of Saturn's rings, Cassini's orbit about Saturn not only permits many more stellar occultations of the rings to be observed than can be seen from Earth, but allow for solar occultations of the rings, a geometry impossible to achieve from Earth. Both the actual resolution of the VisibleInfrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument and the resolution gained from translating the star's apparent motion behind the rings into angular resolution permit the diffraction of sunlight or starlight by ring particles to be observed, thus giving information about the size distribution of ring particles in certain areas of the rings. In this work, I measure both the minimum particle size of the A and C Rings, as well as the outermost edge of the B Ring, and the slopes of regions in the outer A Ring, C Ring, Cassini Division and outer B Ring. I find that the C Ring contains particles down to 4. 1 + 3. 1 mm in radius, with a [-] 1. 3 particle-size distribution that can be modeled as a power law with a differential power-law index of ~ 3. 0. The outer edge of the B Ring likewise contains particles down to a radius of several millimeters, and has a relatively steep powerlaw index of ~ 3. 4, making it quite different from other studies of other areas of this ring (but rather like {{the outer edge of the}} A Ring). I was also able to confirm a shallow ~ 2. 8 power-law index for the ring particles in the Cassini Division. For the A Ring, I report only an upper limit on the minimum particle size of 0. 6 mm for the inner and mid-A Ring, and a minimum particle size of 3 - 7 mm in radius in the outer parts of the A Ring. I confirm the power-law index of 2. 9 to 3. 0 in the outer A Ring, and discover that in the very outermost portions of the ring, the trans-Keeler region, the power-law index steepens to ~ 3. 4 or even steeper. I also discovered that the effect of the A Ring's self gravity wakes - temporary aggregates of ring particles in to 50 - 100 m structures - makes a noticeable difference in any attempt to model the ring's particle-size distribution in the inner and mid A Ring, but that wakes appear to play little role near the edges of the two gaps in the A Ring, and at the A Ring's outer edge. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
