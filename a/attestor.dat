[...] 570 [...] Wits, warriors, commonwealth's-men, were the best: [...] Kind husbands, and mere nobles, all the rest. [...] And therefore, {{in the name of}} dulness, be [...] The well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free: [...] And canting Nadab let {{oblivion}} damn, [...] Who made new porridge for the paschal lamb. [...] Let friendship's holy band some names assure; [...] Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure. [...] Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place, [...] Whom kings no titles gave, and God no grace: [...] 580 [...] Not bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes draw [...] To mean rebellion, and make treason law. [...] But he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse, [...] The wretch who Heaven's anointed dared to curse; [...] Shimei, whose youth did early promise bring [...] Of zeal to God and hatred to his king, [...] Did wisely from expensive sins refrain, [...] And never broke the Sabbath but for gain; [...] Nor ever was he known an oath to vent, [...] Or curse, unless against the government. [...] 590 [...] Thus heaping wealth by the most ready way [...] Among the Jews, which was to cheat and pray; [...] The city, to reward his pious hate [...] Against his master, chose him magistrate. [...] His hand a vare[70] of justice did uphold; [...] His neck was loaded with a chain of gold. [...] During his office treason was no crime; [...] The sons of Belial had a glorious time: [...] For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf, [...] Yet loved his wicked neighbour as himself. [...] 600 [...] When two or three were gather'd to declaim [...] Against the monarch of Jerusalem, [...] Shimei was always in the midst of them; [...] And if they cursed the king when he was by, [...] Would rather curse than break good company. [...] If any durst his factious friends accuse, [...] He pack'd a jury of dissenting Jews; [...] Whose fellow-feeling in the godly cause [...] Would free the suffering saint from human laws. [...] For laws are only made to punish those [...] 610 [...] Who serve the king, and to protect his foes. [...] If any leisure time he had from power [...] (Because 'tis sin to misemploy an hour), [...] His business was, by writing to persuade, [...] That kings were useless and a clog to trade; [...] And, that his noble style he might refine, [...] No Rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wind. [...] Chaste were his cellars, and his shrivel board [...] The grossness of a city feast abhorr'd; [...] His cooks with long disuse their trade forgot; [...] 620 [...] Cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot. [...] Such frugal virtue malice may accuse, [...] But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews; [...] For towns, once burnt, such magistrates require [...] As dare not tempt God's providence by fire. [...] With spiritual food he fed his servants well, [...] But free from flesh that made the Jews rebel: [...] And Moses' laws he held in more account, [...] For forty days of fasting in the mount. [...] To speak the rest who better are forgot, [...] 630 [...] Would tire a well-breathed witness of the plot. [...] Yet Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass; [...] Erect thyself, thou monumental brass, [...] High as the serpent of thy metal made, [...] While nations stand secure beneath thy shade. [...] What though his birth were base, yet comets rise [...] From earthly vapours, ere they shine in skies. [...] Prodigious actions may as well be done [...] By weaver's issue, as by prince's son. [...] This arch <b>attestor</b> for the public good [...] 640 [...] By that one deed ennobles all his blood. [...] Who ever ask'd the witness's high race, [...] Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace? [...] Ours was a Levite, and as times went then, [...] His tribe were God Almighty's gentlemen. [...] Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud, [...] Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud. [...] His long chin proved his wit; his saint-like grace [...] A church vermilion, and a Moses' face. [...] His memory miraculously great, [...] 650 [...] Could plots, exceeding man's belief, repeat; [...] Which therefore cannot be accounted lies, [...] For human wit could never such devise. [...] Some future truths are mingled in his book; [...] But where the witness fail'd, the prophet spoke. [...] Some things like visionary flights appear; [...] The spirit caught him up the Lord knows where; [...] And gave him his rabbinical degree, [...] Unknown to foreign university. [...] His judgment yet his memory did excel; [...] 660 [...] Which pieced his wondrous evidence so well, [...] And suited to the temper of the times, [...] Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes. [...] Let Israel's foes suspect his heavenly call, [...] And rashly judge his wit apocryphal; [...] Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made; [...] He takes his life who takes away his trade. [...] Were I myself in witness Corah's place, [...] The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace, [...] Should whet my memory, though once forgot, [...] 670 [...] To make him an appendix of my plot. [...] His zeal to heaven made him his prince despise, [...] And load his person with indignities. [...] But zeal peculiar privilege affords, [...] Indulging latitude to deeds and words: [...] And Corah might for Agag's murder call, [...] In terms as coarse as Samuel used to Saul. [...] What others in his evidence did join, [...] The best that could be had for love or coin, [...] In Corah's own predicament will fall: [...] 680 [...] For witness is a common name to all.|$|E

Social reporting is needed because society has certain right to information. Companies must perform social activities and also report such activities, so that society can judge their overall performance. This study seeks to find out the significance of social responsibility information as perceived by preparers, <b>attestors</b> and users of such information. The result of the study shows that out of the overall six areas of social concern environmental contribution has been ranked first followed by energy conservation and human resources.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{attestation}} mechanism that enables a remote verifier to implicitly evaluate the trustworthiness of the prover’s system through policies. Those policies are verified and enforced by a TPM 2. 0, when the <b>attestor</b> interacts with a virtualized hardware {{component of the}} prover’s system. For instance, when the verifier reads a virtualized sensor device and requests integrity-protected sensor data, such as the average temperature, a heartbeat value, or an anomaly detection score, the prover’s TPM, which acts as a trust anchor, checks and enforces the policies specified by the verifier. The prover, in turn, is also able to define policies, which can limit access to certain hardware components and are also enforced by the TPM. As a result, both parties have to cooperate for a successful attestation, which implicitly creates verifiable proof of the prover’s trustworthiness using mainly symmetric instead of expensive asymmetric cryptographic operations like digital signatures...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to produce a}} biographical study of King Stephen's wife, similar in scope and type to Marjorie Chibnall's 1991 work The Empress Matilda. The introduction will examine the primary sources for Matilda of Boulogne's career - chronicles written during and after her lifetime and charters she issued or attested - and point out their problems; examine her career as discussed in secondary sources; and examine her early life, including an attempt to put her children in birth order. A lack of primary source material prevents any longer examination of her career before Stephen's 1135 accession. The first chapter is a narrative of the queen's career, collating documentary and chronicle sources to provide the background for later, in-depth discussion. Where possible and appropriate, this chapter also {{attempts to}} date charters more precisely. The second chapter discusses Matilda's religious life, and has three parts. The first and longest is an in-depth analysis of her charters to religious houses, to determine her patterns of patronage and personal preferences. The second compares her religious charters to Stephen's and examines the connections between them using the queen's attestations; this determines whether the queen's grants were self-directed or motivated by her husband. The final section examines Matilda of Boulogne's relationships with various religious figures, and in particular tries to date her various interactions with Bernard of Clairvaux. The third chapter analyses the witness-lists of Matilda's charters {{in order to determine}} with whom she was in closest contact - the make-up of her curia, in other words - and provides some discussion of her most frequent <b>attestors.</b> There is also a comparison between Stephen and Matilda's most frequent <b>attestors,</b> which determines that Matilda, rather than being an alternative nexus of prestige or having a parallel curia, was a member of Stephen's inner circle who had a small personal household. The fourth chapter is an examination of Matilda of Boulogne's authority - its sources, types, and uses. In general, Matilda's authority was highly nuanced, came from multiple sources, including her roles as wife, mother, countess, and queen, and allowed her to take highly effective, flexible action whenever Stephen's interests or hers were threatened. The final chapter places the queen's career in context by examining the careers of four of her relatives, and comparing them to Matilda's; it becomes apparent from this analysis that Matilda actively modelled herself on her predecessors, particularly those who were queens. </p...|$|R
500|$|Æthelflæd {{was born}} around 870, the oldest child of King Alfred the Great and his Mercian wife, Ealhswith, {{who was a}} {{daughter}} of Æthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, one of the tribes of Mercia. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, {{was a member of}} the Mercian royal house, probably a descendant of King Coenwulf (796–821). Æthelflæd was thus half-Mercian and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was sealed by her marriage to Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are mentioned in Alfred's will, which probably dates to the 880s. Æthelflæd, described only as [...] "my eldest daughter", received an estate and 100 mancuses, while Æthelred, the only ealdorman to be mentioned by name, received a sword worth 100 mancuses. Æthelflæd was first recorded as Æthelred's wife in a charter of 887, when he granted two estates to the see of Worcester [...] "with the permission and sign-manual of King Alfred" [...] and the <b>attestors</b> included [...] "Æthelflæd conjux". The marriage may have taken place earlier, perhaps when he submitted to Alfred following the recovery of London in 886. Æthelred was much older than Æthelflæd and they had one known child, a daughter called Ælfwynn. Æthelstan, the eldest son of Edward the Elder and future king of England, was brought up in their court and, in the view of Martin Ryan, certainly joined their campaigns against the Vikings.|$|R
40|$|The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has {{now been}} in {{existence}} {{for a little more}} than twenty-two years (1973 -present), and although it has received its share of criticism, {{there is no indication that}} the FASB will soon be displaced. One of the strongest reasons for its relatively successful continuance is probably the open due process followed wherein the FASB formally seeks and responds to views of financial statement preparers, users, and <b>attestors.</b> This study examines and describes specific views stated by four professional organizations on eleven highly controversial accounting standards issued since the FASB’s inception. These organizations, which have been shown to be relatively influential and very active in the standard-setting process, include the Financial Analysts Federation (FAF), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Financial Executives Institute (FEI), and National Organization of Accountants (NAA). An overview of the positions taken by the FASB and each of the four organizations shows that the FASB aligned most closely with FAF on the first five standards examined. This tendency, however, is not evident on the following nine standards. As anticipated, FEI and NAA tend to take similar positions which conflict with FAF; the AICPA is not consistently aligned with FAF or FEI/NAA. Most importantly, the findings also suggests an underlying cohesiveness in the FASB’s accounting standards that persists regardless of positions taken by the four organizations. 1 AN EXAMINATION OF COMMENT LETTERS FILED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDAR...|$|R
40|$|For {{transverse}} impedance and pick-up measurements {{an image}} plane {{with an array}} of interleaved small probes and loops fed by delay lines was built. This set-up has been used to simulate the field of a slow particle beam with a beta of 0. 065. By varying the delay line length and the probe-and loop-power dividers, the beta value and the ratio of the transverse E and H-fields can be adjusted independently. We discuss the simulated and actual beam fields and present first results of bench measurements.

40|$|The {{dual purpose}} of this article is to {{elucidate}} the management system of sharia court (Islamic law court) and the social relation of the inhabitants of the Sālihīya Quarter around it by examining four volumes of the Sālihīya sharia court registers during the period of 1290 - 1295 / 1873 - 78. The main arguments are as follows: 1. The registers and documents were recorded according to the Islamic legal manuals (shurūt) and also the Ottoman court regulations in order to register the civil rights of the people when contracting transaction and conducting lawsuits, and in matters of inheritance. The registers were strictly controlled by the authority to prevent abuse by alteration of the documents. Furthermore, fictional lawsuits were carried out and recorded to prevent the future objection of the parties. Such strict formality of court management and registration made the work load of the court-officials too heavy, which led to disorderly management and corruption, which was contrary to its purpose. 2. The inhabitants, whether rich or poor, including females and nonadults would attend the Sālihīya court to register their rights there. To authorize the validity of the contract and to register it required the testimony of witnesses and the confirmation of other attendants such as acquaintants, <b>attestors</b> etc., as requested by the principles of Islamic law. We can find some members who attended the court to witness and attest regularly. They were composed of the local notables of the Quarter and advisers of legal affairs. The people needed to keep in contact with such persons who certified their rights, and the court operated by such personal networks of the parties, agents, witnesses, and other dignitaries. 3. The judges, scribes, and other court-officials played the role of observing the process and authorizing it. For procedural questions, the judges were prohibited from enforcing their own decisions, rather they had to supervise a process in which both of the parties tried to reach an agreement by showing the evidence, calling witnesses or by taking oaths, according to the rule of Islamic law in the presence of the above-mentioned court attendants. 4. These three points show that the rule of Islamic law was kept and operated by both the common people and the legal experts at the end of the 19 th century when the Islamic legal system had begun to reform during the Tanzimat Reformation period...|$|R
