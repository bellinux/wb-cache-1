5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Brazilian {{football}} clubs, Atlético Mineiro's by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (sócios). The club's administrative powers are the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics <b>and</b> <b>Discipline</b> Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council among its members every three years, which in turn elects and removes the club's Board, responsible for the executive management of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the Galo na Veia affiliation programme, called sócios-torcedores, are not full club associates and cannot vote or be elected.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} transferred {{control of}} the Boston police department from Boston's mayor to the governor of Massachusetts, whom it authorized to appoint a five-person board of commissioners to manage the department. In 1906, the legislature abolished that board and gave the governor the authority to name a single commissioner to a term of five years, subject to removal by the governor. The mayor and the city continued to have responsibility for the department's expenses and the physical working conditions of its employees, but the commissioner controlled department operations and the hiring, training, <b>and</b> <b>discipline</b> of the police officers.|$|E

5|$|Long {{before the}} Royal Military College of Canada was {{established}} in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3 month long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill <b>and</b> <b>discipline,</b> to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer. The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.|$|E

Each of Weber's principles can degenerateand more so, when {{they are used to}} analyze the individual level in an organization. But, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules <b>and</b> <b>discipline.</b>|$|E

This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes {{and the fact that he}} was assessed only one major penalty throughout his NHL career.|$|E

5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship <b>and</b> <b>discipline</b> on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E

Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience <b>and</b> <b>discipline.</b> Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.|$|E
5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing {{the envy of the}} other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of the}} Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when all he wanted was to organize <b>and</b> <b>discipline</b> the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E

5|$|After a long minority, the {{personal}} reign of James V saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for the infant Mary Queen of Scots. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, {{which ended in}} the Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The Scottish Reformation was strongly influenced by Calvinism leading to widespread iconoclasm {{and the introduction of}} a Presbyterian system of organisation <b>and</b> <b>discipline</b> that would {{have a major impact on}} Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power in the name of the infant James VI. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training <b>and</b> <b>discipline.</b> The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
5|$|By July 1941, Morshead {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating and, {{in spite of}} his efforts, their morale <b>and</b> <b>discipline</b> were slipping. He informed Generals Blamey and Auchinleck that they should be relieved. Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to be relieved by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations came into play. The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey's advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. As it turned out, the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.|$|E
