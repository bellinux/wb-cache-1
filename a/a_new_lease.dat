5|$|The canal {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} the state in 1886. This briefly gave it <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life, but the canal had an obsolete gauge. By {{the start of the}} 20th century it was almost abandoned. The canal was neglected and parts were filled in. In the 1970s the A47 autoroute between Givors and Saint-Étienne covered almost all the sections that remained, apart from the site at Tartaras where the double lock and tunnel have been preserved as a heritage site.|$|E
5|$|The {{next season}} {{started with the}} death of goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan and the {{departure}} of Primus' close friend Moore to West Bromwich Albion. Primus struggled to get a game under Rix but the appointment of Harry Redknapp in March 2002 gave him <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life and he ended that season with two league goals in games against Bradford City and Barnsley.|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
40|$|Background and Problem Discussion: Due to {{companies}} large off-balance sheet obligations, {{discussions of the}} current standard regarding leasing, IAS 17, have provided suggestions to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> standard, which is the foundation for this thesis. Purpose and Research Question: The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine if the implementation of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> standard could have an effect on the market value of firms. The research question is: Do investors find the replacement of IAS 17 value relevant? If so, is the value relevance more prominent in certain industries or related to the size of the company? Methodology: In order to fulfil the purpose, an Event Study is performed. Data collection is primarily performed through DataStream and analysis of the data is performed in Stata. Results and Conclusion: The empirical findings in this study suggest no general effect on value relevance regarding the new standard. No significant results are found within different industries. However, considering companies of different size, significant results are found. The general conclusion is therefore that size is probably a variable that is value relevant to investors considering the replacement of the <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> standard...|$|R

5|$|In {{this era}} Scotland {{followed}} {{the trend of}} Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V, {{as well as being}} a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.|$|E
5|$|She starred {{alongside}} Natalie Deselle Reid in the 1997 comedy film B*A*P*S. In 1998, Berry received {{praise for}} her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician (Warren Beatty) <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> on life. The same year, she played the singer Zola Taylor, one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon, in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love. In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, she portrayed {{the first black woman to}} be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and it was to Berry a heart-felt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for it to come through. Berry's performance was recognized with several awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s saw the {{construction}} of the Employment Exchange and the planning of the new Council House, although this was not completed until 1956. As a centre of aircraft manufacturing, Bristol was a target for bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. Bristol's city centre was severely damaged, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city. The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park featuring two bombed-out churches and fragments of the castle. A third bombed church has been given <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life as the St Nicholas' Church Museum. Slightly to the north, the Broadmead shopping centre was built over bomb-damaged areas. Clifton Cathedral, {{to the north of the}} city centre, was built during the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Richard Bowker CBE (born 1966) is {{a former}} chief {{executive}} of National Express Group and former {{chairman and chief executive of}} the Strategic Rail Authority. He attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Blackburn, read economics at Leicester University, and played as a professional session pianist for a year. In 1989 he joined the London Underground as a graduate finance trainee; in the course of this work, he was credited with the launch of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>leasing</b> system for trains in 1997.|$|R

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life, during {{a period in which}} many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay for it all directly. The porter's lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} James V's {{daughter}} Mary from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her {{position as a}} Catholic, gave <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. James VI was a major patron {{of the arts in}} general. He made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, attempting to revive burgh song schools from 1579. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. Beginning to fall into disrepair, the Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, leaving the court in Westminster as the only major source of royal musical patronage.|$|E

25|$|By a Charter of Elizabeth I in 1589 {{the bailiff}} was {{replaced}} by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the Georgian era, patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby Brighton) gave it <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a County Borough, responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, in 1974, that status was abolished.|$|E

25|$|One {{component}} of the restructuring was negotiating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>lease</b> agreement with the Kentucky State Fair Board, which owned much {{of the land and}} attractions for Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom.

Finally, H.R. 2231 would direct DOI to collect fees from certain firms that operate in the OCS and to implement various administrative reforms.|$|R
