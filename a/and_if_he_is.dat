Shepherd told Alison Gardner from What's on TV that David thinks if he confronts Kylie their relationship will end. He has to decide who should be punished for the affair. He decides that Nick is to blame <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to get revenge on him then Kylie must remain oblivious. He then contemplates committing suicide and then vandalises Nick's flat. The actor concluded that David could forgive Kylie for her infidelity.|$|E
5|$|The Engineers try to flee Site F, using Briggs and {{the hostages}} as human shields. Fisher, {{disguised}} as an Air Force hostage, helps Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men. Sadiq escapes on foot, and Fisher disarms and seriously wounds him. Sadiq boasts {{that he has}} already won; if he dies twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> tried, he will leak U.S. information. Although Fisher spares Sadiq, he detains him. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations; in a post-credits scene, a recovered Coste and Fisher prepare to interrogate Sadiq.|$|E

5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E

25|$|I must own, I cannot {{conceive}} what {{ideas of}} art and dramatic connexion those persons have who suppose that we can at pleasure tack a double conclusion to a tragedy; a melancholy one for hard-hearted spectators, and a happy one for souls of a softer mould.

25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female marsh harrier courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> always alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E
500|$|In {{a moment}} {{described}} as [...] "(in)famous" [...] by Cross, on Nar Shaddaa the player may give a beggar money or leave him; {{if he is}} given the money, Kreia shows how he is made a target of and attacked, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> refused Kreia reveals he attacks others. Owen called this moment the crystallization of the game's gray areas. Anthony Brock of Gamers Hell noted how it led to him passionately arguing with a game character, complimenting Obsidian for how involved he felt. Cobbett similarly highlighted the moment when praising the character. Buecheler, however, criticized the scene for using an unlikely chance event to make its point.|$|E

Kalākaua's {{letter to his}} sister Liliuokalani expressed his excitement about meeting the Queen, [...] "…I was quite electrified and monopolized the whole conversation that {{took place during the}} interview." [...] His letter was effusive in details about the titled royals and aristocrats they had met, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Prussia. The Prince of Wales paid many attentions to Kalākaua, hoping to sway him away from the United States. He insisted on giving [...] Kalākaua precedence ahead of his brother-in-law, the Crown Prince of Germany and responded to German objections by saying, 'Either the brute is a king or else he is an ordinary black nigger, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a king, why is he here?'

John then downloads himself into Planet B and enters a section called [...] "Golden Moments" [...] which allows him to play the best moments of his life, but a technical fault results in him being forced to constantly watch Lioba's funeral. John, along with his virtual hostess and guide Medley, discover that the problem revolves around Lioba. John then begins to see memories that are not his but Lioba's. He therefore begins to believe that Lioba is still alive somewhere in Planet B. John and Medley decide to search Planet B in an attempt to find her by jumping into a rift in the system, taking part in the various games and worlds in the system as they go along. However, when they exit the rift, John is no longer his avatar, but himself with his DNA digitised. As a result, he feels everything in Planet B for real, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> killed in a game, he will really die.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt's {{treatment}} of The Merchant of Venice centres {{on the character}} of Shylock. A few years earlier, Edmund Kean had appeared as the Jewish moneylender in his debut performance at Drury Lane. Hazlitt, the drama critic for the Morning Chronicle in January 1814, sat close to the stage and watched every facial expression, every movement. He was astounded at Kean's, for the time, radically unconventional portrayal of Shylock as a full, rounded, complex human being, full of vigour, rather than a doddering, malevolent stereotype. His positive review of Kean's performance became critical in boosting the actor's career. But Kean's performance also helped alter Hazlitt's own view of Shylock, which made its way into this essay a few years later. Hazlitt admitted that he had tended to accept the older interpretation of Shylock's character as it had been depicted on stage, which followed centuries-old prejudices against the Jews, and made him a one-dimensional character. Kean's performance led him to study the play closely and think deeply about Shylock. Though Shylock's [...] "mind is warped with prejudices and passion [...] that he has but one idea, is not true; he has more ideas than any other person in the piece; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> intense and inveterate in the pursuit of his purpose, he shews the utmost elasticity, vigour, and presence of mind, in the means of attaining it".|$|E
