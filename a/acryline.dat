30|$|Simple square boxes {{made from}} <b>Acryline</b> {{at the size}} of 12  cm ×  12  cm were used as {{horizontal}} PBRs in this experiment, which were placed on a see-saw rocker to provide mixing. To investigate different mixing intensities, the see-saw rocker was controlled to finish one up/down rocking cycle every 1  s or every 2  s. Culture depth of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10  cm were investigated with this system. To prevent evaporation, the reactor was sealed with transparent membrane on the top, with two holes left to release oxygen. LED panel with 70 % red and 30 % blue light was placed above the PBRs. Light intensities investigated were 70, 135, and 340  μmol/m 2 /s, which were measured at the surface of culture medium. The whole culture system was placed in an incubator, which was controlled at 35  °C (Chi et al. 2013).|$|E
