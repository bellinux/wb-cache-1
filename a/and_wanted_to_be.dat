5|$|Born on 24 June 1982 in Liverpool, Merseyside, Nolan {{was brought}} up by a football-playing family in Toxteth, <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a footballer from a young age. He {{attended}} Liverpool Blue Coat School and {{by the age of}} 14, he was playing for the City of Liverpool's schoolboys team. As a child, he supported Celtic and Liverpool, although conversely, his favourite players were Eric Cantona and Lee Sharpe of Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|By October 1906, Charles Parham {{was invited}} to speak {{for a series of}} {{meetings}} at Azusa Street but was quickly un-invited. Parham had personality conflicts with Seymour <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the chief authority figure of the movement that was taking place, but the presiding leaders of the Apostolic Faith Mission were slow to make any changes to their methods or leadership.|$|E
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a spokesperson for women.|$|E

25|$|An origin myth relates that an icon from {{a chapel}} dug {{into a nearby}} cliff, {{repeatedly}} vanished without any observable cause, to be found on a volcanic hill, {{the site of the}} current chapel. The faithful took this as a sign that the icon did not want to remain in the underground chapel, <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed in a free-standing church.|$|E

25|$|When war {{appeared}} inevitable {{he resigned}} his Royal commission and volunteered his {{services to the}} colonies. He expected to be named Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, as {{he was the most}} experienced candidate in terms of military service. On the other hand, he was born in Britain, somewhat eccentric, slovenly in appearance, coarse in language, and perhaps most of all, he wanted to be paid: by joining the rebellion, he forfeited all his properties in England, <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compensated.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Franck, who was {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} feminist, was uncomfortable being {{in the shadow of}} her famous husband <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recognized for her own work. In 1970, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London planned to stage Franck's first solo exhibition: when she saw that the invitations included her husband's name and said he would be present at the launch, she cancelled the show. Franck once said that she put her husband's career ahead of her own. In 2003 Franck and her daughter launched the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation to promote Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, and in 2004 Franck became its president.|$|E
25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that {{we were in a}} great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the second}} span was {{temporarily}} interrupted in July 1940 when 250 workers at Smoot Sand & Gravel walked out to protest a job classification by the federal Wage and Hour Division. The men worked on barges dredging gravel, <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> classified as seamen so they could qualify for overtime and work more than the federally approved 42-hour work week. The strike began on July 9, lasted five days, and idled more than 6,500 workers (including those working on the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings) as no concrete could be delivered. The men won reclassification as seamen, a 10 percent wage increase, and pay for five days they were idle.|$|E
25|$|From Italy Fregoli went to Brazil, Spain, and the United States. While {{he was in}} Madrid he was {{watched in}} {{performance}} by Alfred Moul, {{the general manager of}} the Alhambra Theatre in London's Charing Cross Road (which was being refitted at that time in the Moorish style {{under the direction of the}} great designer Owen Jones). Moul had heard of Fregoli's genius <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first impresario in Britain to sign him up. He subsequently claimed that Fregoli (and his team of supporting assistants) were being paid £350 per week to perform at the Alhambra—a remarkable amount for the time. This was nothing compared to what Fregoli was to generate in ticket sales.|$|E
25|$|Loerzer was out {{of contact}} with Reichenau's command post for three days, while Richthofen was soon {{complaining}} to Löhr about the former's ignorance. Because he was impetuous <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in the thick of}} the action, Richthofen began flying around over the frontline in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, as air-ground liaison collapsed. His claims were not always believed, and these personal operations were a waste of time and needlessly exposed him to danger. Indeed, Major Spielvogel was shot down over Warsaw in his Storch on 9 September, and killed. While the operational situation was not good, Löhr took command of Fliegerführer z.b.V., giving the unit virtual autonomy and allowing Richthofen to build a personal empire of six Gruppen (Groups).|$|E

25|$|Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially {{known as}} Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This {{dates back to}} 1682, when the StMichael's church tower collapsed. The {{authorities}} were strapped for cash and saw {{no option but to}} sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the copper.|$|E
25|$|Castellano's {{most vocal}} critic was John Gotti, a Queens-based capo and Dellacroce protégé. Gotti was ambitious <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> boss himself. He was also angry that Castellano allowed the DeMeo crew to deal in {{narcotics}} while forbidding {{him from doing}} it. Gotti and his men conducted their drug trade in secret. The 1983 Ruggiero indictment came from phone conversations that Federal agents had recorded on Gotti's phone. The taped conversations included Ruggiero discussing drug deals and expressing his contempt for Castellano. By law, the defendants were allowed transcripts of these wiretap conversations to aid their defense. Castellano immediately demanded copies for himself. Dellacroce kept the transcripts from Castellano – the drug dealing and disrespectful language on the transcripts would have given Castellano cause to kill both Ruggiero and John Gotti. In turn, Dellacroce prevented Gotti from deposing Castellano, citing his promise to Carlo Gambino.|$|E
25|$|The result meant Buemi {{extended}} his lead over di Grassi in the Drivers' Championship to 43 points ahead, with Prost maintaining third place on 58 points. Heidfeld's strong finish {{enabled him to}} move into fourth place with 47 points and Vergne's retirement meant he fell to fifth on 40 points. e.Dams-Renault's strong performance allowed them to consolidate their lead in the Teams' Championship with 190 points; although neither of their cars scored points, Audi Sport ABT were still second while Mahindra's strong results meant they strengthened their hold on third place. With Techeetah not scoring points, Virgin and NextEV moved into fourth and fifth respectively with six races left in the season. Despite the setbacks for Audi Sport ABT, the team's principal Hans-Jürgen Abt hoped the German company had used up all the bad luck <b>and</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back in contention for the season's next two races.|$|E
