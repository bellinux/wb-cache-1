25|$|Other {{prescription}} drugs are also used, if other methods are not effective.

Evidence continues to indicate that MAOIs are effective in the treatment and management of social anxiety disorder <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> used, but generally {{only as a last resort}} medication, owing to concerns about dietary restrictions, possible adverse drug interactions and a recommendation of multiple doses per day. A newer type of this medication, Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase subtype A (RIMAs) such as the drug moclobemide, bind reversibly to the MAO-A enzyme, greatly reducing the risk of hypertensive crisis with dietary tyramine intake.|$|E
