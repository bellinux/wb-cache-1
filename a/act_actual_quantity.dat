50|$|None {{of these}} effects in itself predicts {{what will happen}} to <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of goods demanded (the number of units purchased) as prices change—they refer only to {{preferences}} or propensities to purchase. The <b>actual</b> effect on <b>quantity</b> demanded will depend on the range of other goods available, their prices, and their substitutabilities for the goods concerned. The effects are anomalies within demand theory because the theory normally assumes that preferences are independent of price or the number of units being sold. They are therefore collectively referred to as interaction effects.|$|R

50|$|In {{variance}} analysis, {{direct material}} usage (efficiency, quantity) variance {{is the difference}} between the standard quantity of materials that should have been used for the number of units actually produced, and the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of materials used, valued at the standard cost per unit of material. It is one of the two components (the other is direct material price variance) of direct material total variance.|$|R
50|$|Sales Price Variance: The {{sales price}} {{variance}} reveals {{the difference in}} total revenue caused by charging a different selling price from the planned or standard price. The sales price variance is calculated as: <b>Actual</b> <b>quantity</b> sold * (<b>actual</b> selling price - planned selling price). In the example, the sales price variance was 6*($2-$3)= -$6 (U)nfavourable or minus $6, since the sales price was less than planned.|$|R
40|$|A common {{approach}} for procuring large construction projects is through Unit Price Contracts. By {{the means of}} a simple model, we study the optimal quantity to procure under uncertainty regarding the <b>actual</b> required <b>quantity</b> given that the procurer strives to minimize expected total costs. The model shows that the quantity to procure in optimum follows from a trade-off between {{the risk of having}} to pay for more units than actually necessary and of having to conduct costly renegotiations. The optimal quantity increases in costs associated with possible renegotiations, decreases in expected per unit price, and, if a renegotiation does not increase per unit price too much, decreases in the uncertainty surrounding the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> required.

40|$|Hemolysin in {{antisera}} is customarily {{estimated by}} "titer " and this measurement has served its {{purpose in the}} evaluation of antisera and in the determination of the relative degree of sensitization of erythrocytes. However, knowledge of the mode of action of hemolysins on red cells and of the quantitative relations of hemolysins to erythrocytes and complement has been difficult of access {{not only because of the}} complicated and sensitive nature of the reactions and their components, but also because methods of assay yielding end "fiters " are, taken alone, without significance as to the actual weights of the reactants. Moreover, these methods do not even give relative values when different substances or functions are measured by end "titers, " since the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of one substance required to produce its characteristic effect may greatly exceed that of another substance producing the same or a different effect. End "titers " are often, therefore, in opposite ratio to the <b>actual</b> <b>quantities</b> involved.

Invented by Professor Maximilian Ringelmann in Paris in 1888, it is {{essentially}} a card with squares of black, white and shades of gray which is held up and the comparative grayness of the smoke judged. Highly dependent on light conditions and the skill of the observer it allocates a grayness number from 0 (white) to 5 (black) which has only a passing relationship to the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of smoke. Nonetheless, {{the simplicity of the}} Ringelmann scale means that it has been adopted as a standard in many countries.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{assessment}} of private damages that the cartelization of a market imposes on buyers in that market and, possibly, on the buyers' own customers in further market downstream. Abstracting from procedural problems and focussing on conceptual issues, the paper argues that damages comprise not just the overcharge on the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> purchased, but also foregone profits on the units that are not purchased because the cartel price {{is higher than the}} competitive price. The paper also argues that the passing-on defense against claims by direct buyers is flawed because it neglects the business loss effect that is associated with a direct buyer's raising his own price to pass the higher cartel price on to his own customers. If direct buyers are not in competition with each other, a revealed-preference argument shows that the business loss effect on the direct buyer's profits is necessarily greater than the effect of the increase in revenues per unit that is sold. The overcharge on the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> purchased again is a lower bound for actual damages. The assessment of damages suffered by indirect buyers is independent of this refutation of the passing-on defense. If direct buyers are in competition with each other, there is an additional business gain effect because the cartelization upstream raises rivals' costs and thereby affects the competition between the direct buyers. In this case, {{the assessment of}} damages depends on the treatment of causation i. e., to what extent a direct buyer's competitors' price increases are ascribed to the cartelization upstream. Consistency requires that, for claims raised at the level of direct and indirect buyers alike, the same treatment of causation should be used. Either the cartel members should be held responsible for the entire shift in the equilibrium of the strategic game between direct buyers in suits involving indirect buyers, as well as direct buyers, or a ceteris paribus assumption should be applied to the actions of a direct buyer's competitors, which eliminates the business gain effect resulting from their price increases. In the latter treatment, which seems conceptually and procedurally the simplest, the overcharge on the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> purchased is again a lower bound for actual damages...|$|R

For example, while AUG® (the trademarked designation for e-gold) was denominated in grams and decimal fractions (or in troy ounces since, as weight units, both are related by fixed arithmetic ratio), a Spend Instruction might be specified as “Pay account 10 USD’ worth of e-gold”. Calculation of the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> to convey was made using a table of reference exchange rates maintained by the company, reflecting current actual exchange rates published by exchange providers.|$|R
50|$|However, it must {{be noted}} that the {{psychological}} phobia of radiation in sufferers may not coincide with an actual life-threatening exposure to an individual or their children. Radiophobia refers only to a display of anxiety disproportionate to the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of radiation one is exposed to, with, in many cases, radiation exposure values equal to, or not much higher than, that which individuals are naturally exposed to every day from background radiation. Anxiety following a response to an actual life-threatening level of exposure to radiation is not considered to be radiophobia, nor misplaced anxiety, but a normal, appropriate response.|$|R
