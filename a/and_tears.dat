5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{study and}} observe the changes of serum, aqueous humor <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> IL- 2, sIL- 2, NO, TAC, and SOD of {{patients}} with cataract. METHODS: Totally 60 patients with cataract in our hospital from November 2011 to September 2013 were included as the observation group, and 60 patients with eye traumas were as the control group. The serum, aqueous humor <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> IL- 2, sIL- 2, NO, TAC, and SOD of two groups were detected and compared, and the detection levels {{of patients with}} different stages were compared. RESULTS: The serum, aqueous humor <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> IL- 2, TAC, and SOD of observation group were all {{lower than those of}} control group, the sIL- 2 and NO were all higher than those of control group. The serum, aqueous humor <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> detection levels of patients at different stages had obvious differences, and the aqueous humor IL- 2 were lower than those of serum <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> the sIL- 2 were higher than those of serum <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> with statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: The change of serum, aqueous humor <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> IL- 2, sIL- 2, NO, TAC, and SOD of patients are all great, and the influence of the stages for those indexes are great too, the inflammatory response state of aqueous humor are more obvious...|$|R

Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne.

5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva <b>and</b> <b>tears,</b> do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E

By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death.

40|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the basic}} means of production, just as of all the instruments of labor, is that, {{taking part in the}} process of production during a lengthy period of time, they preserve their natural form up to the end of their productive life.

The wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of basic means is not always proportional to their age, for it depends on the volume of work performed {{and a number of other}} facts. At the same time wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> {{of the basic}} means determines their efficiency, the time of their final quitting the ranks and the time for replacement.

5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E

Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby scrapbook. While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and {{goes so far as}} blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment. Wanting outpatient treatment, she has to be placed under a conservatorship, and not wanting it to be under Esther, Kevin proposes to her and they abruptly marry again. Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a restraining order against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated when {{he was trying to get}} pregnant with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility. Kevin also accepted that he can't give Chloe the help she needs and Chloe accepts that she needs help.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness at crack initiation were determined for bovine cortical bone under tension (mode I), shear (mode II), <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> (mode III). A total of 140 compact tension specimens, compact shear specimens and triple pantleg (TP) specimens {{were used to}} measure {{fracture toughness}} under tension, shear, <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> respectively. Multiple-sample compliance method was utilized to measure the critical strain energy release rate (G(c)) at the a/W= 0. 55 (crack length, a, to specimen width, W, ratio). The critical stress intensity factor (K(c)) was also calculates from the critical loading (P(c)) of the specimens at the a/W= 0. 55. The effect of the anisotropy of bone on its resistance to crack initiation under shear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> loading was investigated as well. Fracture toughness of bone with precrack orientations parallel (designed as longitudinal fracture) and Vertical (designed as transverse fracture) to the longitudinal axis of bone were compared. In longitudinal fracture, the critical strain energy release rate (G(c)) of cortical bone under tension, shear, <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> was 644 +/- 102, 2430 +/- 836, and 1723 +/- 486 N/m, respectively. In transverse fracture, the critical strain energy release rate (G(c)) of cortical bone under tension, shear, <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> was 1374 +/- 183, 4710 +/- 1284, and 4016 +/- 948 N/m, respectively. An unpaired t-test analysis demonstrated that the crack initiation fracture toughness of bone under shear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> loading were significantly greater than that under tensile loading in both longitudinal and transverse fracture (P < 0. 0001 for all). Our results also suggest that cortical bone has been ''designed'' to prevent crack initiation in transverse fracture under tension, shear, <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.
