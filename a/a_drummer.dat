Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, <b>a</b> <b>drummer</b> and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E

In 1968, the original corps moved up from B Class competition to A Class, and the Blue Devils B was {{started as a}} younger, cadet corps.

At that time, the Blue Devils C was begun as <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> and bugle corps for even younger members.|$|R

5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and <b>a</b> <b>drummer.</b> They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} {{their first}} album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed <b>a</b> <b>drummer.</b> Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer. Belzer was chosen and Uncle Tupelo embarked on the European {{segment of the}} promotional tour for March 16–20, 1992 as the opening act for Sugar. Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months, and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement. Coomer {{was not the only}} new member added after the tour—Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the Anodyne recording sessions. They recruited multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston and bassist John Stirratt—Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs that he wrote.|$|E

Best had a cameo in the movie.|$|E
50|$|In music, <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> cadence or street beat {{is a work}} played {{exclusively}} by the percussion section of a modern marching band (see marching percussion). It is stylistically descended from early military marches, and related to military cadences, as both are a means of providing a beat while marching. Usually, each instrument will have a part that mimics <b>a</b> specific <b>drum</b> or <b>drums</b> on <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> set to create a sound similar to <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> beat.|$|R

5|$|Born in Portsmouth, Sellers {{made his}} stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, {{when he was}} two weeks old. He began {{accompanying}} his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as <b>a</b> <b>drummer</b> and toured around England {{as a member of}} the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader's wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe, which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ShowTime, and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC radio shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, took part in the successful radio series The Goon Show, which ended in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Coghill met Powderfinger when he {{attended}} {{one of their}} practice sessions and joked with the band, introducing himself as <b>a</b> <b>drummer.</b> Two years later, when Steven Bishop left the band, guitarist Ian Haug recognised Coghill at an audition, and signed him at that point. Previously, Coghill had been rejected in an audition for Custard. Jon spent about six months playing alongside Scott Coleman and Marc Zande in the Brisbane grunge band, Gland, before committing full-time to Powderfinger in early 1992. In December 1997, Coghill took a brief break from Powderfinger and toured with Regurgitator. Drummer Ross McLennan of Far Out Corporation and later from The Predators, took Coghill's place for a Powderfinger performance on 19 December.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11. Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as <b>a</b> <b>drummer.</b> In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, {{and they were going to}} use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
50|$|New {{friction}} hoists {{are less}} expensive than new drum hoists, and the lead time for delivery may be shorter as there is more competition for manufacturing. Multi-rope friction hoists have a larger lift capacity than <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> hoist. <b>A</b> friction hoist is smaller in diameter than <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> hoist for the same service, {{making it easier to}} ship and install than <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> hoist.|$|R
2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If {{you want to say}} that I was <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> major, say that I was <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> major for justice. Say that I was <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> major for peace. I was <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|R

5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} {{by the sound of}} <b>a</b> <b>drummer</b> and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band {{played at}} the same gig. Tyler {{immediately}} loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, who had been <b>a</b> <b>drummer</b> and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting he would only take part if he could be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was born. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.|$|E
