5|$|Oberon, also {{designated}} , is {{the outermost}} major moon {{of the planet}} Uranus. It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{moon was}} later {{named after the}} {{character}} Puck who appears in Shakespeare's <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream, a little sprite who travels around the globe at night with the fairies. In Celtic mythology and English folklore, a Puck is a mischievous sprite, imagined as an evil demon by Christians.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo to British parents, deHavilland and {{her younger}} sister Joan moved with their mother to California in 1919. They were brought up by their mother Lilian, a former stage actress who taught them drama, music, and elocution. De Havilland made her acting debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland. Later, she {{appeared}} in a local production of Shakespeare's <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream, which led to her playing Hermia in Max Reinhardt's stage production of the play and a movie contract with Warner Bros. Olivia deHavilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt's <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream in 1935. Her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular leading men, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made nine films. They became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. She achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedy films, such as The Great Garrick (1937), and in Westerns, such as Dodge City (1939). Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her particularly effective in historical period dramas, such as Anthony Adverse (1936), and romantic dramas, such as Hold Back the Dawn (1941). In her later career, she was most successful in dramas, such as Light in the Piazza (1962), and unglamorous roles in psychological dramas including Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).|$|E

5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E
5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented <b>a</b> <b>midsummer</b> theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano {{music and}} chamber music. His best-known works include his Overture and {{incidental}} music for <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream, the Italian Symphony, the Scottish Symphony, the overture The Hebrides, his mature Violin Concerto, and his String Octet. His Songs Without Words are {{his most famous}} solo piano compositions. After {{a long period of}} relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has now been recognised and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.|$|E
5|$|Middle English {{literature}} {{emerged with}} Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, along with Gower, the Pearl Poet and Langland.

With the English Renaissance literature in the Early Modern English style appeared.

5|$|Storytelling was a {{mainstay}} of the Igbo tradition and {{an integral part of}} the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books– including a prose adaptation of <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.|$|E
