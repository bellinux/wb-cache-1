A ninth armored cruiser, , was a much larger vessel representing an intermediate step between armored cruisers and battlecruisers. Indeed, her design had been influenced by the misinformation Britain had released about its s, which were then under construction. Once the characteristics of the new ships were revealed, Germany began building battlecruisers in response.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, are at <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> {{risk of being}} victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{was performed on}} 2, 264 horses pesented with colicn at Ghent University (Belgium) in the period 1986 - 1994. In this article, parameters {{not directly related to}} a specific type of colic are discussed. Approximately 32 % of all horses addmitted to the clinic of Internal Diseases were presented because of colic. The colic pathology was observed mainly during the spring. <b>A</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>great</b> number of mares and warmblood riding horses was observed mainly during the spring. <b>A</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>great</b> number of mares and warmblood riding horses were presented, and significantly lower number of stallions and halfblood horses.

During the period 1986 - 1994 the number of surgical interventions gradually increased. The short-term survival rate also increased progressively: {{by the end of the}} period studied, it had reached 87 % for conservative treatment and 73 % for surgical corrections. A variable successn rate after surgery was observed among the different surgeons. The determining factors for this variable success were the surgeon's individual experience in abdominal surgery and the period in which the exploratory laparotomies were performed. the success rate after non-invasive or minimally invasive surgical techniques was significantly better than after the use of invasive techniques.

5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth {{to enable them to}} crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf possesses greater buttressing when compared to all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that the gray wolf is better adapted for cracking bone than other canids. In comparison to extant North American gray wolves, Beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> number of broken teeth. The frequencies of fracture in wolves ranged from a minimum of 2% found in the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) up to a maximum of 11% found in Beringian wolves. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row also differs, with Beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with the incisors and then cracked with the carnassials and molars. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when taking and consuming large prey.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine whether low density lipoprotein (LDL) modulates the cellular action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in rat glomerular mesangial cells in culture. AVP increased cellular free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) in a dose-dependent manner. When cells were preincubated for 24 h with 10 microgram/ml LDL, the 1 x 10 (- 7) M AVP-mobilized [Ca 2 +]i was 874 nM, <b>a</b> value <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> than that of 375 nM in the intact cells. AVP caused a biphasic change in cellular pH (pHi), namely, an early acidification followed by a sustained alkalinization, and the change in pHi produced by AVP was also enhanced by LDL. AVP stimulated a 2. 2 -fold increase in [3 H]thymidine incorporation, <b>an</b> effect <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> {{in the presence of}} 10 micrograms/ml LDL. Furthermore, 1 x 10 (- 7) M AVP significantly activated mitogen-activated protein kinase from 14. 0 to 24. 5 pmol/mg protein.

25|$|Since P. exigua colonies {{consist of}} many queens, wasps {{within a given}} colony should be {{expected}} to have low relatedness among one another. However, cyclical oligogyny seems to help colonies maintain a higher level of relatedness. In cyclical oligogyny, new queens are only conceived after most of the colony’s queens have died. This late production of new queens guarantees that only a few queens from the previous generation participate. The relatedness among workers in P. exigua is 0.39, which is sufficient for wasps to exhibit worker behavior. Among queens from the same colony, 0.82 are genetically related. Therefore, queens demonstrate <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> genetic relatedness than do workers from their same colony.

25|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{elected in}} 1951 ratified the First Protocol to the ECHR in 1953 {{relating to the}} rights to property, education and free elections, but resisted the right of petition {{on the grounds that}} the common law would come under scrutiny by an international court. Labour's election in 1964 led to reconsideration of the issue and this time the only senior dissenting voice was that of the Home Secretary, Frank Soskice. Although willing to accept the right of petition, he objected to the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court on the basis that it would deprive the United Kingdom of a degree of flexibility in dealing with petitions and could lead to political embarrassment. Nonetheless, by 1965 a majority of government ministers believed that the Court would not pose <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> threat to national sovereignty or to political survival than the Commission of Human Rights to which the United Kingdom was subject. Further pressure for acceptance came from the British judge and President of the Court, Arnold McNair, 1st Baron McNair, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Peter Smithers, Terence Higgins MP and various non-governmental organisations.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} food conversion efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy input to protein output ratio of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that feed first needs to be grown for most traditional livestock. Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates need to use <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> amount of energy just to stay warm whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a food conversion twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. Allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that Allosaurus had <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>greater</b> number of stress fractures than Albertosaurus, Ornithomimus or Archaeornithomimus. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones [...] "were distributed to the proximal phalanges" [...] and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in [...] "statistically indistinguishable" [...] numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined Allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in Allosaurus provide evidence for [...] "very active" [...] predation-based rather than scavenging diets.|$|E
