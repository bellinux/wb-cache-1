5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} about the instrument to which the name was originally applied. Some identify the early theodolite as an <b>azimuth</b> <b>instrument</b> only, while others specify it as an altazimuth instrument. In Digges's book, the name [...] "theodolite" [...] described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a topographicall instrument [...] Thus the name originally applied only to the <b>azimuth</b> <b>instrument</b> and only later became associated with the altazimuth instrument. The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares [...] "graphometer" [...] to [...] "half-theodolite". Even {{as late as the}} 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a simple theodolite and the altazimuth instrument, the plain theodolite.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{indirect}} fire {{dates from the}} late 19th century. In 1882, Russian Lt Col KG Guk, published Field Artillery Fire from Covered Positions that described a better method of indirect laying (instead of aiming points {{in line with the}} target). In essence, this was the geometry of using angles to aiming points that could be in any direction relative to the target. The problem was the lack of an <b>azimuth</b> <b>instrument</b> to enable it; clinometers for elevation already existed.|$|E
50|$|Accurate heading {{information}} was {{supplied by the}} <b>Azimuth</b> Datum <b>Instrument</b> (ADI), a star tracker mounted on a periscope so that it projected its display on a plate {{in front of the}} navigator. Using angle measurements similar to those taken with a sextant, the aircraft heading could be accurately determined. For initial position fixes, Gee was replaced with the Decca Navigator System (Mark 6), which directly output measurements on three dials.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{spectrometer}} for space application has been developed to measure separately mass/charge and the three-dimensional velocity distribution of incident ions. The instrument has relatively high resolution and allows rapid measurement of the four-dimensional set of mass/charge, speed, elevation angle, and <b>azimuth</b> angle. The <b>instrument</b> includes a sector magnet, an electrostatic deflector, microchannel plate detectors with position sensitive readout, {{and a set of}} grids with variable applied voltage...|$|R
50|$|The transit {{instrument}} {{consists of a}} horizontal axis in the direction east and west resting on firmly fixed supports, and having a telescope fixed {{at right angles to}} it, revolving freely in the plane of the meridian. At the same time RÃ¸mer invented the altitude and <b>azimuth</b> <b>instrument</b> for measuring vertical and horizontal angles, and in 1704, he combined a vertical circle with his {{transit instrument}}, so as to determine both co-ordinates at the same time.|$|E

This was a gun-mounted rotatable open sight, mounted in alignment with the bore, and able to measure large angles from it. Similar designs, usually able to measure angles in a full circle, were widely adopted over the following decade. By the early 1900s the open sight was sometimes replaced by a telescope and the term goniometer had replaced [...] "lining-plane" [...] in English.|$|E
