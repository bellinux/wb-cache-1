In this paper, a novel risk-based methodology is proposed for constructing restoration strategies with stochastic availability constraints for both individual components and restoration paths. Based on a stochastic model <b>of</b> the <b>availability,</b> a multistage stochastic optimization model is constructed. A bi-level method is used to solve the proposed model. The established restoration strategy is to achieve a reasonable restoration duration subjects to operating constraints and acceptable risk levels. The proposed risk constraints are introduced into the EPRI's System Restoration Navigator (SRN) with a little modification.

In this study the Markov models, eigen vectors and eigen values for analyzing the transient <b>availability</b> and survivability <b>of</b> the system are employed. The method is implemented through an algorithm which is tested in MATLAB (matrix laboratory) programming environment.

40|$|This thesis investigates an {{extension}} of the classical best choice problem which permits attempts at recall of any item passed over at an earlier stage. Three variations of the problem of finding a policy which maximises the probability of obtaining the best of N rankable items for given probability distributions over the <b>availabilities</b> <b>of</b> items from stage to stage, are considered. One variation permits only one attempt to obtain any item, even if that attempt is unsuccessful. Another allows any number of unsuccessful attempts at obtaining an item, while the third variation assumes that, at each stage, all the information about the <b>availabilities</b> <b>of</b> items already inspected is known before a decision whether or not to obtain an item is made. The general solutions of all three problems are given in terms of the optimal control of a Markov chain through at most N steps. Analyses of the problems are carried out under additional simplifying assumptions about the probability distribution on the order <b>of</b> presentation and <b>availabilities</b> <b>of</b> the items. These analyses include sufficient conditions for the optimal policies to have certain simple forms and also the derivation of some asymptotic properties. In particular, asymptotes for the maximum probability of obtaining the best item are given and the asymptotic optimality of sequences of policies of a simple closed form is proved...|$|R

Firstly, the series-parallel multi-state system is considered and its reliability and risk characteristics are found. Next, asymptotic approach to reliability evaluation of the multi-state series-parallel system is introduced and linked with limit theorems of classical renewal theory. This join model is constructed for the system with ignored and non-ignored time of renovation. Finally, the asymptotic approach to reliability and <b>availability</b> evaluation <b>of</b> such a renewal system {{is applied to the}} port grain transportation system...|$|R
