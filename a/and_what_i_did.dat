500|$|The {{third and}} final film in the trilogy, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), {{received}} a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says [...] "each film is {{a reaction to the}} other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and thingsâ€¦ it had to be bigger and bigger. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." [...] As Full Sequence was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make Full Sequence resemble a Disney film. The movie features the tag-line [...] "100% Politically Incorrect". Both Dieter Laser and Full Sequence star Laurence R. Harvey returned in starring, albeit different, roles.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E

60|$|The parting on {{the wide}} ocean, that night, was solemn, and, in some respects, sad. We knew that several who were in la Dame de Nantes would {{probably}} be left behind, as she travelled her long, solitary path, {{in the depths of}} the ocean; and there were the chances that she, herself, might never arrive. As respects the last, however, the odds were in her favour, the American coast being effectually cleared of French privateers by that time; and I subsequently received eleven hundred and seventy-three dollars for my share in that exploit.

In view of my approaching perilous trip into the North I want to leave a fairly accurate chronicle of what I saw <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on the Middle Border. The truth is, with all my trailing about in the Rocky Mountains I have never been in a satisfying wilderness. It is impossible, even in Wyoming, to get fifty miles from settlement.

60|$|She {{was evidently}} ready for work, but I was not. I {{did not know}} exactly how to begin with such a secretary. With the others I had been outspoken from the first; I had told them what I wanted <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want, {{and they had been}} ready enough to listen and ready enough to answer. But to this silent, {{motionless}} gray figure I did not feel that I could be outspoken. No words suggested themselves as being appropriate to speak out. If I could see her face but for a moment, and discover whether she were old or young, cross-looking or gentle, I might {{know what to say to}} her. My impulse was to tell her there was a hook on which she could hang her bonnet and shawl, but as I did not know whether or not these sisters ever took off their bonnets and shawls, I did not feel at liberty to make this suggestion.|$|E
60|$|What I {{felt that}} night, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I no more {{expected}} to feel and do, {{than to be}} lifted in a trance to the seventh heaven. Cold, reluctant, apprehensive, I had accepted a part to please another: ere long, warming, becoming interested, taking courage, I acted to please myself. Yet the next day, when I thought it over, I quite disapproved of these amateur performances; and though glad that I had obliged M. Paul, and tried my own strength for once, I took a firm resolution, never {{to be drawn into}} a similar affair. A keen relish for dramatic expression had revealed itself as part of my nature; to cherish and exercise this new-found faculty might gift me with a world of delight, but it would not do for a mere looker-on at life: the strength and longing must be put by; and I put them by, and fastened them in with the lock of a resolution which neither Time nor Temptation has since picked.|$|E
