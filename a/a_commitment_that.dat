5|$|The second {{safeguard}} clause was <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> nothing {{should be done}} which might prejudice {{the rights of the}} Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this safeguard, which was drafted together with the preceding safeguard in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.|$|E
5|$|Re-formed at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, in July 1946, No.86 (Transport) Wing was {{assigned}} control of Nos.36, 37, and 38 Squadrons, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The wing was augmented by No.386 (Base) Squadron and No.486 (Maintenance) Squadron, formed in August. The Dakotas initially flew supply missions to the Australian-administered Territory of Papua and New Guinea, {{as well as}} three-times weekly courier flights to Japan {{in support of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The latter schedule continued until December 1947, when the service was taken over by Qantas Avro Lancastrians. No.37 Squadron disbanded in February 1948. In August that year, crews from Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons departed for Europe {{to take part in the}} Berlin Airlift, <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> lasted almost a year. The Australians were responsible for delivering over 16million tons of supplies, and almost 8,000 passengers.

Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children {{in the wake of the}} recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.|$|E

Before the Revolution, parishes were units of local government, and Jefferson served as a vestryman, a lay administrative position in his local parish. Office-holding qualifications at all levels—including the Virginia House of Burgesses, to which Jefferson was elected in 1769—required affiliation with the current state religion and <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> one would neither express dissent nor do anything that did not conform to church doctrine.

Bembenek, however, sought refugee status in Canada, claiming that she was being persecuted by a conspiracy between the police department and the judicial system in Wisconsin. The Canadian government showed some sympathy for her case, and before returning her to Wisconsin, obtained <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> Milwaukee officials would conduct a judicial review of her case. The review did not find evidence of crimes by police or prosecutors, but detailed seven major police blunders which had occurred during the Christine Schultz murder investigation, and she won the right to a new trial.|$|E

500|$|After the construction, Sir Richard Long and Michael Stanhope {{were placed}} {{in command of the}} castle and blockhouses; the initial {{garrison}} may have been substantial, costing around £1,000 a year, but this was mostly demobilised at the end of 1542. Nonetheless, the castle and blockhouses still proved expensive to maintain. As a result, in 1553, an agreement was reached with the corporation of Hull, under which the town would take over responsibility for their maintenance, in exchange for an annual grant of £50 from various local manors. The town provided a bond of £2,000 as <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> it would keep its commitments.

No.486 Squadron provided day-to-day servicing for each of the flying squadrons, deeper maintenance being handled by No.2 Aircraft Depot, based at the nearby RAAF Station Richmond. Courier flights to Japan continued until December 1947, a [...] round trip from Schofields. On 25August 1948, twenty staff from No.36 Squadron joined five crews from No.38 Squadron {{to take part in the}} Berlin Airlift, <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> lasted almost a year.

2500|$|Germany {{had ceased}} paying reparations in June 1931 under the Hoover moratorium, {{and most of}} the groundwork for the Lausanne conference had been done by Brüning, but Papen took all the credit for the Lausanne conference, announcing in a speech that it was his [...] "statesmanship" [...] that had freed Germany from paying reparations to France and repudiated the [...] "war guilt lie" [...] of Article 231. [...] In {{exchange}} for cancelling reparations, Germany was supposed to make a one-time payment of 3 million Reichmarks to France, <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> Papen repudiated immediately upon his return to Berlin. The British historian Anthony Nicolls noted Papen's diplomatic successes did not make Papen popular with the German people at all, which disproves the thesis that it was inflexibility {{on the part of the}} Allies in revising the terms of the Treaty of Versailles in Germany's favor that caused the rise of the Nazis.|$|E

2500|$|The Security and Freedom Ensured Act (SAFE) was {{introduced}} {{some time later}} by Republican Senator Larry Craig (R-ID). It {{was introduced}} on October 2, 2003 and was co-sponsored by Senators John E. Sununu (R-NH) and Richard Durbin (D-IL) and would have limited the scope of roving wiretaps, changed the [...] "sneak and peek" [...] delayed notification period from [...] "within a reasonable period" [...] to not later than 7 days after execution of the warrant, restored the requirements for seizure of business records that there are specific and articulate facts that business records are those of a foreign power or agents of a foreign power and prevent the use of National Security Letters {{to gain access to}} library records. It also would have extended the sunset provisions of the Patriot Act to include section 213 (Authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant), section 216 (Modification of authorities relating to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices), section 219 (Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism) and section 505 (Miscellaneous national security authorities). The EFF urged the swift passage of the bill, while Senator Russell Feingold urged the bill be passed as [...] "hese are reasonable and moderate changes to the law. They do not gut the provision. They do not make it worthless. They do recognize the growing and legitimate concern from across the political spectrum that this provision was passed in haste and presents the potential for abuse. They also send a message that fourth amendment rights have meaning and potential violations of those rights should be minimized if at all possible." [...] In Congressional debate, Rick Durbin stated that [...] "many in Congress did not want to deny law enforcement some of the reasonable reforms contained in the PATRIOT Act that they needed to combat terrorism. So, we reluctantly decided to support the administration's version of the bill, but not until we secured <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> they would be responsive to Congressional oversight and consult extensively with us before seeking any further changes in the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|It thus {{became clear}} to the Archduke that another battle would be forthcoming, {{although}} he still nourished hopes that Napoleon himself might make peace overtures. Although morale among {{the rank and file}} remained fair following Aspern-Essling, the atmosphere among the Austrian senior commanders was particularly rotten and Charles's insufficiently assiduous preparations for another battle further sapped their confidence in him. One of the senior generals, Johann von Hiller, commander of VI Korps was overtly critical of Charles's strategy and resigned on 4 July, {{on the eve of the}} battle of Wagram, giving health reasons as a pretext. Archduke Charles did make considerable efforts to rebuild his army and, despite the slow arrival of reinforcements, by the end of June, it was close to full strength again. Overall, Archduke Charles was well aware that he did not possess the means necessary to lead any offensive actions, so he promptly dismissed suggestions to run any major operations against the French base on Lobau island. A plan to march to Pressburg, cross the Danube and launch operations against the enemy's rear from there was also dismissed as strategically unsound after General Major Wimpffen noted that such a plan would leave Bohemia, the richest province still under the Austrian Empire's control, open to a French invasion. By the end of June, Archduke Charles was still hoping that Napoleon might opt to negotiate, a misapprehension that the latter encouraged through a series of ruses. In the event that a battle would indeed occur, Charles planned to remain on the defensive and thus his actions depended on the moves of the enemy. A member of the House of Habsburg, Archduke Charles saw the army as an invaluable tool, meant to protect the existence of the Monarchy. He was thus a cautious commander, never willing to risk it all in order to obtain a decisive victory, <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> he reiterated towards the end of June, when he wrote to his uncle and mentor, Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen, stating that, should another battle be unavoidable, he would [...] "strike one more blow against the French" [...] but [...] "risk nothing or as little as possible." [...] Although he reckoned that Austria would need a major victory in order to turn the tide of the war, he believed that another battle against Napoleon would have doubtful results.|$|E
