5|$|After Fermi died in 1954, the Marshalls separated. John Marshall {{returned}} to the Los Alamos Laboratory, while Leona, now effectively a single mother, became <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in 1957. The following year she became <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> the Brookhaven National Laboratory, {{at a time when}} the focus of research in physics was shifting away from the nucleus and towards elementary particles. In 1960, she joined New York University as an associate professor of physics. She became a professor in 1962.|$|E

Williams, {{also a member of}} the Labour Party, helped her with the 1954 by-election in Harwich in which she was an unsuccessful candidate.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{she became}} <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> Fermi's Institute for Nuclear Studies. She later {{worked at the}} Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and New York University, where she became a {{professor}} in 1962. Her research involved high-energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. In 1966 she divorced Marshall and married Nobel laureate Willard Libby. She became {{a professor at the}} University of Colorado, and a staff member at RAND Corporation. In later life she became interested in ecological and environmental issues, and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios in tree rings to study climate change. She was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing harmful bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984.
