5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast {{for a few weeks}} seeking <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo was small and little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.|$|E
5|$|Tim is {{kicked off}} the team after missing a week of {{practice}} when he leaves {{on the spur of}} the moment to go with Jason Street to Mexico to look for a treatment for Jason's paralysis. On returning to Dillon, Tim finds that a neighbor woman, with whom he had a brief affair, is now seeing his brother Billy and has all but moved into their house. Tim moves out but has trouble finding <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live and ultimately returns. Coach Taylor allows him to rejoin the team after he shows up at practice and on his own initiative apologizes to everyone on the team for his lack of commitment.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Ricciardo was {{the first}} driver to pit {{for a second time}} on lap 30. At the same time, a {{three-way}} fight had emerged for ninth place, with Pérez in front of Grosjean and Verstappen. On lap 32, Verstappen moved ahead of Grosjean and took another position from Pérez, who in turn lost <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> Grosjean in the same manoeuvre. Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 33, prompting Rosberg to follow suit one lap later. Hamilton briefly held the lead, but made a pit stop as well soon after, emerging to set a new fastest lap of the race albeit emerging behind both Ferrari cars. Lap 36 saw a collision between Pastor Maldonado and Marcus Ericsson, but both drivers were able to continue the race. Two laps later, Maldonado was in another fight for position with the other Sauber of Felipe Nasr, moving ahead. He ultimately received a five-second penalty for his part in the incident with Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|On lap 219, Hamlin {{moved into}} the third position, and one lap later, Martin moved up <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> fourth. On lap 222, Johnson {{increased}} his lead over Kurt Busch to almost five seconds. Six laps later, Earnhardt rejoined the race. Green flag pit stops began on lap 240; Johnson made a pit stop on lap 242, giving the lead to Kenseth. After pit stops, Johnson regained the first position. By lap 277, the drivers reported their cars becoming loose as track temperatures began to drop. Twelve laps later, Burton passed Hamlin for the second position. On lap 296, Gordon passed Ambrose to claim ninth, while Truex {{moved into the}} fifth position. By lap 302, Johnson maintained a 1.8 second lead over Burton. Two laps later, David Reutimann moved back into the top ten after passing Ambrose, while Kurt Busch moved up to sixth on lap 310. Johnson maintained his lead to win his seventh race of the 2009 season. Burton finished second, ahead of Hamlin in third, Martin in fourth, and Truex in fifth. Kurt Busch, Bowyer, Montoya, Gordon and Reutimann rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
25|$|After 1686, the Baroque {{architecture}} {{designated the}} dominant style {{of art in}} catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century. There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest {{and one of the}} finest examples of original Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful historic buildings with original Baroque façades. The Castle District is <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|In December 1940, Ahn {{was invited}} by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, arguably the world's {{greatest}} orchestra at the time. The German newspapers filled their articles about Ahn with generous praises. Ahn continued to conduct many famous orchestras in Europe. On one occasion, however, Ahn was {{barred from the}} Rome Philharmonic Orchestra for performing the Symphonic Fantasy Korea, which the Japanese government had deemed politically displeasing. Ahn found <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> work, the Orchestre de Paris, but {{he was forced to}} leave in 1944, when Paris was liberated from the German forces. He was then invited by the Spanish ambassador to conduct for the Orquestra Simfonica de Barcelona.|$|E

25|$|At 11:30 pm on {{the night}} of 27–28 January 1919, guards awoke Nicholas Mikhailovich, his brother George and his cousin Dimitri in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them they were to be moved and had to pack their belongings. They {{initially}} assumed {{that they were going to}} be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich even thought that they might be set free, but his brother assumed that they were heading to <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be shot. They had an ominous hint of what was going to happen to them when at the time of departure they were told to leave their luggage.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{a county}} civic group {{advocated}} {{for the election}} of a county executive. The group's report said that the new position would give citizens <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go if their concerns were refused by the Montgomery County Council. The group said that the fact that the county had four appointed county managers in thirteen years demonstrates that establishing the position in 1948 had not been a stunning success. The group also advocated for nonpartisan elections for council members. Among the reasons for the suggested changes in governance {{is the fact that the}} county's population had more than doubled since the governmental system had been established in 1948.|$|E
25|$|After Yu Jin's defeat, Cao Cao {{contemplated}} relocating {{the imperial}} capital from Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) to <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> avoid Guan Yu, but Sima Yi and Jiang Ji {{told him that}} Sun Quan would become restless when he heard of Guan Yu's victory. They suggested to Cao Cao to ally with Sun Quan and enlist his help in hindering Guan Yu's advances, and in return, Cao Cao would recognise the legitimacy of Sun Quan's claim over the territories in Jiangdong. In this way, the siege on Fancheng would automatically be lifted. Cao Cao heeded their suggestion. Previously, Sun Quan had sent a messenger to meet Guan Yu and propose a marriage between his son and Guan's daughter. However, Guan Yu not only rejected the proposal, but also scolded and humiliated the messenger. Sun Quan was enraged.|$|E

25|$|Wolfe arrived outside Quebec on 28 June. For much of {{the rest}} of the summer, he probed the defences of the city, trying to find a way through. Montcalm {{constantly}} frustrated him, shifting his own troops about in response. The cat-and-mouse game between the two generals reached a climax towards the end of the summer. If Wolfe could not capture the city he would likely be forced to withdraw in the face of the hostile Canadian winter. An attempt to land on the Montmorency was beaten back at the Battle of Beauport, and almost proved disastrous. Wolfe now searched for <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> land and make his attack. On 12 September the British learned of a convenient landing spot, and Wolfe moved his army there at night. The following day the Battle of the Plains of Abraham took place. It proved to be a decisive British victory, though one in which both Wolfe and Montcalm were killed. The British then took over the city.|$|E
25|$|Jewelry {{was also}} popular {{among those that}} could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in {{concentric}} circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.|$|E
25|$|Minsc is a {{supporting}} {{character in the}} 2000 novelization of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn by Philip Athans. He is depicted as a well-built man with long red hair, a patchy orange beard, and a jagged scar along {{the right side of}} his head. He is no longer a warrior, and is physically smaller than the novel's protagonist, Abdel. In contrast, Boo is unchanged, and is still referred to by Minsc as his miniature giant space hamster. Held prisoner alongside Abdel at the start of the novel, Minsc is set free and accompanies Abdel until they reach an inn, where he decides to work. Abdel repeatedly shows discomfort for his presence, using Minsc's employment as an excuse to leave him behind and steal his sword, though he later returns for his help in securing travel aboard a ship. After Abdel returns to kill his employers, Minsc realizes the inn will close permanently; he and Boo leave to find <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E

50|$|According to the Padma Purana (Patala Khanda, Ch.8), his hermitage {{was on the}} Satpura Range, {{near the}} river Payoshni. According to another tradition, his hermitage was in Dhosi Hill in the Vedic State of Brahmavarta, near Narnaul in Mahendragarh district. <b>Another</b> <b>place</b> claimed <b>to</b> be the {{location}} of Chyavana's hermitage (ashram) is Chaunsa in Buxar district of Bihar.|$|R
25|$|After the 1952 season, Veeck {{suggested}} that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis. A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, {{he was forced to}} put the Cardinals up for sale. Most of the bids came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could even begin to match, especially since he had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to leave St. Louis and find <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> play. As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Nilsson {{worked with}} Phil Spector, writing three songs with him. He also {{established}} {{a relationship with}} songwriter and publisher Perry Botkin, Jr., who began {{to find a market}} for Nilsson's songs. Botkin also gave Nilsson a key to his office, providing <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> write after hours. Through his association with Botkin, Nilsson met and became friends with musician, composer and arranger George Tipton, who was at the time working for Botkin as a music copyist. During 1964 Tipton invested his life savings – $2,500 – to finance the recording of four Nilsson songs, which he arranged; they were able to sell the completed recordings to the Tower label, a recently established subsidiary of Capitol Records, and the tracks were subsequently included on Nilsson's debut album. The fruitful association between Nilsson and Tipton continued after Nilsson signed with RCA Victor – Tipton went on to create the arrangements for nearly all of Nilsson's RCA recordings between 1967 and 1971 but their association ended in the 1970s when the two fell out for unknown reasons. Whatever the cause, it was evidently a source of lingering resentment for Tipton, {{who was one of the}} few significant collaborators who refused to participate in the 2010 documentary on Nilsson's life and career.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2005, a local Knights of Columbus {{council in}} Canada was fined $2,000 by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. The council's Hall Manager signed a {{contract}} {{for the use of}} their facilities with Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshyn, but canceled it and returned their money after they became aware that it was for the lesbian couple's wedding reception. [...] The tribunal found that the local council did not have to rent the hall if in so doing they would violate their religious beliefs. But they said the Council [...] "could have taken additional steps that would have recognized the inherent dignity of the complainants and their right to be free from discrimination". Instead of simply canceling the appointment, the court said, the council could have directed the complainants to other halls and assisted them in finding <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> hold their event.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "put down South Qiang" [...] (討南羌) {{refers to}} the area that was first {{mentioned}} in a sentence in the Western Han Essentialss (西漢會要) scroll 46 {{in relation to the}} four ancient commandery.

500|$|Jolin's artistic {{education}} {{started at}} the Technical School (later known as Konstfack) in Stockholm in 1906. The school mainly taught painting techniques and Jolin {{was more interested in}} learning about style. Within the year, he started looking for <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> continue his studies. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artist's Association) had a school on Glasbruksgatan in Stockholm. Jolin applied there in the autumn of 1907. His future teacher Karl Nordström reviewed his drawings and Jolin was admitted to the school the same year. Jolin joined the inner circle at the school, a group of Scandinavian artists who would later become known as De Unga (The Young Ones) or 1909 års män (The Men of 1909). Among these were Isaac Grünewald, Leander Engström, Birger Simonsson and Gösta Sandels. Jolin described the pupils at the school as: [...] "...a bunch of individuals with long hair, great muffler scarves and slouch hats worn askew in a way that really impressed me since I was only seventeen and the youngest of the bunch. The most amazing of them all was of course Isaac who had longer and more raven hair than anybody else and a fluttering violet scarf. I had not yet beheld such a creature. We became good friends." [...] Jolin's education at the Artist's Association was curtailed by the school's closure in the spring of 1908.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Delacour stated, [...] "We {{wanted a}} free speech area that wasn't really {{controlled}} like Sproul Plaza [...] was. It was <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> organize, <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> have a rally. The park was secondary." [...] The university's Free Speech microphone {{was available to}} all students, with few (if any) restrictions on speech. The construction of the park involved {{many of the same}} people and politics as the 1964 Free Speech Movement.|$|E
2500|$|... "Fancy digs aren't my {{priority}} when I travel," [...] wrote Phil Marty of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "but {{then you}} walk into something like Room 302 and think, 'Well, maybe I should {{spend more time in}} my room.'" [...] He praised the staff's helpfulness in finding <b>another</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> valet-park his car with two bicycles on top, and the two half-liter water bottles and Toblerone candy bars on the desk when he came in. He had a few minor complaints: at the time (2007) the hotel did not have free Wi-Fi, the room's light switch could not function as a dimmer, and the hotel would stock the mini-bar only on a guest's request.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{reasonable}} <b>place</b> <b>to</b> eat is at a café. These are plentiful, {{especially in}} the bigger cities, and usually offer soups, sandwiches, salads, cakes, pastries, and other light foods, {{in addition to the}} expected coffee, tea, beer and other beverages. Quite a few cafés serve breakfast and brunch, and some double as evening restaurants.|$|R
