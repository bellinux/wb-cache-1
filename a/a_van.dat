5|$|In 1968, the Stones, {{following}} a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control room in <b>a</b> <b>van</b> {{and created a}} mobile recording studio {{so that they would}} not be limited to the standard 9–5 hours most recording studios operated by.

5|$|In July 2011, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune investigated {{a copy of}} Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress {{owned by}} the Courtauld Institute.

The programme used chemical analysis of the paint to show that it contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E

5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is <b>a</b> <b>van</b> based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is <b>a</b> <b>van</b> chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

5|$|While {{the freeway}} was under {{construction}} in 1983, {{it was discovered that}} it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford. This revelation led to unsuccessful lawsuits to cease construction of the route. After the lawsuits, a couple of incidents happened to construction workers, including a construction worker being run over by an asphalt truck, another being blown off a bridge by strong winds, and <b>a</b> <b>van</b> carrying five construction workers randomly erupting into flames.|$|E
5|$|A panel {{very similar}} in {{description}} {{was purchased by}} the Aachen art collector Barthold Suermondt sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought {{to have come from}} Nantes, suggesting it was the same as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the Berlin museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original frame. The 1875 Berlin museum catalogue attributes <b>a</b> <b>van</b> Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the Berlin painting a copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 Berlin catalogue attributed Jan.|$|E

5|$|Additional live WeepingWillow17 videos {{are shown}} online, which police trace to <b>a</b> <b>van</b> in Union Square, where they find Willow and arrest Reggie. During interrogation, Reggie {{says he did}} not know Todd was really dead; he insists he fired a prop gun with blanks to scare Holden into {{splitting}} the money from the videos with them. Police soon learn the wadding from a blank was accidentally fired into Todd, and a horrified Reggie faces manslaughter charges. Willow, claiming to have simply been seeking fame as an actress, is released without criminal charges. The episode ends with Logan and Wheeler watching a video of Larry King interviewing Willow on a giant screen in Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from <b>a</b> <b>van</b> parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, various freeway {{projects}} in the Detroit area were cancelled or scaled back in scope. The route of I-96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled in response to freeway revolts in the city, and a new routing along the C Railroad right-of-way in Livonia was used instead. Plans to transfer the Davison Freeway in the 1970s to state control and extend it west to I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and east to <b>a</b> <b>Van</b> Dyke Freeway (extended M-53) were dropped. Another freeway project near Lansing, the Van Atta Connector, was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern freeway beltway around East Lansing, but by 1981 the highway's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project's cancellation.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} <b>a</b> <b>van</b> Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked {{the positions of the}} three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in <b>a</b> <b>van</b> he drove to the monument's base.

After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E

As Skinner and Scully monitor the operation from <b>a</b> <b>van,</b> Mulder and the other agents slowly close in on Haley. Haley hands an envelope to another man (Armin Moattar) before escaping. The agents discover that the man's flesh has been eaten away by an unknown toxin.|$|E
