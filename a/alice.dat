5|$|<b>Alice</b> {{begins to}} have {{difficulty}} answering {{the questions on}} her phone. She loses it and becomes distressed; John finds it a month later in the freezer, but <b>Alice</b> thinks it has only been missing for a day. <b>Alice</b> and John visit Anna in the hospital to meet their newborn twin grandchildren, but <b>Alice</b> does not recognize her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Entering the facility, <b>Alice</b> meets a {{holograph}} of the Red Queen's sister AI, the White Queen (Madeline Carroll). The White Queen informs <b>Alice</b> {{that her}} blood is the cure to the T-virus, defending the Red Queen's actions as well. She then tells <b>Alice</b> about Dr. Isaacs. <b>Alice</b> agrees {{to deal with}} him. On {{her way to the}} lab's lower levels, <b>Alice</b> discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from shock upon seeing <b>Alice.</b> <b>Alice</b> finds a replica of the mansion she lived in and finds Isaacs, who fights her with equal strength and telekinesis. Finding themselves in a replica of The Hive's laser corridor, <b>Alice</b> awaits the grid's arrival, watching Isaacs getting sliced into cubes. Just as <b>Alice</b> is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, which has inexplicably revived.|$|E
5|$|The Knave {{informs the}} Red Queen that <b>Alice</b> threatens her reign, and the {{soldiers}} and Bayard the Bloodhound are ordered to find <b>Alice</b> immediately. Meanwhile, the Cheshire Cat guides <b>Alice</b> to Thackery Earwicket the March Hare and Tarrant Hightopp the Mad Hatter. The Hatter helps <b>Alice</b> avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, <b>Alice</b> is found by Bayard the Bloodhound; but <b>Alice</b> insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queen's citadel and palace (which is named Salazan Grum), the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest, named Um from Umbridge. <b>Alice</b> learns that the Vorpal Sword, the only weapon capable of killing the , is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce <b>Alice,</b> but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that <b>Alice</b> be beheaded. <b>Alice</b> obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes {{on the back of}} the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the executioner, and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle. Former caterpillar Absolem advises <b>Alice</b> to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a pupa.|$|E

After weakening over land, <b>Alice</b> re-intensified over the western Caribbean, moving over western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50mph (80km/h). On June1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. <b>Alice</b> quickly weakened {{due to a}} cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June3. While near Cuba, <b>Alice</b> produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths.|$|E

Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when <b>Alice</b> cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as <b>Alice</b> is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force.

5|$|<b>Alice</b> Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against <b>Alice</b> seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that <b>Alice</b> had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. <b>Alice</b> may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. <b>Alice</b> Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alice</b> formed {{later in}} the {{calendar}} year than any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours {{later in the}} season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. <b>Alice</b> was one of only eight Atlantic tropical cyclones to form in the month of December. <b>Alice</b> was the first of two Atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in the month of January and the strongest to do so.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alice</b> {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500(1955USD). There was an earlier hurricane named <b>Alice</b> in the season. Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2. It received the name <b>Alice</b> in early 1955, though re-analysis {{of the data}} supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones {{of the same name}} in one season.|$|E

5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, <b>Alice</b> married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Eustorgius, Archbishop of Nicosia, to inquire into the {{legality}} of the marriage. <b>Alice,</b> who continued to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. <b>Alice</b> then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, but the High Court ruled that <b>Alice</b> could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli for the duration of her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join <b>Alice,</b> while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy visited with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a crusade for the Holy Land.|$|E
