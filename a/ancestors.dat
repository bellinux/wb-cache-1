5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices (usually involving {{animals and}} foodstuffs) to various deities, spirits, and <b>ancestors.</b> Deceased <b>ancestors</b> {{were thought to}} require food and drink in the afterlife, so living family members were routinely obligated to offer food and wine to the <b>ancestors</b> in a family shrine or temple.

5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless <b>ancestors</b> which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria.

5|$|Maya {{households}} interred {{their dead}} underneath the floors of their houses, with offerings {{appropriate to the}} social status of the family.

5|$|Recent {{studies of}} the DNA of European cattle and {{fragments}} of Eurasian aurochs, in particular female mitochondrial DNA and male Y chromosomes, indicate that the link between modern Limousins and their presumed Eurasian aurochs <b>ancestors</b> {{is more complex than}} originally thought.

5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that the <b>ancestors</b> of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the <b>ancestors</b> of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed {{at the base of}} a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had <b>ancestors</b> that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the <b>ancestors</b> of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.|$|E

5|$|The {{male who}} {{performs}} the shraddha {{should take a}} purifying bath beforehand {{and is expected to}} wear a dhoti. He wears a ring of kush grass. Then the <b>ancestors</b> are invoked to reside in the ring. The shraddha is usually performed bare-chested, as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony. The shraddha involves pinda-daan, which is an offering to the <b>ancestors</b> of pindas (cooked rice and barley flour balls mixed with ghee and black sesame seeds), accompanying the release of water from the hand. It is followed by the worship of Vishnu in form of the darbha grass, a gold image or Shaligram stone and Yama. The food offering is then made, cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof. The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of the <b>ancestors.</b> A cow and a dog are also fed, and Brahmin priests are also offered food. Once the <b>ancestors</b> (crow) and Brahmins have eaten, the family members can begin lunch.|$|E
