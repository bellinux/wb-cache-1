40|$|Polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) -based transformer fluids {{belong to}} a class of environmentally persistent mixtures with known toxic effects. Here, we studied the acute effects of <b>Askarel</b> (which contains Aroclor 1260) and two substitute transformer fluids (the silicone oil-based DC 561 and the mineral oil-based ENOL C) on rat testicular steroidogenesis. Single intraperitoneal (ip; 10 mg/kg body weight) or bilateral intratesticular (itt; 25 µg/testis) injections of <b>Askarel</b> markedly decreased serum androgen levels 24 hr after administration. In acute testicular cultures from these animals, chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone and androgen productions were severely attenuated. When itt was injected or added in vitro, <b>Askarel</b> inhibited 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 βHSD), stimulated 17 α-hydroxylase/lyase (P 450 c 17), and did not affect 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in testicular postmitochondrial fractions. The ip-injected <b>Askarel</b> did not affect 3 βHSD, but inhibited P 450 c 17, suggesting that a more intensive metabolism of peripherally injected <b>Askarel</b> reduces the circulating levels of active ingredients below the threshold needed for inhibition of 3 βHSD and generates a derivative that inhibits P 450 c 17. In contrast to <b>Askarel,</b> itt-injection (25 µg/testis) of DC 561 and ENOL C did not affect in vivo and in vitro steroidogenesis. These findings show the acute effects of <b>Askarel,</b> but not silicone and mineral oils, on testicular steroidogenesis.

40|$|Microbial {{degradation}} following {{aerobic biodegradation}} {{is one of}} the means used by microorganisms for the removal of persistent organic pollutants from the soil. Bacterial species namely: Pseudomonas, Micrococcus Arthrobacter and Acinetobacter capable of utilizing <b>askarel</b> oil (PCBs blend) were isolated from landfill soil samples from Uzogholo, Mgboaku and Auchi in Edo State of Nigeria. The isolation of these bacterial species followed an enrichment in minimal salt media were <b>Askarel</b> oil served as the sole carbon source. These bacterial isolates were characterized based on their cultural, morphological, biochemical characteristics and comparison with standard reference organisms. The potentials of these bacterial species to utilize <b>askarel</b> oil were assessed by measuring changes in the turbidity and pH of the enrichment medium containing varying concentrations of the <b>Askarel</b> oil. From the weekly results obtained, significant increases in the mean turbidity ranged between (0. 065 - 0. 371) and decreases in mean pH ranged between (6. 15 - 3. 55) for the 21 days incubation period. Some of the bacterial organisms exhibited remarkable utilization of <b>askarel</b> oil at different concentrations in 15 μL and 20 μL of the <b>askarel</b> minimal salt medium. From these findings, the bacterial species of remarkable potential can be isolated, re-engineered via biotechnology or bioaugmentation for effective remediation of landfill sites polluted with Polychlorinated biphenyls compounds and its derivatives in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} toxic {{industrial}} {{products such as}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in soils has become a daunting and necessary task. These compounds adsorb onto organic matter in the environment, making decontamination using traditional approaches difficult or ineffective. The use of microbes to transform these contaminants to non toxic degradation products is an alternative and imperative approach due to the prevalence of such organisms within the environment. In this study; the use of bacteria in the microbial degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls blend (<b>Askarel)</b> was explored. The notable bacteria isolated from dumpsites in Ore, Ondo state were identified using morphological and biochemical characteristics. These include: Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Corynebacteria, Bacillus, Achromobacter and Arthrobacter species. The bacterial isolates potential to utilize Polychlorinated biphenyls blend (<b>Askarel)</b> as carbon source was investigated for twenty-one days period. From the results obtained, {{there was a general}} decrease in the pH and increase in mean Optical density (O. D); were the mean pH and O. D readings ranged between (3. 08 - 6. 02 and 0. 060 - 0. 557) respectively...|$|E
40|$|Repetitive {{enrichment}} of soils {{samples from}} an agricultural land and newly marked dumpsite on electrical transformer fluid yielded six bacterial species {{that have the}} capacity to utilize electrical transformer fluids (<b>askarel)</b> as carbon and energy source. Bacterial species namely: Micrococcus, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas spp, Norcadia and Corynebacterium were identified using morphological and biochemical characteristics. The abilities of these bacterial species to utilize the electrical transformer fluids as carbon source in minimal salt medium (MSM); sub cultured in concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20 μL of electrical transformer fluids were investigated for twenty‐one days period. Physiological changes in terms of biomass increase were monitored by measuring the pH and optical density of the culture medium. From the results obtained, there was observed a general decrease in the pH and increase in Optical density (O. D). The mean pH and O. D readings ranged between (4. 34 ‐ 6. 13 and 0. 073 ‐ 0. 386) respectively. The decreased pH could justify for the acidic metabolites produced in the course of utilization of <b>askarel</b> as growth substrates. This study suggested that, the tropical ecosystems can provide exotic bacterial species that are capable of degrading or mineralizing polychlorinated biphenyls and their derivatives from dumpsites and agricultural soils...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we compare}} the {{extraction}} effectiveness of three methods commonly {{applied for the}} determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the spiked soil by transformer oil (<b>Askarel</b> oil). The techniques included are the Soxhlet extraction (SE), the Ultrasonic extraction (UE), and the Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Also a comparison of organic extracting solvents was performed in this study. The extraction conditions were not optimized for these techniques; we note that the choices of extraction parameters {{were based on the}} experience from pervious successful investigation published by a number of research groups worldwide. This study focused on the variation of the extraction quantities for each PCB congener (29 PCBs) with different extraction methods. The chromatographic analysis results obtained have showed that the mixture (n-hexane-acetone, v/v) can give the highest recoveries when compared to other solvents. The comparison made between the MAE, UE and SE methods has showed that MAE is a suitable alternative to SE for the analysis of PCBs in soils, but UE did not give a good recovery in the present work...|$|E
