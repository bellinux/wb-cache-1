5|$|In 1982 an {{exceptionally}} strong composite of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> and silicon carbide whiskers was discovered.

Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05–0.09% chlorine, 0.02–0.03% fluorine, and 0.09–0.3% sulphur.|$|E
40|$|The {{northeast}} {{region of}} Thailand possessed highly weathered soils. They contain {{a significant amount}} of iron and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> which could be important factors responsible for high proportion of applied phosphate retaining. Very little information is available on which forms of iron and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> are responsible for phosphate adsorption by the soils. This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between phosphate adsorption and forms of iron and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> in selected soils of Northeast Thailand...|$|R

5|$|Some ions are classed as amphoteric, {{being able}} to react with either an acid or a base. This is also true of some {{compounds}} with ionic character, typically oxides or hydroxides of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has significant covalent character), such as zinc oxide, aluminium hydroxide, <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> and lead(II) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances {{because of the risk}} of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction. The result is <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production. Ferroniobium {{contains}} between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.|$|E

50|$|The main {{application}} of synthetic cryolite is as a solvent (or flux) for electrolysis of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> such as bauxite. The conversion of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> into metallic <b>aluminium</b> {{requires that the}} metal ions be dissolved {{so that they can}} accept the electrons provided in the electrolysis cell. A mixture of cryolite and some aluminium trifluoride is that solvent. Unlike typical solutions, this one requires temperatures approaching 1000 °C to melt.Sodium aluminium hexafluoride is also used as a pesticide. Other uses include a whitener for enamels and an opacifier for glass.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was used}} to {{decrease}} the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market {{until the middle of}} the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices. In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Pesticides {{that get}} into soil bind mostly to its solid phase by {{physical}} or chemical processes. In {{the valley of}} the Neretva River the use of herbicides, especially of glyphosate is widespread and sometimes uncontrolled. In this work ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE) followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was applied for determining glyphosate presence in soil. The experiments were conducted with two characterised soil types. The impact of soil composition on extraction efficiency is discussed. Chemical analysis showed that soil 1 contained much more iron and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> than soil 2, which was richer in humic substances. Low glyphosate efficiency (ca 44 % in both soils) could be attributed either to its binding to iron and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> (soil 1), or to chemisorption on humic macromolecules (soil 2) ...|$|R
50|$|Aluminium is {{the most}} {{abundant}} metallic element in the Earth's crust, but it is rarely found in its elemental state.

25|$|The product <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> {{tends to}} be multi-phase, i.e., {{consisting}} of several phases of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> rather than solely corundum. The production process can therefore be optimized to produce a tailored product. The type of phases present affects, for example, the solubility and pore structure of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> product which, in turn, affects the cost of aluminium production and pollution control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> {{was taken}} off the United States Environmental Protection Agency's {{chemicals}} lists in 1988. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> is on the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory list if it is a fibrous form.|$|E

25|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{responsible}} for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin passivation layer of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> (4nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called anodising. A number of alloys, such as aluminium bronzes, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> generated by anodising is typically amorphous, but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> in the coating, enhancing its hardness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> catalyses {{a variety}} of {{reactions}} that are useful industrially.

50|$|Positive {{charges of}} soil {{minerals}} can retain anions {{by the same}} principle as cation exchange. The surfaces of kaolinite, allophane and iron and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> often carry positive charges.
