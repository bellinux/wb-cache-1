5|$|In autumn 968, {{battles between}} the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire {{commenced}} in the Principality of Capua, in the Duchy of Benevento and Apulia, and hostilities continued until 970. Both {{sides of the}} conflict made many attempts to find a diplomatic solution. Otto I intended to receive recognition of his title in Byzantium, and to clarify the borders of Western and Eastern allegiances in southern Italy. He wanted this agreement to be ratified by the marriage of his son, Otto II, {{to a member of}} the Byzantine imperial family. Anna, daughter of the deceased Emperor Romanos II, was considered a possible bride. However, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was unwilling to marry off a purple-born princess (i.e. <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>born</b> to a reigning emperor). After tough negotiations with Nikephoros II Phokas' successor John I Tzimiskes, Archbishop of Cologne Gero secured the marriage of Otto II with Theophanu, a member of the Byzantine imperial family who was not, however, born to the purple.|$|E

Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils, began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century. Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>born</b> of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted. Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes.
