Descriptions of PD {{programs}} often focus more on {{the form of}} the program than on the substance—how teachers are organized to work together, how often they meet, when and where they meet, for how long, who leads the work, the kind of activities they engage in, and so forth (Kennedy 1999). The following features of program form are included in the version of the consensus model presented earlier: active participation of teachers in analysis of practice, sufficient duration, and collective participation of teachers (teachers at a given school or grade level). The STeLLA design principles include attention to each of these consensus model features of program form. Principle 5 defines analysis of practice as a core active learning activity for teachers. Teachers are also engaged actively in content deepening <b>activities</b> (<b>principle</b> 6) and teaching <b>activities</b> (<b>principle</b> 7). Principle 8 identifies program duration and intensity as a key feature, with STeLLA teachers meeting together for 2  weeks in the summer followed by monthly ½[*]day meetings during the school year. In between meetings, they teach STeLLA lesson plans and collect and analyze student work. Principle 9 addresses the collective participation of teachers at the same grade level. STeLLA teachers meet face-to-face in small grade-level specific study groups (5 – 8) that are led by experienced PD providers.|$|R

40|$|Iron-containing antianemic drug ferric-sorbitol-citrate (FSC) {{inhibits}} {{the proliferation}} of various cancer cell lines in vitro and causes a regression of experimental murine tumors in vivo but does not affect {{the proliferation of}} nonmalignant cells. Growth modification caused by FSC iron involves a diminished ex-pression of Bcl- 2 and an overexpression of p 53 proto-oncogene, accompanied by an increased incidence of apoptosis. Aiming to evaluate further the <b>activity</b> <b>principle</b> of the anticancer effects of this antianemic drug, in this study, we analyzed the utilization of iron from FSC and the effects of FSC iron on transfer-rin receptor 1 (TfR 1) and ferritin expression. Without FSC iron, all the cell lines had an equal expres-sion of TfR 1, but if cultured in FSC-supplemented medium, human colon SW 620 and laryngeal carcinoma Hep cells exhibited a lower expression of TfR 1 -positive cells than nonmalignant Wi 38 fibroblasts and pan-creatic carcinoma MiaPaCa 2 cells. The most sensitive to FSC iron were colon carcinoma SW 620 cells, whereas Wi 38 fibroblasts were not sensitive at all. Increased iron uptake by colon carcinoma cells was noticed in the first 3 hours of the incubation with FSC iron, whereas higher FSC iron concentrations and longer incubation also impaired ferritin expression in SW 260 colon carcinoma cells. Thus, the anticancer ability of FSC could result from its higher initial utilization of iron and consecutive negative signal fo...|$|E
40|$|The local <b>activity</b> <b>principle</b> of the Cellular Nonlinear Network (CNN) {{introduced}} by Chua [1997] {{has provided a}} powerful tool for studying the emergence of complex patterns in a homogeneous lattice formed by coupled cells. This paper presents some analytical criteria for the local activity of two-port CNN cells with three or four state variables. As a first application, a coupled excitable cell model (ECM) CNN is introduced, which has cells defined by the Chay equations representing ionic events in excitable membranes in terms of a Hodgkin–Huxley type formalism. The bifurcation diagram of the ECM CNN supplies a possible explanation for the mechanism of arrhythmia (from normal to abnormal until stopping) of excitable cells: the cell parameter is changed from an active unstable domain to an edge of chaos. The member potentials along fibers are simulated numerically, where oscillatory patterns, chaotic patterns as well as convergent patterns are observed. As a second application, a smoothed Chua’s circuit (SCC) CNN with two ports is presented, whose prototype has been {{introduced by}} Chua as a dual-layer two-dimensional reaction–diffusion CNN in order to obtain Turing patterns. The bifurcation diagrams of the SCC CNN are the same as those with one port, which have only active unstable domains and edges of chaos. Numerical simulations show that in the active unstable parameter domains, the evolutions of the patterns of the state variables of the SCC CNNs can exhibit divergence, periodicity and chaos, where, in the parameter domains located in the edge of chaos, periodic patterns and divergent patterns are observed. These results demonstrate once again the effectiveness of the local activity theory in choosing the parameters for the emergence of complex patterns of CNNs...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) are a {{group of}} {{membrane}} lipids produced by {{a wide range of}} bacteria which have a high degree of structural specificity relative to bacterial source. This is the widest study to date into the BHP content of soils from around the world and investigates their use as biomarkers in modern soils and modern and ancient sediments using reversed phase HPLC-MSn. A total of 46 different BHP structures were observed during the study including the tentative identification of 11 novel BHP structures. Analysis of the BHP content in a series of soils from North East England, South West England, Canada, Sweden, Vietnam and Southern Spain has shown that soil BHP distributions are dominated by up to 5 different BHPs: bacteriohopane- 32, 33, 34, 35 -tetrol (BHT), 35 -aminobacteriohopane – 32, 33, 34 -triol (aminotriol), 30 -(5 ’-adenosyl) hopane (adenosylhopane), bacteriohopanetetrol carbopseudopentose ether (BHT cyclitol ether) and, less frequently, adenosylhopane type- 1, although generally more than 20 different BHPs are identified in each soil sample. Soil bacterial population dynamics were investigated using existing knowledge of the relationship between BHPs and their specific bacterial sources and has demonstrated, for example, a decrease in the concentration of cyanobacteria related BHPs with soil depth in pasture (Palace Leas) and woodland (Hack Hall farm) environments confirming the validity of these BHP – bacteria relationships to infer BHP producing bacterial <b>activity.</b> <b>Principle</b> Component Analysis of the different bacterial types, identified by source BHPs, in the different soils can clearly identify variations between the soils with, for example, the influence of methanotroph and cyanobacteria derived BHPs having significant and opposite effects on the separation of the soils. This potentially enables BHPs to be used to identify source locations or environments. Investigation of seasonal variations at two sites in NE England (Palace Leas and Hack Hall Farm) has shown that soil BHP concentrations increase during the summer months and decline during winter with no net accumulation indicating that the aerobic conditions observed in near surface soils result in the rapid diagenesis or metabolism of BHPs. An investigation of estuary sediments from the Congo Fan, River Rhone and 7 arctic rivers has shown that this rapid degradation of these highly functionalized structures does not occur in anaerobic marine sediments with the aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria biomarker, 35 - aminobacteriohopane- 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 -pentol (aminopentol) and other complex BHPs being identified in Congo Fan sediments up to 1 million years old (100 metres below sea floor), thus enabling BHPs to be used as biomarkers in palaeo-environments. The estuary and fan sediments also contained a suite of BHPs that are ubiquitous in soil but absent in many lacustrine and open marine environments where their concentration decreases proportionally with distance from land. These BHPs; adenosylhopane, adenosylhopane type- 1 and their C- 2 methylated homologues can therefore be used as markers for the transport of soil derived organic material (SOM) from terrestrial to marine environments. These results have opened up a wide range of opportunities for BHPs to be used as bacterial proxies in a variety of environments and ages, accessing a wide range of different proxies for different bacterial populations and processes from a single analysis.
