5000|$|According to the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center, RALs are {{controversial}} because, like payday {{loans and}} title loans, RALs are high-profit, low-risk loans marketed toward the working poor. A 2006 {{study by the}} NCLC and the Consumer Federation of America found that [...] "Based upon the prices for RALs in 2006, a consumer can expect to pay about $100 {{in order to get}} a RAL for the <b>average</b> <b>refund</b> of about $2,150 from a commercial tax preparation chain this year".|$|E
5000|$|Each year, the IRS issues tax refunds {{to tens of}} {{millions}} of Americans. In 2011 alone, the IRS issued refunds to more than 100 million Americans. That means three out of four returns filed for 2011 called for money back. All told, the government sent about $318 billion to taxpayers, with the <b>average</b> <b>refund</b> being around $2,900. Claiming allowances on the W-4 and updating it frequently effectively lets the taxpayer claim refunds ahead of time, by not overpaying in the first place. Over-withholding can occur if, for example, an employee receives a one-time bonus, as it may only take into account the current paycheck, rather than the year-to-date amount. (i.e. withholding is calculated as if the employee earned this amount every payday.) ...|$|E

Certificates {{in the program}} start at Basic, followed by Advanced, Health Savings Account/HSA, Military, International, Foreign Student, and Puerto Rico although may vary from partner to partner. Some military bases such as Like Air Force Base {{participate in the program}} in which IRS agents train service members to do military taxes. Due to the complexity of foreign students' returns, they {{are prepared}} at major public universities such as Arizona State University by more​ advanced experts. Volunteers learn tax software and tax law issues November to January of each year. One of the focal points of the VITA program is raising taxpayer awareness and receipt of the Earned Income Credit (EIC). The <b>average</b> <b>refund</b> for taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Credit was $2,450 as of 2015.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, the <b>average</b> kicker <b>refund</b> for {{personal}} incomes was $263, while the median refund was $113. The wealthiest {{one percent of}} Oregon taxpayers received one-fifth of the refund. This distribution is {{explained by the fact}} that Oregon has five state income tax brackets, from five to eleven percent, which put most of the income tax burden on high-income earners.|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we {{investigate}} whether the Earned Income Credit (EIC) leads to changes in seasonal expenditure patterns of low-income workers. We find that EIC eligible households spend approximately 3 percent move total during February, the modal month of EIC refunds, and 9 percent more on durable goods than non-eligible households. The increased spending on durable goods indicates that the EIC facilitates the purchasing of big-ticket items by low-income-families. These estimates, when converted to dollars, also suggest that EIC recipients smooth expenditure somewhat since the average increase in expenditure {{is less than the}} <b>average</b> EIC <b>refund...</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the Internal Revenue Service, 77% of {{tax returns}} filed in 2004 {{received}} a refund check, with the <b>average</b> <b>refund</b> check being $2,100. In 2011, the average tax refund was $2,913. Taxpayers {{may choose to}} have their refund directly deposited into their bank account, have a check mailed to them, or have their refund applied to the following year's income tax. As of 2006, tax filers may now split their tax refund with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their refund (rather than only spend their refund). Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax refunds even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and {{the earned income tax}} credit. Because withholding is calculated on an annualized basis, an individual just entering the work force or unemployed {{for a long period of}} time will have more tax than is owed withheld. Refund anticipation loans are a common means to receive a tax refund early, but at the expense of high fees that can reach over 200% annual interest. In the 1990s, refunds could take as long as twelve weeks to come back to the taxpayer; however, the average time for a refund is now six weeks, with refunds from electronically filed returns coming in three weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{federal tax}} system {{contains}} numerous credits, deductions, and incentives {{for individuals and}} families to build wealth and make goals like higher education more accessible and affordable. By May 2010, over 129 million American taxpayers filed federal income tax returns from the previous year, ninety-six million – or three-fourths – of {{which resulted in a}} federal <b>refund.</b> The <b>average</b> federal <b>refund</b> was $ 2, 887 for all taxpayers, and low- and moderate-income (LMI) families in particular tend to receive larger tax refunds relative to annual income. In short, tax credits and incentives represent one of the few touch points each year for LMI families to set aside money for wealth building and future aspirations, particularly for higher education. For education savings in particular, the federal government allows tax-free growth and tax-free qualified withdrawals through 529 college savings plans, Coverdells, and other savings vehicles. Many states also offer tax-free distribution, tax deductions, and other incentives for saving in 529 plans. These incentives were created to help families keep pace with the rising cost of college education. many have little or no tax liability. 1 Furthermore, extensive research has demonstrated LMI students are less likely to enroll in college or complete degrees, despite decades of nominal increases in federal financial aid. 2 Finally, a postsecondary credential {{is one of the most}} consistent predictors of upward economic mobility: only 16 However, incentives such as tax-free growth and nonrefundable tax credits carry little weight with LMI families who struggle the most with college affordability, since 1 Tax Filing statistics retrieved from IRS. gov (2010) ...|$|R
