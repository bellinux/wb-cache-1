40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether reasons for physical activity, as formulated by the self-determination theory, differed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> identified by <b>the</b> transtheoretical model of behaviour change. Methods: A total of 129 persons with schizophrenia completed the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire- 2 and the Patient-centred Assessment and Counselling for Exercise questionnaire. Multivariate and discriminant analyses {{were applied to}} determine whether reasons for physical activity differed {{between men and women}} and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change. Results: Discriminant analyses indicated that persons with schizophrenia at <b>the</b> early <b>stages</b> of change are less autonomous in the regulation of their physical activity behaviour than those at <b>the</b> later <b>stages.</b> Multivariate analyses showed a difference in amotivation, external regulation, and autonomous regulation, but not introjected regulation <b>across</b> <b>the</b> different <b>stages</b> of change. Conclusions: Our results suggest that autonomous motivation may have an important role to play in the adoption and maintenance of health promoting behaviours in persons with schizophrenia...|$|R

40|$|Cross-sectional {{analyses}} of the transtheoretical ("stages of change") model (TTM) can provide valuable information concerning the variables {{that are likely to}} shift individuals from one <b>stage</b> to <b>the</b> next. The present study was designed to investigate the roles of theory of planned behaviour (TPB) variables and attitudinal ambivalence <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change. Two samples derived from the general population completed measures of stage, TPB and attitudinal ambivalence with respect to consuming a low-fat diet (n = 148) and eating five portions of fruit and vegetables per day (n = 151). Consistent with previous research, the present study found linear increases in TPB variables <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change. However, as predicted, attitudinal ambivalence showed discontinuity patterns, displaying a quadratic relationship with <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change, such that least ambivalence was experienced in the precontemplation and maintenance <b>stages.</b> Discussion of <b>the</b> findings focuses on implications for the development of theory-driven interventions. </p...|$|R

25|$|To {{increase}} the visual interest of his show, Emerson would abuse his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating {{it with a}} whip, pushing it over, riding it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine {{cognitive}} variables that predicted an individual's relationship with exercise and to obtain the self-reported activity levels of Whites and Latinas. Self-efficacy for exercise, hope, the pros and cons of change, and attitude towards exercise were tested as possible predictor variables and <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change from the transtheoretical model was the primary dependent variable. Of specific interest was whether hope theory explained unique variance <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change. A cross-sectional design compared White and Latina female college students (N= 112), and two versions of <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change measure in the same population.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a hybrid {{implementation}} of the mul-tistage constant modulus (CM) array for separating corre-lated signals. Using a cascade architecture of the CM array {{with a series of}} adaptive signal cancelers, we derive a par-allel set of constrained beamformers. The canceler weights provide estimates of the direction vectors of <b>the</b> captured sig-nals <b>across</b> <b>the</b> cascade <b>stages,</b> which are used in a parallel implementation of the linearly constrained CM (LCCM) ar-ray. Since the direction vectors are obtained directly from the canceler weights, the hybrid implementation does not require prior knowledge of the array response matrix. If the source signals are sufficiently separated in angle, then they can be captured individually <b>across</b> <b>the</b> parallel <b>stages.</b> When <b>the</b> sources are correlated, the cascade CM array does not com-pletely cancel the captured signals, and previous versions of the parallel CM array do not always capture different sources <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages.</b> These problems are handled by the pro-posed hybrid LCCM architecture based on the signal can-celer constraints. Computer simulations for example cochan-nel scenarios are provided to illustrate some properties of the system. 1...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Motivation {{is deemed}} a {{critical}} component for interventions intended to change behaviors related {{to the use of}} alcohol and other drugs. The classification of patients in 'stages of change' can be a useful tool for the organization and improvement of treating programs. METHODS: This study assessed <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change using the scales URICA and SOCRATES in patients who attended two different treating programs for alcohol dependence in a specialized medical service. We performed an analysis of <b>the</b> association between <b>stages</b> of change and demographic aspects. After three months of treatment, patients were reassessed to evaluate their outcome. RESULTS: In the assessments using URICA, there was an association between stages of change and monthly income and age. There was no evidence that patients move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change. Using the scale SOCRATES, we found an association between stages of change and monthly income. In the reassessment, there was a significant movement <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change. CONCLUSION: Patients who attend two different treating programs may have different motivation profiles. There was no movement congruent with <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of change model, suggesting that patients may need more than 3 months to obtain significant changes in their motivation...|$|R

500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one foot up on the keyboard. Once again, she staggered <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed on the stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance was for her fans: [...] "I wanted to say something honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off on stage the whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would be at home cheering and swooning." [...] In a poll conducted by Billboard, the performance was ranked as the fourth best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} {{multi-stage}} contest that resolves in each stage {{only with a}} given probability. Assuming that there is unobservable heterogeneity in intrinsic motivations we derive properties of <b>the</b> equilibrium efforts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> different <b>stages.</b> Whereas in <b>the</b> corresponding complete information benchmark equilibrium efforts are stable <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages,</b> uncertainty about <b>the</b> type distribution of possible opponents generates learning. We identify reasons for dynamic adjustments of efforts caused by belief formation and updating and by selection of certain types into continuing conflict. A corresponding experimental setup provides evidence for escalation of efforts in later stages, for type heterogeneity, for belief formation and belief updating, and for self-selection. Overall, our results suggest the importance of an appropriate benchmark model when testing predictions on behavior in conflict or related strategic interactions...|$|R
