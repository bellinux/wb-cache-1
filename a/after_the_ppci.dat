40|$|Background: The term no-reflow {{was first}} used by Majno and colleagues {{in the setting of}} {{cerebral}} ischemia in 1967. This phenomenon was initially described by Krug et al. during induced myocardial infarction in the canine model in 1966 and again by Kloner et al. in 1974 in which it occurred for 90 min after temporary epicardial coronary artery occlusion. Myocardial tracers, such as carbon black or thioflavin S were injected to document uniform flow distribution across the myocardial tissue after 40 min of occlusion. After 90 min, persistent subendocardial perfusion defects were seen with no-reflow. Objectives: Detection, prevention, and treatment of no-refloware likely to have an important impact on the outcome of PPCI. Here we propose possible personalized forms of prevention and treatment, {{on the basis of the}} notion that no-reflow is a dynamic process characterized by multiple pathogenetic components. Methods: We analyzed a total of 120 consecutive patients with STEMI and treated with PPCI between 1 st of November 2016 to July 2017 at our institution. The patients are divided into two groups according to the final TIMI flow after the primary PCI, and the incidence of in hospital MACE as follows: Group A: had a normal flow <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>PPCI</b> and did not have in hospital MACE; Group B: had either no reflow <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>PPCI</b> or experienced in hospital MACE. Results: The incidence of no reflow was 13. 2 %, and in hospital MACE was 5 %, with cardiac death as the predominant form of in hospital MACE. The group with no reflow or in hospital MACE showed significantly older age, longer door to balloon time, higher levels of admission RPG, N/L ratio, and MPV. Compared to the literature, Egyptian patients had more diabetes mellitus, more dyslipidaemia, longer door to balloon time. Conclusions: Older patient age, longer door to balloon time, admission hyperglycemia, higher admission N/L ratio, MPV, longer reperfusion time, elevated level of high sensitive CRP on admission, and markedly elevated levels of CKMB, large thrombus burden LTB, are useful predictive factors for the occurrence of no reflow post PPCI, and/or in hospital MACE...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare various parameters between complete and incomplete ST-segment resolution (STR) patients' groups and to identify associates of STR in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) (primary outcome). Materials and methods: A total of 203 consecutive patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of STR: < 70 % (incomplete) and ≥ 70 % (complete resolution) 5 – 15  min <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>PPCI.</b> The cardiovascular risk factors, sex, Killip class, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow, symptom-onset-to-balloon time and door-to-balloon time, and adverse cardiovascular events (secondary outcome) were assessed and compared between two groups. Results: There were 147 patients with incomplete STR and 56 patients with complete STR. Patients with complete STR were younger, had lower Killip class, shorter duration of the chest pain and were less likely to have anterior myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients in the incomplete STR group had longer symptom-onset-to-balloon and door-to-balloon intervals. TIMI 3 flow after PPCI was more common in the complete STR group. TIMI flow ≤ 2 after PCI, AMI and symptom onset-to-balloon time were inversely associated with STR (beta coefficients − 28. 635, − 28. 611, and − 0. 917, respectively). AMI (OR =  29. 9), symptom onset-to-balloon time (OR =  1. 7) and patient's age (OR =  1. 1) were associated with an increased likelihood of having incomplete STR. Conclusions: Patients with complete STR were younger, had lower Killip class, shorter duration of STEMI, were less likely to have AMI, were more likely to recover TIMI 3 flow. Age, TIMI-flow grade 2 or less after PPCI, AMI and symptom-onset-to-balloon time were associated with STR...|$|E
