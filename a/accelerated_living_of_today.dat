40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} {{collective}} excrement apparatus of Kampala, or the “shitscape”. I consider the diverse {{ways that the}} city’s inhabitants utilise different materials to manage their daily defecation, from flush toilets and latrines to plastic bags, septic tanks, and wastewater channels. In doing so, I unravel the historical and contemporary construction of toileting as {{a critical component of}} the modern city in the global south, and the everyday role of excrement in the inclusion and exclusion of Kampala’s inhabitants. The shitscape therefore invites a discussion of how the city’s sanitation infrastructures are thought about and implemented in a way that both reflects and reinforces the socio-economic disparities of its residents. The thesis begins with an historical analysis of how the city was shaped by colonialism and how this affects the contemporary shitscape in terms of ideas about urbanity, modernity, and hygiene, and then analyses how the material and symbolic groundwork of the colonial period is extended into the planning and <b>living</b> <b>of</b> <b>today’s</b> city. Tracing the city’s main wastewater channel through affluent areas and informal settlements of central Kampala, I use ethnographic and qualitative methods to understand the everyday toileting materialities and performances, and its role in {{the ways in which the}} city is read, perceived, and lived by its inhabitants. The study’s primary theoretical contribution is to contribute to Lefebvre’s theories about the production of urban space by bringing it into conversation with postcolonial and feminist literatures that knit together bodily function and material infrastructure. This everyday look at the how the city’s shitscape operates ultimately offers ways to challenge prevailing notions of urbanity, and prompts thinking about alternative possibilities for how city life is conceptualised...|$|R

40|$|Adam Smith {{is almost}} {{certainly}} history’s most famous advocate of commercial society, but hefrankly admits that the relentless pursuit of wealth is a major obstacle to tranquility and content-ment and hence that, at first glance, the higher living standards that people “enjoy ” in commercial society seem to come only {{at the cost of}} their happiness. I argue that the solution to this apparent paradox can be found in Smith’s account of the positive political effects of commerce: dependence and insecurity are the chief obstacles to happiness and have been the hallmarks of most of human history, and so the alleviation of these ills in commercial society constitutes a great step forward. Money really cannot buy happiness, but the liberty and security that commercial societies tend to provide help to assuage the greatest sources of misery. In the eighteenth century, when commercial soci-ety in the fullest sense was first emerging, thinkersas disparate as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Justus Möser blamed this kind of society for making people miserable in the name of prosperity, for encouraging people to continually toil and chase after material goods that could never truly satisfy them (cf. Muller 2002). Such criticisms have, if anything, multiplied over time: despite (or perhaps because <b>of)</b> the unprece-dented <b>living</b> standards <b>of</b> <b>today’s</b> commercial societies...|$|R

Empirically, space-time inconsistency is extensive. Theoretically, space-time consistency prevails if the consumer’s utility function (or the revenue (GDP) function) is homothetic and if Divisia price indices are used to deflate nominal consumption (or GDP), both over time and across countries. Hence the inconsistency we observe is due to either (a) non-homotheticity in consumption (or production); (b) approximation error when discrete chain indices are used instead of continuous Divisia indices; or (c) errors in domestic price indices and PPPs. Based on detailed data from the 1980 and 2005 International Comparisons Program and the Penn World Table, I conclude that errors in price indices and PPPs are the major cause of inconsistency...|$|R

I have determined that the issues of individuality, independence, and the atmosphere of a “home” are just as important to the aging as are the issues of services and security. So, for the people who would like to live in a planned environment, I have created a program where the elderly will be encouraged to express their own personal concerns as a group in order to shape their own community. I have labeled this program a “renovated residential community. ” The program will renovate various houses in an existing neighborhood in which the elderly will reside in group living situations. The central program will offer support and services only if requested.
