40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} {{is the leading}} genetic cause of infant death, and much {{research}} has gone into the development of potential therapies for the disease. It {{is caused by a}} loss of the SMN 1 gene. However, patients have the SMN 2 gene, which contains a few silent mutations causing the skipping of exon 7 during splicing. One of the most promising therapeutic strategies involves the use of antisense oligonucleotides to rescue the splicing of SMN 2 exon 7, allowing for production of full length SMN protein. One successful antisense oligonucleotide strategy involves the use of a bifunctional targeted oligonucleotide enhancer of splicing (TOES) (Skordis et al., 2003). This oligonucleotide, named GGA, consists of an <b>annealing</b> <b>region</b> that targets it to SMN 2 exon 7 and a non-annealed enhancer tail domain, designed to recruit activator proteins and stimulate inclusion of exon 7. However, the precise mechanism by which GGA induces exon 7 inclusion was not fully understood at the time of design. This study has focused on investigation of the mechanism of action of GGA, in order to improve the therapeutic potential for GGA and future TOES. GGA was found to bind directly to SRSF 1, an activator protein, via its enhancer tail domain. The tail domain forms a G-quadruplex structure in vitro (Smith et al., manuscript submitted). The presence of this structure in nuclear extracts was confirmed, and the enhancer domain was found to bind the G-quadruplex associated proteins CNBP and nucleolin. Stabilization of this structure using ligands reduced the efficacy of GGA, indicating that GGA does not form a G-quadruplex when it is actively stimulating SMN 2 exon 7 inclusion. Single molecule methods revealed that the annealing domain of GGA, which anneals over an exonic splicing silencer shown to bind hnRNP A 1 and/or Sam 68 (Kashima et al., 2007; Pedrotti et al., 2010), reduces the number of Sam 68 proteins bound per SMN 2 RNA.

40|$|Samples of HgBa 2 CuO(4 +delta) (Hg- 1201) were {{annealed}} {{under various}} conditions. After carefully controlling annealing time, annealing temperature (T(sub a)) and O 2 partial pressure (P(sub 0)), {{we were able}} to find the reversible annealing conditions for Hg- 1201. Under 1 atm O 2 at 260 C {{less than or equal to}} T(sub a) less than or equal to 400 C, the obtained T(sub c) is nearly the same (approximately 97 K). However, it decreases quickly with T(sub a) greater than 300 C in high vacuum (P(sub 0) approximately 10 (exp - 8) atm), and reaches zero at T(sub a) = 400 C.

The investigation is concentrated on the <b>annealing</b> temperature <b>region</b> in which the magnetic M-phase dominates. In addition to the data obtained from static hysteresis loops we determined the anisotropy field from microwave measurements. One result is that three <b>annealing</b> temperature <b>regions</b> must be distinguished. In the first region (Ta ≤ 600 °C) thermal agitation influences the magnetic properties. Above this temperature the crystals achieve very good hard magnetic properties (e. g. HcJ= 488 kA/m at Ta= 800 °C).

40|$|We {{have studied}} the laser thermal {{annealing}} (LTA) effects on single crystal GaP. The samples have been analyzed by means of Raman spectroscopy, glancing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIRXD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. After LTA process, the Raman spectra of samples annealed with the highest energy density show a forbidden TO vibrational mode of GaP. This result suggests the formation of crystalline domains with a different orientation in the <b>annealed</b> <b>region</b> regarding the GaP unannealed wafer. This behavior has been corroborated by GIXRD measurements. TEM images show that the LTA produces a defective layer with disoriented crystalline domains in the surface. The depth of this defective layer increases with the energy density of LTA. The lack of crystallinity after LTA processes could be related with the high bond energy value of GaP...|$|R

However, a few protocols use these tails in the field of food inspection. In this study, two types of M 13 tails (by Steffens and Messing) were selected to assess their benefits using universal cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 SrRNA) primers in standard procedures. The primer characteristics were tested in silico. Then, using 20 DNA samples of edible species (birds, fishes, and mammals), their performance during PCR amplification (band recovery and intensity) and sequencing (sequence recovery, length, and Phred score) was assessed and compared. While 16 SrRNA tailed and non-tailed primers performed similarly, differences were found for COI primers. Messing’s tails negatively affected the reaction outputs, while Steffens’ tails significantly improved the band intensity and the length of the final contigs based on the individual bidirectional read sequence. This different performance could be related to a destabilization effect of certain tails on primers with unfavorable mismatches on the <b>annealing</b> <b>region.</b> Even though our results cannot be generalized because the tail performances are strictly dependent on laboratory conditions, they show that appropriate tails can improve the overall throughput of the analysis, supporting food traceabilit...|$|E
40|$|The two {{principal}} determining steps in molecular diagnosis are the amplification and the identification steps. Accuracy of DNA amplification is primarily {{determined by the}} annealing sequence of the PCR primer to the analyte DNA. Accuracy for identification is determined either by the <b>annealing</b> <b>region</b> of a labelled probe for the real time PCR analysis, or the annealing of a sequencing primer for DNA sequencing analysis, that binds to the respective analyte (amplicon). Presently, housekeeping genes (Beta globin, GAPDH) are used in molecular diagnosis to verify that the PCR conditions are optimum, and are thus known as amplification controls [1 – 4]. Although these genes have been useful as amplification controls, they lack the true definition of an internal control because the primers and annealing conditions are not identical to the analyte being assayed. This {{may result in a}} false negative report [5]. The IC-Code platform technology described here provides a true internal control where the internal control and analyte share identical PCR primers annealing sequences for the amplification step and identical sequencing primer annealing sequence for the identification step. • The analyte and internal control have the same PCR and sequencing annealing sequences. • This method assures for little or no false negatives and false positives due to the method’s design of using identical annealing conditions for the internal control and analyte, and by using DNA sequencing analysis for the identification step of the analyte, respectively. • This method also allows for a set lower limit of detection to be used by varying the amount of internal control used in the assay...|$|E
30|$|Recently, NGS-based, transcriptome-wide {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} to probe the RNA secondary structures, such as dsRNA sequencing (dsRNA-seq) (Kwok et al., 2015). The dsRNA-seq library is prepared by treating the total RNAs with the ribonuclease specific for the single-stranded RNAs, thus enabling researchers to detect the <b>annealed</b> <b>region</b> within an RNA sequence, or between two transcripts. Currently, the plant dsRNA-seq data is only available for Arabidopsis. These dsRNA-seq datasets were prepared not only from the wild type (WT) plants, but also from the nrpd 1 and rdr 6 mutants (Table 3). Thus, the Pol IV and RDR 6 dependence of the dsRNA precursors could be interrogated by using these datasets. In addition to the dsRNA-seq data, sRNA-seq data of nrpd 1, rdr 2 and rdr 6 should also be valuable to investigate the biogenesis pathways of the sRNA precursors (Table 3).|$|R

After annealing the irradiated microbridges at 500 C in an oxygen atmosphere, the implanted region has a reduced but finite transition temperature, allowing Josephson coupling in a temperature window of < 15 K. Close to the coupling temperature the critical current shows a nearly complete modulation in an applied magnetic field. This indicates a homogeneous current {{distribution in the}} junctions and therefore a homogeneous defect distribution throughout the implanted and subsequently <b>annealed</b> <b>region</b> of the superconducting microbridges.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{residual}} stresses in a pipe girth weld in a ferritic-martensitic power plant steel were measured by neutron diffraction and {{compared with the}} corresponding metallurgical zones in the weld region. It was found that, in both the as-welded and post-weld heat treated condition, the highest tensile stresses resided near the outer boundary of the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and towards the weld root region. Substantial tensile direct and hydrostatic stresses existed across the HAZ, including the fine-grained and intercritically <b>annealed</b> <b>regions,</b> where premature type IV creep failures manifest in 9 – 12 Cr steel welds.

40|$|The {{sequencing}} of the crustacean {{collection of the}} MNHN, Paris, constitutes a promising yet very challenging barcoding project. For the collection's crustacean specimens preserved in ethanol, {{some of which were}} collected up to 40 years ago, the conventional COI barcoding procedure of amplification with Folmer primers failed {{for more than half of}} the specimens (58 %, n = 1920). We hypothesised that this failure may have been due to incompatible mismatches between the crustaceans targeted and the Folmer primer sequences and/or the amount of degradation of the DNA extracted from museum specimens. The comparison of the Folmer primers against the COI sequences from GenBank complete decapod mitochondrial genomes revealed that the <b>annealing</b> <b>regions</b> were, in fact, rather conserved, suggesting that the amplification failures were due more likely to the low quality of the DNA isolated. Using an alignment of all available decapod sequences we designed two internal primers in the middle of the barcoding COI region and also selected two additional external primers to be used as alternative to the standard Folmer primers. Using a two-overlapping-fragments amplification strategy and different primer combinations, our new protocol significantly increased the amplification success rate of the collection material from 42 % with the Folmer primers to 84 %, recovering an additional 364 complete barcodes and 443 minibarcodes (i. e. fragments of less than 400 base pairs), and expanding the species coverage from 254 to 397 barcoded crustaceans...|$|R

Recent advances in PCR technology have facilitated {{the development of}} real-time fluorescence PCR assays with greatly reduced amplification times and improved methods {{for the detection of}} amplified target sequences. We developed and evaluated two such assays for the LightCycler instrument: one that simultaneously detects the genes for Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (stx 1 and stx 2) and another that simultaneously detects the genes for intimin (eae) and enterohemolysin (E-hly). Amplification and sequence-specific detection of the two target genes were completed within 60 min. Findings from the testing of 431 STEC isolates of human and animal origin, 73 isolates of E. coli negative for stx genes, and 118 isolates of other bacterial species with the LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assays were compared with those obtained by conventional block cycler PCR analysis. The sensitivities and specificities of the LC-PCR assays were each 100 % for the stx 1, eae, and E-hly genes and 96 and 100 %, respectively, for the stx 2 gene. No stx 2 genes were detected from 10 stx 2 f- positive isolates because of significant nucleotide differences in their primer <b>annealing</b> <b>regions.</b> Melting curve analyses of the amplified Shiga toxin genes revealed sequence variation within each of the tested genes that correlated with described and novel gene variants.

In higher eukaryotes, DNA DSBs are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but DNA ends can also be joined by an alternative error-prone mechanism termed microhomologymediated end joining (MMEJ). In MMEJ, the repair of DNA breaks is mediated by <b>annealing</b> at <b>regions</b> of microhomology and is always associated with deletions at the break site.

Based on the results the following conclusions are drawn: 1) By applying the novel surface hardening technique the hardness and the wear resistance of the steel X 5 CrNiCuNb 16 - 4 can be significantly improved. 2) By altering {{the parameters of the}} laser and aging treatments the required hardness and depth of the surface age hardened zone can be easily adjusted. 3) In the laser solution <b>annealed</b> surface <b>region</b> a thermally more stable martensitic structure is produced than by conventional solution annealing avoiding thermal recovery during rapid cooling from laser solution annealing to room temperature and the formation of reversed austenite during aging. 4) In the laser solution annealed and subsequently aged surface region a more homogenous and finer precipitation arrangement of small Cu-rich precipitates is formed than in the conventionally heat treated samples.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{crystallography}} for diffusion-induced recrystallization (DIR) in the Ni(Cu) system, Cu/Ni/Cu diffusion couples were prepared by a diffusion bonding technique from a pure Cu single-crystal specimen and a pure Ni polycrystalline specimen, and then isothermally annealed at a temperature of 923 K for various times of 1 - 60 h. The Miller indices of the Cu specimen along the Cu/Ni interface are (111). The notation A (B) means that a solute B diffuses into a pure metal A or a binary A-B alloy with the A-rich single-phase microstructure. Due to DIR during <b>annealing,</b> a <b>region</b> with fine grains alloyed with Cu is produced into the Ni specimen from the Cu/Ni interface in the diffusion couple. The orientation relationship between the fine grain in the DIR region and the Cu or Ni specimen was analyzed by an electron backscattered diffraction technique as well as transmission electron microscopy. Orientation relationships close to but not identical to the cube/cube relationship exist between the Cu specimen and many fine grains in the DIR region. The chemical driving force {{for the formation of}} the DIR region, the boundary energy and the boundary diffusion coefficient were evaluated by mathematical models. According to the evaluation, it is likely that fine grains surrounded by small-angle boundaries are formed and grow moderately during DIR...|$|R
2500|$|Matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization/time {{of flight}} mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) combined with base extension after PCR allows cell free fetal [...] DNA detection with single base specificity and single DNA molecule sensitivity. DNA is first amplified by PCR, then linear amplification with base extension reaction (with a third primer) {{is designed to}} <b>anneal</b> to the <b>region</b> upstream of the mutation site. Either 1-2 bases {{are added to the}} extension primer to produce two extension products from wild-type DNA and mutant DNA. Since single base specificity is achieved, it is better than hybridization-based techniques with Taqman probes. According to Ding et al., no false negatives were found and no false positives were detected when looking for fetal DNA across 16 individuals. A study by Akolekar and colleagues in 2010 genders of 90/91 males babies were confirmed, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry had a 99.1% accuracy with 98.9% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity.|$|R
