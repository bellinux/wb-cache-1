While it was a revolutionary book {{containing}} many breakthrough ideas, it contained <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> which have since been proven false. One of these was the idea that the northeast or east part of a structure was the least safe, and should be avoided when seeking shelter from a tornado.|$|E

[...] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was [...] "almost nil", he and Ditko had [...] "worked on storyboards together and I added <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas.</b> But {{the whole thing was}} created by Steve on his own...

500|$|Syphon Filter {{received}} [...] "critical acclaim" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Edge stated that, although the game borrows elements from both GoldenEye 007 and Metal Gear Solid and that [...] "the execution {{could have been}} better accomplished, Eidetic [...] <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> of its own, and these {{go a long way}} towards providing the game with its own identity." [...] The blend of a stealth-action hybrid gameplay was praised by most critics. Doug Perry of IGN enjoyed the implemented skill-based action that he considered was [...] "hard to come by in a PlayStation game". Perry praised the game's detail and advanced graphics, but criticised the low resolution and noting that the game's frame rate was [...] "not perfect". Despite this, he noted that what Syphon Filter [...] "gives up in frame rate [...] provides in character and environment detail".|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} eight months of development, game {{director}} Cory Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen (lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II, respectively) became director. In an interview with IGN, Asmussen said that Barlog [...] "had a major impact on the game" [...] and although he had left the team, they spoke several times afterwards and [...] "bounced <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> off him," [...] but there was no formal collaboration. He also said that David Jaffe [...] " [...] been around the studio a few times" [...] and they [...] " [...] gone over some high-level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback." [...] Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a cooperative mode [...] "if we can do something unique with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told GamePro that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for God of War III: [...] "There's a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that." [...] By December 2009, the game was in its final developmental stages.|$|E

Overall, Sowell said that the collection was able to explain that [...] "One of the most telling examples of the social destructiveness of the left's welfare-state vision can be found among the white slum dwellers in Britain." [...] Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer, Theresa K. Weaver, called the collection [...] "saddening, infuriating, and ultimately not terribly empowering", stating that she wishes Dalrymple [...] "might at least offer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> on turning everything around." [...] Arthur Foulkes of the Carolina Journal {{described it as}} a [...] "fine book" [...] that [...] "offers much to friends of liberty everywhere." [...] Roger Donway of The Atlas Society considered it to be [...] "one of the most instructive books that I have read in many years". Stephen Goode, writing for Insight on the News, said that the collection argued its [...] "position brilliantly and with impressive passion". The National Observer wrote that it [...] "has much value", if it is taken as an [...] "antidote to fashionable loose thinking".|$|E

Jackson stated [...] "I {{want to do something}} different, I have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> and hopefully the fans will embrace it." [...] The first date was planned for September 17, 2004. It was initially postponed due to Jackson focusing on the presidential election occurring within the same time period, commenting [...] "we desperately need a Democrat as president"; as well as blacklisting from major companies regarding fines following Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show incident. After the election period, Jackson was approached to record her next studio album 20 Y.O. and postponed all plans for touring. One of the tour's several planned opening acts was Mario Winans, known for the hit [...] "I Don't Wanna Know" [...] with Enya. Janet would later perform music from Damita Jo in her 2017 State of the World Tour, such as [...] "Spending Time With You" [...] and [...] "Island Life".|$|E
2500|$|A {{community}} of psychotherapists and students began to form around Bandler and Grinder's initial works, {{leading to the}} growth and spread of NLP as a theory and practice. For example, Tony Robbins trained with Grinder and utilized <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> from NLP {{as part of his}} own self-help and motivational speaking programmes. Bandler led several unsuccessful efforts to exclude other parties from using NLP. Meanwhile, the rising number of practitioners and theorists led NLP to become even less uniform than it was at its foundation. Prior to the decline of NLP, scientific researchers began testing its theoretical underpinnings empirically, with research indicating a lack of empirical support for NLP's essential theories. [...] The 1990s were characterized by fewer scientific studies evaluating the methods of NLP than the previous decade. Tomasz Witkowski attributes this to a declining interest in the debate {{as the result of a}} lack of empirical support for NLP from its proponents.|$|E

2500|$|By November 1941, many of {{the initial}} assembly-line {{challenges}} had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>ideas</b> for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , {{as would be expected}} in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about [...] during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.|$|E
