5|$|After {{the release}} of Magnolia, Anderson stated {{that he would like}} to work with comedic actor Adam Sandler in the future and that he was {{determined}} to make his next film <b>a</b> <b>comparatively</b> shorter length of just 90 minutes.

The story centers on a beleaguered small-business owner (Sandler) with anger issues and seven emasculating sisters. A subplot in the film was partly based on David Phillips (also called The Pudding Guy). Sandler received critical praise for his role in his first major departure from the mainstream comedies that had made him a star. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.|$|E

Members of the Psittacula genus commonly have large, red beaks, and long tail feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its congeners in other osteological details.

Its colouration also separated it from all other members of Psittacula, the majority of which are green or partially green.|$|E
