25|$|Another {{explanation}} may be: This is {{the name}} of the author of the wise sayings provided in Prov. 30. Either this was a real person, or <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> suggested, it was a fanciful name for Solomon. Proverbs 30 says that he was the son of Jakeh (Hebrew: “Yaqeh”) which means “to obey” or “obedient.” Again, this is either a real person, or another symbolic name for Solomon.|$|E

The Doctor and Steven are taken aback when she introduces herself as Dodo Chaplet and reveals that her grandfather was French. The Doctor speculates that Dodo might be Anne's descendant. (<b>As</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> pointed out, this would mean Anne lived to have an illegitimate offspring unless she or a descendant married a man of the same name).|$|E

25|$|Seventeen horses contested {{the first}} Melbourne Cup on Thursday 7 November 1861, racing for the modest prize of 710 gold sovereigns (£710) cash and a hand-beaten gold watch, winner takes all. The prize was not, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> suggested, the largest purse {{up to that}} time. A large crowd of 4,000 men and women watched the race, {{although}} it has been suggested this was less than expected because of news reaching Melbourne of the death of explorers Burke and Wills five days earlier on 2 November. Nevertheless, the attendance was the largest at Flemington on any day for the past two years, {{with the exception of the}} recently run Two Thousand Guinea Stakes.|$|E
25|$|Francis of Assisi {{was born}} in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several {{children}} of Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and his wife Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except {{that she was a}} noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis {{was born in}} Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have {{had anything to do with}} his aptitude for learning French, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> thought.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimension}} of physical quantities {{of interest in}} mechanics can be {{expressed in terms of}} base dimensions M, L, and T – these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (<b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a change of basis. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must span the space, and be linearly independent.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{contends that}} Mulford {{did not make}} serious claims to victory later in life, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> suggested. And in fact the {{controversy}} itself did not begin to inflame until decades after the race. Likewise, internet-based urban legends, and a book published in 2011, have fueled the meme. It {{is also possible that}} Mulford's statements in the Detroit Free Press interview were misunderstood or purposely misconstrued. While giving full credit to Harroun for winning the race, Mulford did for himself claim the world record for 500 miles driven solo (Harroun had relief help from Cyrus Patschke). He also made the laregely inconsequential claim that minus the stoppage time needed for pit stops (over 14 minutes), he likely completed the 500 miles (running time only) in less elapsed time than Harroun & Patschke.|$|E
25|$|Under Pope Callistus III, in 1455, he was {{appointed}} an arbiter on the questions at issue between the Conventuals and Observants. His decision was published 2 February 1456 in a papal bull, which pleased neither part. A few years later, on Easter Monday 1462, James, preaching at Brescia, uttered the opinion of some theologians that the Precious Blood shed during the Passion was not united with the Divinity of Christ during the three days of his burial. The Dominican friar, James of Brescia, the local inquisitor, immediately summoned him to his tribunal. James refused to appear, and after some troubles appealed to the Holy See. The question was discussed at Rome during Christmas 1462 (not 1463, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> it), before Pope Pius II and the cardinals, but no decision was ever given. James spent {{the last three years}} of his life in Naples, and died there on 28 November 1476.|$|E

Consequently, Gillard's move against Rudd on 23 June appeared to surprise many Labor backbenchers. Daryl Melham, when asked by a reporter {{on the night of the}} challenge if indeed a challenge was on, replied: [...] "Complete garbage. ABC have lost all credibility." [...] As he was being deposed, Rudd suggested that his opponents wanted to move Labor to the right, saying on 23 June: [...] "This party and government will not be lurching to the right on the question of asylum seekers, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> counselled us to do." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} with human habitation and cultivation. It is not an obligate commensal of humans <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> suggested: Central Asian house sparrows usually breed away from humans in open country, and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans. The only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra. Well adapted to living around humans, it frequently lives and even breeds indoors, especially in factories, warehouses, and zoos. It has been recorded breeding in an English coal mine [...] below ground, and feeding on the Empire State Building's observation deck at night. It reaches its greatest densities in urban centres, but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs, where insects are more abundant. On a larger scale, it is most abundant in wheat-growing {{areas such as the}} Midwestern United States.|$|E
500|$|Lord Carteret read {{passages}} from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for {{the identity of the}} Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an [...] "unfortunate accident" [...] and {{he did not want to}} respond in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, [...] "to provoke England to that degree <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> endeavoured to do, is not the true way to keep them out". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were [...] "ludicrous and satyrically writ". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.|$|E
500|$|Lautner {{has stated}} {{that he does not}} want to be just known for his looks, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> {{attributed}} his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill. In an interview, the actor revealed that he was originally supposed to have a baring scene in the movie Valentine's Day. He stated, [...] "The script said we were walking into school and Willy takes off his shirt. I said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out. He's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school? No, no, no. The reason I took off my shirt for New Moon is because it's written in the book that way. And there's reasons behind it." [...] Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it. In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham's satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless. In 2010, Lautner was ranked number two on Glamours [...] "50 Sexiest Men of 2010 [...] " [...] list. Men's Health ranked him at third on their list of [...] "Top 10 Summer Bodies." [...] Additionally in 2010, he was ranked fourth on Peoples [...] "Most Amazing Bodies" [...] list.|$|E

500|$|The green-head ant {{is known}} for its rarity of virgin queens, with some nests {{occasionally}} producing winged females; queens are able to establish their own colonies in captivity, but out in the wild they have never been seen to establish a colony, suggesting that the species is losing its queen caste. The majority of observations show males mating with workers, but not queens. One factor further suggesting the loss of the queen caste is that the green-head ant is going through an evolutionary process where queens are a rare morphological form with little significance, so workers usually replace the queens and take on the reproductive role. Queens still undertake the role of nuptial flight <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been seen mating with males. They are known to release a sex pheromone from the pygidial gland, an exocrine gland found between the last two abdominal segments. The ergatoid (wingless reproductive females) queens emerge from their nest and, like the workers, appress their head onto the ground and elevate their gaster, from which the intersegmental membrane {{at the back of the}} abdomen extends. The queens then release the sex pheromones, which attracts the males, who frantically search for the queens through agitated locomotion. The males may attempt to copulate with workers that did not [...] "call" [...] for them, suggesting that workers might be able to release these pheromones. When a male makes contact with a queen, the male touches her with his antennae and grasps the female's thorax with his mandibles. A queen is ready to mate when she turns her abdomen to the side, where the male will search for the genitalia with his copulatory apparatus (parts of the organ involved with copulation). The pair may copulate for several minutes.|$|E
