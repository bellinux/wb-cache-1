25|$|There is {{much debate}} {{as to whether}} the {{mechanism}} had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks.

25|$|The V8 {{engine was}} offered in larger 3.5 and 4.2-litre sizes {{as well as}} a {{supercharged}} 4.2-litre. The car's lighter weight meant the 3.0-litre V6 was also offered, although with the later introduction of the 2.7-litre V6 diesel the V6 petrol version was discontinued (neither V6 petrol nor diesel were available in US markets). A new six-speed automatic gearbox was fitted which was lighter and offered better economy with lock-up on <b>all</b> <b>gears</b> and a larger spread of ratios.|$|E
25|$|Player versus player, or PvP, {{is another}} aspect of the game. PvP in this game can be started in one of two ways: By using Sparta PvP to find a random match, or by using the arena in the capital city to play against a party member. Sparta PvP can be {{accessed}} by visiting the Sparta region in the world map. In Sparta PvP, there are two different types of PvP options. Standard PvP is the first option and allows the player to use star techs from their tech-tree as well as any gear and advisors that they have equipped in their capital city. This PvP option was first to be released. Champion mode PvP is the second Sparta PvP option. This is also sometimes known as ranked PvP while Standard PvP is known as unranked PvP. In this PvP option <b>all</b> <b>gears,</b> star techs and advisors are disabled and cannot be used to start the players off at an even footing. <b>All</b> <b>gears</b> equipped will provide the units with a cosmetic change but will not affect their stats like they would normally do in PvE missions.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in <b>all</b> <b>gears,</b> to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher battled for Montoya {{for third}} {{position}} until {{he became the}} first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 18, and rejoined the track in fourth place. The Williams and Ferrari teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Williams team were planning a one-stop strategy whereas the Ferrari team were planning for two stops. [...] Barrichello (on a lighter fuel load) was able to quickly extend his lead over Montoya to ten seconds by his first pit stop on lap 19. However, Barrichello's pit stop proved problematic: his refuelling rig failed to work which meant he was stationary for around six to seven seconds longer than planned. Barrichello exited the stop in third position, ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen lost second {{during the course of the}} 19th lap, and then lost <b>all</b> <b>gears</b> on the previous lap which forced him to retire. Verstappen retired on the 26th lap because his engine stopped working. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher moved into the lead of the race when Montoya made his pit stop on lap 28, where his pit crew made an adjustment to his front wing to rectify an issue Montoya had with oversteer, and he rejoined in third place with a deficit of 5.5 seconds. Frentzen retired from ninth position with a gearbox failure on lap 29. Villeneuve made a pit stop from sixth on lap 34 and retained the position.|$|E
2500|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. [...] The gearchange occurs with <b>all</b> <b>gears</b> stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. [...] After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|E

2500|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.

Machining {{studies were carried out}} on an <b>all</b> <b>geared</b> lathe using three different cutting tools: namely Carbide (K- 20), Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) and Poly-Crystalline Diamond (PCD). Experiments were conducted based on the established Taguchi’s Design of Experiments (DOE) L 25 orthogonal array on an <b>all</b> <b>geared</b> lathe. The cutting parameters considered were cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, and work piece (fiber orientation). The performances of the cutting tools were evaluated by measuring surface roughness (Ra) and Cutting force (Fz). A second order mathematical model in terms of cutting parameters was developed using RSM. The results indicate that the developed model is suitable for prediction of surface roughness and Cutting force in machining of GFRP composites...|$|R
