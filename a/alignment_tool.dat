25|$|BLAT (BLAST-like <b>alignment</b> <b>tool)</b> is a {{pairwise}} sequence alignment algorithm {{that was}} developed by Jim Kent at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in the early 2000s {{to assist in the}} assembly and annotation of the human genome. It was designed primarily to decrease the time needed to align millions of mouse genomic reads and expressed sequence tags against the human genome sequence. The alignment tools of the time were not capable of performing these operations in a manner that would allow a regular update of the human genome assembly. Compared to pre-existing tools, BLAT was ~500 times faster with performing mRNA/DNA alignments and ~50 times faster with protein/protein alignments.|$|E
500|$|Other {{promising}} {{methods of}} structural alignment are local structural alignment methods. These provide comparison of pre-selected parts of proteins (e.g. binding sites, user-defined structural motifs) [...] against binding sites or whole-protein structural databases. The MultiBind and MAPPIS servers [...] allow {{the identification of}} common spatial arrangements of physicochemical properties such as H-bond donor, acceptor, aliphatic, aromatic or hydrophobic {{in a set of}} user provided protein binding sites defined by interactions with small molecules (MultiBind) or in a set of user-provided protein–protein interfaces (MAPPIS). Others provide comparison of entire protein structures [...] against a number of user submitted structures or against a large database of protein structures in reasonable time (ProBiS). Unlike global alignment approaches, local structural alignment approaches are suited to detection of locally conserved patterns of functional groups, which often appear in binding sites and have significant involvement in ligand binding. As an example, comparing G-Losa, a local structure <b>alignment</b> <b>tool,</b> with TM-align, a global structure alignment based method. While G-Losa predicts drug-like ligands’ positions in single-chain protein targets more precisely than TM-align, the overall success rate of TM-align is better.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpeech-text <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> are {{frequently}} used in speech technology and research. In this paper, we propose a GPL software CoALT (Comparing Automatic Labelling Tools) for comparing two automatic labellers or two speech-text <b>alignment</b> <b>tools,</b> ranking them and displaying statistics about their differences. The main feature of CoALT {{is that a}} user can define its own criteria for evaluating and comparing the speech-text <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> since the required quality for labelling depends on the targeted application. Beyond ranking, our tool provides useful statistics for each labeller and above all about their differences and can emphasize the drawbacks and advantages of each labeller.

In this paper we present the usage of the software for comparing two automatic labellers on the corpus TIMIT.

40|$|Sequence {{alignment}} is a {{long standing}} problem in bioinformatics. The Basic Local <b>Alignment</b> Search <b>Tool</b> (BLAST) {{is one of the}} most popular and fun-damental <b>alignment</b> <b>tools.</b> The explosive growth of biological sequences calls for speedup of sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> such as BLAST. To this end, we de-velop high speed BLASTN (HS-BLASTN), a parallel and fast nucleotide database search tool that ac-celerates MegaBLAST––the default module of NCBI-BLASTN. HS-BLASTN builds a new lookup table us-ing the FMD-index of the database and employs an accurate and effective seeding method to find short stretches of identities (called seeds) between the query and the database. HS-BLASTN produces the same alignment results as MegaBLAST and its com-putational speed is much faster than MegaBLAST. Specifically, our experiments conducted on a 12 -core server show that HS-BLASTN can be 22 times faster than MegaBLAST and exhibits better parallel per-formance than MegaBLAST. HS-BLASTN is written in C++ and the related source code is available a...|$|R
50|$|Disk drives with {{exchangeable}} disk packs or disk cartridges generally {{required the}} data heads {{to be aligned}} to allow packs formatted on one drive to be read and written on another compatible drive. Alignment required a special alignment pack, an oscilloscope, an <b>alignment</b> <b>tool</b> that moved the read/write heads, and patience. The pattern generated on the scope looks like a row of alternating C and E characters on their backs. Head alignment needed to be performed after head replacement, {{and in any case}} on a periodic basis as part of the routine maintenance required by the drives.|$|E
50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences.

The camshaft pulleys were inverted by Renault making the Volvo timing marks redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist <b>alignment</b> <b>tool</b> to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|E

50|$|These are {{designed}} to cover only a restricted workspace, typically a few cubic meters, but can offer accuracy in the millimeter-range or better.

30|$|Most {{of these}} {{sequence}} <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> were very efficient and accurate until {{the introduction of}} Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS {{has led to a}} huge amount of sequencing data which has rendered many existing sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> obsolete. For example, NGS technologies like Illumina HiSeqX can easily generate nearly 6 billion sequence reads per run. After sequencing, mapping these read sequences onto a reference genome is the most important task in a sequence analysis work-flow. Alignment of such large volumes of read data onto a reference genome is a very time consuming task. Many state-of-the-art sequence aligners are developed to handle this huge amount of data efficiently but NGS platforms are evolving so rapidly that they push sequencing capacity to unprecedented levels. Therefore, sequence alignment still remains a bottleneck for bioinformaticians.|$|R
30|$|A {{large number}} of {{sequence}} <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> {{can be found in}} literature which are very efficient and powerful in mapping reads to the reference genome. With the evolution of NGS machines, the size of reads data has increased so fast that single machine based sequence aligners were unable to keep track with same. Therefore, sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> based on parallel and distributed computing architecture evolved as the best option for bioinformaticians. MapReduce [21] based platforms like Apache Hadoop [19] and Spark [20] has gained a lot of attention in recent few years as distributed computing based platforms. Many sequence aligners which use big data technologies like Apache Hadoop and Spark were implemented in last few years. CloudBurst [22], CloudAligner [23], Halvade [27], SEAL [33], BigBWA [25] and SparkBWA [26] are mostly used sequence aligners which use big data technologies.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as their}} primary {{translation}} software, SDL Language Weaver has several other products available. Their <b>Alignment</b> <b>Tool</b> is a translation memory generator. This allows users to enter previously translated documents, and align them at the segment level, producing a translation memory file. The company also has Customizer, a customization tool. This product allows users to fine-tune the translation system using small amounts (up to 2 million words) of pre-translated data in a specific subject area. This tool allows for incremental improvements over time and gives users more control of the process. However, some customer feedback indicates that while vocabulary may get better, fluency of the translation can be negatively impacted.|$|E
50|$|The {{method was}} first {{described}} by Elshire et al. (2011). In summary, {{high molecular weight}} DNAs are extracted and digested using a specific restriction enzyme (RE) previously defined by cutting frequently in the major repetitive fraction of the genome. ApeKI is the most used RE. Barcode adapters are then ligated to sticky ends and PCR amplification is performed. Next-generation sequencing technology is performed resulting in about 100 bp single-end reads. Raw sequence data are filtered and aligned to a reference genome using usually Burrows-Wheeler <b>alignment</b> <b>tool</b> (BWA) or Bowtie 2. The {{next step is to}} identify SNPs from aligned tags and score all discovered SNPs for various coverage, depth and genotypic statistics. Once a large-scale, species-wide SNP production has been run, it is possible to quickly call known SNPs in newly sequenced samples.|$|E
