5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families,*Vest. pg. 136 which he has said is motivated by his parents' divorce {{when he was a}} child.|$|E
5|$|While sculptors Eric Schilsky (1898–1974) and Hew Lorimer (1907–93) {{worked in}} the {{existing}} tradition of modelling and carving, sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world. George Wyllie (1921–2012), produced works {{of social and political}} commentary including the Straw Locomotive (1987), an event which raised questions about the decline of heavy industry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of colonialism.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and {{has rarely been}} presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E

5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|First Contact was the highest-grossing film on {{its opening}} weekend, making $92 {{million in the}} United States and Canada with an {{additional}} $54 million in other territories, combining a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it {{to be one of}} the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the Borg. First Contact was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards.|$|E
5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} situation, where the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then {{be used to determine}} if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E

Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry.

It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
