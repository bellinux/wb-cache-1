40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a multimedia informed consent (IC) presentation on the understanding and satisfaction of patients who were scheduled to receive 120 -W green-light high-performance system photoselective vaporization of the prostate (HPS-PVP). Materials and Methods: A multimedia IC (M-IC) presentation for HPS-PVP was developed. Forty men with benign prostatic hyperplasia who were scheduled to undergo HPS-PVP were prospectively randomized to a conventional written IC group (W-IC group, n= 20) or the M-IC group (n= 20). The <b>allocated</b> <b>IC</b> was obtained by one certified urologist, followed by a 15 -question test (maximum score, 15) to evaluate objective understanding, and questionnaires on subjective understanding (range, 0 ∼ 10) and satisfaction (range, 0 ∼ 10) using a visual analogue scale. Results: Demographic characteristics, including age and the highest level of education, did not significantly differ between the two groups. No significant differences were found in scores reflecting the objective understanding of HPS-PVP (9. 9 ± 2. 3 vs. 10. 6 ± 2. 8, p= 0. 332) or in subjective understanding scores (7. 5 ± 2. 1 vs. 8. 6 ± 1. 7, p= 0. 122); however, the M-IC group showed higher satisfaction scores than the W-IC group (7. 4 ± 1. 7 vs. 8. 4 ± 1. 5, p= 0. 033). After adjusting for age and educational level, the M-IC group still had significantly higher satisfaction scores. Conclusions: M-IC did not enhance the objective knowledge of patients regarding this surgical procedure. However, it improved the satisfaction of patients with the IC process itself...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) generates a high burden on health care, and hospital admissions represent a substantial {{proportion of the}} overall costs of the disease. Integrated care (IC) has shown efficacy to reduce hospitalisations in COPD patients at a pilot level. Deployment strategies for IC services require assessment of effectiveness at {{the health care system}} level. AIMS: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the effectiveness of a community-based IC service in preventing hospitalisations and emergency department (ED) visits in stable frail COPD patients. METHODS: From April to December 2005, 155 frail community-dwelling COPD patients were randomly <b>allocated</b> either to <b>IC</b> (n = 76, age 73 (8) years, forced expiratory volume during the first second, FEV 1 41 (19) % predicted) or usual care (n = 84, age 75 (9) years, FEV 1 44 (20) % predicted) and followed up for 12 months. The IC intervention consisted of the following: (a) patient’s empowerment for self-management; (b) an individualised care plan; (c) access to a call centre; and (d) coordination between the levels of care. Thereafter, hospital admissions, ED visits and mortality were monitored for 6 years. RESULTS: IC enhanced self-management (P = 0. 02), reduced anxiety–depression (P = 0. 001) and improved health-related quality of life (P = 0. 02). IC reduced both ED visits (P = 0. 02) and mortality (P = 0. 03) but not hospital admission. No differences between the two groups were seen after 6 years. CONCLUSION: The intervention improved clinical outcomes including survival and decreased the ED visits, but it did not reduce hospital admissions. The study facilitated the identification of two key requirements for adoption of IC services in the community: appropriate risk stratification of patients, and preparation of the community-based work force...|$|R
