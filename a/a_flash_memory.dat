5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>memory</b> device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{computer}} environments {{may still}} {{make use of}} floppy disks for older machines that {{do not support the}} current company networks and, in the case of laptops, where Wi-Fi is not considered secure. The floppy disk provides for a controlled means of file transfer by permitting only a few files to be transmitted. This is as USB ports on enterprise computer terminals/workstations are often disabled in order to prevent employees from using <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>memory</b> drive to take large amounts of data for unauthorized use. The capacity limit and low transfer speed of the floppy disk are advantages in this case. In addition, the loss of a floppy disk has less consequence than the loss of any modern piece of removable flash storage, and furthermore, the floppy disk, being much larger than most flash memory card formatssome of which are smaller than a fingernailis harder to lose.|$|E
25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost is that <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>memory</b> (e.g. a USB {{flash drive}} or an SSD) {{have a much}} faster seek time than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 {{enables the use of}} up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and Firewire (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.|$|E

2500|$|Released on January 11, 2005 {{during the}} Macworld expo, the first-generation iPod Shuffle weighed , and was {{designed}} to be easily loaded with a selection of songs and to play them in random order. According to Apple, owners of existing iPods had often left the music selection to [...] "shuffle", and the new iPod Shuffle was a way of implementing that in a much more cost-effective fashion. It relied on the use of an [...] "autofill" [...] feature in iTunes, which selected songs at random from a user's music library (or from a specific playlist) and copied as many as would fit into the iPod Shuffle's storage. The first generation could hold up to 240 songs (1GB model, based on Apple's estimate, of four minutes per song and 128 kbit/s AAC encoding). It used the SigmaTel STMP35xx system on a chip (SOC) and its software development kit (SDK) v2.6, <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>memory</b> IC, and USB rechargeable lithium cell. The STMP35xx SOC and its software was the most fully integrated portable MP3 playback system at release time and SigmaTel was Austin's largest IPO (2003) capturing over 60% of flash based MP3 player world market share in 2004. In 2005, peak iPod first-generation Shuffle production occurred at a hundred thousand units per day, at the Asus factory.|$|E
