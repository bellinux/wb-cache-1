40|$|Namibia has {{recently}} introduced policies regarding {{the regulation of}} agency work, and South Africa {{is in the process}} of doing the same. The promotion of the decent work agenda by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the implementation of flexicurity policies by the European Union (EU) have been followed by the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> giving recognition to agency work. This contribution revisits the approach to the regulation of agency work in Namibia and South Africa. It considers the question of whether these two cases can cast light on the changing role of labour law regulation as developments unfold on the international front.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, Spain {{has become a}} model in {{legislative}} policies for gender equality at the international level. However, the economic crisis {{has led to a}} growth in inequality, which has revealed the weaknesses of the adopted instruments. Despite the large amount of legislation in this area, the social reality has not changed at all, even experiencing a setback over the past few years. This situation was exposed in our country by a report issued in 2015 by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This report showed the negative effects of the economic crisis and austerity policies on women, even in a context necessitating increased efforts towards women’s rights. Therefore, it is imperative that the concept of gender mainstreaming and the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> of “hard law” be revisited. The goal should be to achieve gender justice based on three elements—distribution, identity, and representation—and a real parity democracy...|$|E

The high data rate systems envisaged require then very large bandwidth {{and for this reason}} the use of the Ka band for the Earth Observation Satellites has been planned. In the case of Space Exploration Systems (SES), the continuous development of payload and ground segment technologies enables the exploitation of the higher frequency bands with respect to the standard X-band baseline used in the last 30 years. The use of frequencies at the Ka band and above poses some constrains because of the high atmospheric attenuation (marginal at X band frequencies) and needs an accurate estimate of the propagation channel. In this contribution the main propagation issues related to EO and SES/DRS systems will be reviewed with a particular focus on attenuation and sky noise temperature. © 2011 EurAAP...|$|E

30|$|As for {{the second}} scenario, based on the {{perspective}} of Digital Humanities, the same evolution of the disciplinary debate on what being a humanist in the digital age means, {{has led to the}} creation of research centres for Digital Humanities (Romero-Frías & Del-Barrio-García, 2014). The framework of competences and scenarios of professional expertise are focused on activities of exploring the specific methods of digital humanities and the methodological debate (particularly ontological) on the nature of digitalized cultural heritage (Unsworth, 2013). The institutional policies are aimed at opening areas or centres to promote the development of digital humanities both from the technical (software, tools, labs), but also to cultivate the critical perspective on the methodological evolution of humanities at the cross-over with new computational methods (Klein, 2015). Therefore, the training activities would (and actually do) emphasize the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> for digitalize or to manipulate digitalized cultural heritage.

40|$|Despite the {{recognition}} of entrepreneurship {{as one of the}} main determinants of rural economic development, empirical research in this field is relatively sparse. Thus, there is little evidence on the role and function of rural entrepreneurs, {{the driving force behind the}} birth, survival and growth of rural enterprises. The present work aims at providing a contribution to filling this gap in knowledge. We present and analyse the results emerging from a questionnaire submitted to a sample of 123 rural entrepreneurs and businesses in a mountainous area of central Italy. In particular, we test for six hypotheses concerning the correlation between different factors, reflecting entrepreneur and business-specific characteristics, and the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> of institutional assistance. Entrepreneur's and business's variables are related to (1) entrepreneurial human capital; (2) entrepreneur's local knowledge and social capital; (3) firm's size; (4) entrepreneur's age; (5) firm's age; and (6) busines's sector of activity. Empirical results largely support the importance of variables taken into consideration in explaining differences in the adoption of institutional assistance among businesses of the sample. In the light of our empirical findings, we also examine and propose potential policies for fostering entrepreneurship and the development of the rural region under study...|$|E

In terms of world textile strand production, on a production per capita basis, Turkey occupies the third place in the world. Thus, the economic importance of textile industry for Turkey and its need for consolidation within the world markets is essential. Turkey imports nearly 50 % of its energy requirements.

40|$|As the citizen/customer {{role and}} their {{satisfaction}} have gradually been embracing the specific issues of New Public Management, the public administration policy makers {{have begun to}} examine instruments and models that focus on quality. The attention has therefore fallen on approaches which aim to improve the ‘internal’ effectiveness and efficiency of organisations and the ‘external’ satisfaction of the customer through typical management procedures based on Total Quality Management (TQM). In order to introduce the principles of TQM in Public Administration, the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) model has been used. CAF is a management instrument for organisations, which has been specially made to promote the culture of quality, the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> connected to TQM and the dissemination of self-assessment activities in European Union public administrations. The structure of the CAF has taken its shape and substance from the EFQM (European Foundation for Quality Management) model for excellence which, when the CAF was created, already represented a widespread, commonly used reference model by European businesses. Based on solid estimates, we can confirm that the CAF represents the EFQM model ‘translated’ for public administrations. Italy {{is one of the}} European countries where the CAF has received more significant attention and has been more widely disseminated. This paper aims to introduce the CAF model, highlighting its main structure and principles, in order to show how this may adequately meet the needs of quality coming from a public administration.

40|$|European {{governments have}} {{during the last}} couple of decades shown an {{interest}} in new types of environmental policy instruments (EPIs) such as environmental taxes, tradable permit schemes and voluntary approaches, as opposed to relying on traditional forms of regulation. The interest in so-called ‘new’ EPIs (NEPIs) has led many governments to commit both to a more diverse EPI mix and to a policy process characterised by procedural rationality, in terms of considering a wide range of alternative instruments and assessing them in a systematic and transparent way. The first aim of this thesis is to examine the success of the quest for NEPIs at the national level in the field of municipal waste policy in two countries; the UK (England) and Sweden. In addition to mapping out EPI diversity, two contrasting theories on the pattern of <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> over time are evaluated, specifically focusing on the degree of coercion associated with EPIs. It is found that the waste policy mix in England has become more diverse, while the Swedish mix is characterised by a higher degree of coercion. The second aim is to analyse whether the instrument choice process has become more procedurally rational, and, if so, conducive to the adoption of NEPIs. A range of instrument choice theories at the macro-, meso- and micro-levels drawn from the public policy and political science literature are used to explain whether the ideal of procedural rationality is achievable or not. A case study methodology is used, in which the processes leading to the landfill allowance trading scheme (LATS) in England and and the waste incineration tax in Sweden are studied. It is found that the procedural rationality was higher in the England case, but {{that it is not a}} necessary nor sufficient cause for adoption of a NEPI...|$|E
