2500|$|A {{lawsuit was}} {{brought by the}} Norlin Corporation (the parent company of Gibson) in 1977, against Elger/Hoshino U.S.A. (manufacturer and distributor, respectively, of Ibanez) over use <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> shape and logo, both {{considered}} similar to the Gibson designs. However, the suit {{was based on an}} Ibanez headstock design that had been discontinued by 1976. The case was officially closed on February 2, 1978. Those mid-1970s guitars later became known as [...] "lawsuit era" [...] guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Some acts {{have made}} their upright bass the {{centerpiece}} of their stage shows; some psychobilly musicians elaborately decorate their upright bass, such as Nekromantix frontman Kim Nekroman, whose [...] "coffinbass" [...] is {{in the shape of}} a coffin, with <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> {{in the shape of a}} cross. Nekroman created his original [...] "coffinbass" [...] from an actual child-sized coffin, and has since designed new models to achieve better acoustics, as well as collapsibility for easier transportation. Another notable act to use a coffin-shaped bass is the Brazilian psychobilly band Os Catalepticos. HorrorPops frontwoman Patricia Day also uses an elaborately painted and decorated double bass.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the best}} known guitars made by Schecter are the 'C Series' in various {{configurations}} such as the [...] "Hellraiser" [...] and [...] "Blackjack" [...] models, and the 'S Series', which included the [...] "S-1 Elite" [...] (double cut) guitars, which held some visual similarity to Gibson's Les Paul Double Cut and double cut Melody Maker — and the [...] "S-1" [...] (a less fancy version of the S-1 Elite). The 'Elite' versions of Schecter's mass-produced instruments often include an arched top, abalone binding, a bound fretboard and a bound headstock with <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> finish matched with that of the guitar body. Despite all the visually impressive dressing these instruments remained quite affordable and the quality standard did not suffer. Pickups on many of the mass-produced Schecter models are almost always 'Duncan Designed' humbuckers (double coil pickups based on Seymour Duncan's pickup specifications), usually with a 'push-pull' coil splitter control that allows the full humbucker pickup sound to be 'split' into the sharper tone characteristic of single coil pickups.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 Rickenbacker {{developed}} an electric twelve-string guitar with <b>an</b> innovative <b>headstock</b> design that enabled all twelve machine heads to be fitted onto <b>a</b> standard-length <b>headstock</b> by alternately mounting pairs of machine heads at right-angles to the other.|$|R
50|$|JB-5: Same as the JB, but a 5-string with <b>a</b> 4+1 <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
50|$|L-1005: Very {{short run}} of a 5 string L-1000, with <b>a</b> 3+2 <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|S-series which {{featured}} the only Steinberger with <b>a</b> <b>headstock.</b> Very rare with about 300-350 built. The guitar featured Ned Steinberger's 40:1 gearless tuners.|$|E
50|$|The Coronado also {{featured}} relatively thin 'C'-shaped bolt-on maple neck, {{topped with a}} rosewood fingerboard, and <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> shaped similarly {{to that of a}} Fender Stratocaster.|$|E
50|$|The bells {{are mounted}} within a bellframe of steel or wood and each bell is {{suspended}} from <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> fitted to bearings {{so that the}} bell may rotate.|$|E
50|$|MJ-5: Same as the MJ-4, {{but with}} 5 strings on <b>a</b> 3+2 <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of a [...] "matched headstock" [...] varies between manufacturers and players - for example, the headstocks of Gibson guitars are nearly always black, and it is debatable whether a black-bodied Gibson has <b>a</b> matching <b>headstock.</b> Generally, <b>a</b> guitar is only considered to have <b>a</b> matching <b>headstock</b> if the guitar is usually produced without matching body and headstock finishes.|$|R
5000|$|Black w/ Gloss Black Stripes (There are 2 {{of these}} guitars, one with <b>a</b> {{matching}} Black <b>headstock</b> {{and one with}} <b>a</b> natural <b>headstock.</b> One is seen with orange paint splatter on the body, and the other now has [...] "AVA" [...] spray painted on the body.) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>headstock</b> or peghead {{is part of}} {{a guitar}} or similar {{stringed}} instrument such as a lute, mandolin, banjo, ukulele and others of the lute lineage. The main function of <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> is to house the pegs or mechanism that holds the strings at the [...] "head" [...] of the instrument. At the [...] "tail" [...] of the instrument the strings are usually held by a tailpiece or bridge. Machine heads on the headstock are commonly used to tune the instrument by adjusting the tension of strings and, consequentially, the pitch of sound they produce.|$|E
5000|$|... chha-thâu tshia-thâu (車頭): chauffeur (literally, [...] "car head", but used in China {{to refer}} to <b>a</b> <b>headstock).</b> Its {{equivalent}} in the Standard Xiamen dialect is [...] "chhia-hu tshia-hu" [...] （車夫）.|$|E
50|$|Pickguards come {{in various}} designs and shapes but {{designers}} usually try to match <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> and pickguard design. Both {{can be used}} to incorporate logos, branding and/or elements of the manufacturer's/customer's style.|$|E
50|$|L-2500: 5 string {{adaptation}} of the L-2000. Earlier versions have <b>a</b> 4+1 <b>headstock</b> configuration. Most are 3+2.|$|R
5000|$|... {{one based}} on ES-335, other similar to Kessel model with {{diamond-shaped}} sound holes and <b>a</b> single-side <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Designed by Joey Rico in 1983, the Ironbird {{gained some}} {{popularity}} amongst heavy metal guitarists, including Trey Azagthoth of Morbid Angel. The original model had <b>a</b> pointed reverse <b>headstock,</b> whereas the 21st Century version has <b>a</b> regular pointed <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Non-Reverse Firebird - Collectors' {{term for}} a Firebird I, III, V or VII {{featuring}} <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> with the tuners on the bass side, and a body having the bass side horn slightly longer than the treble side horn.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the Choinori SS was introduced. Mechanically {{the same}} as the regular Choinori, the SS had the leg shield {{replaced}} by <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> cover, a different style of handlebar was used, and the turn signals were moved to the handlebars.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from its}} main function, the {{headstock}} {{is an important}} decorative detail of a guitar. It {{is the place where}} overwhelming majority of guitar manufacturers draw their logo. Some guitars without machine heads (for example, ones equipped with Floyd Rose SpeedLoader) have <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> for purely decorative reasons.|$|E
50|$|JS32R: The JS32R has a {{compound}} radius neck with 24 frets. Floyd Rose Licensed Bridge, two Humbuckers by Jackson and <b>a</b> reversed <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The body {{is made of}} Alder for {{the black}} finish version. The guitar also {{features}} <b>a</b> reverse <b>headstock,</b> {{as well as two}} EMG 81-7 active pickups.|$|R
50|$|The Starcaster has <b>a</b> unique <b>headstock</b> design, with <b>a</b> black bottom curve. No other {{production}} Fender guitar {{before or since}} had the same headstock, but some prototypes of the Fender Marauder, also designed by Fields, had <b>a</b> similar <b>headstock</b> design. It was also unusual for a semi-hollow guitar in having an asymmetrical ("offset") body, a maple fretboard, a bolt-on neck, a novel control configuration consisting of a volume and tone control for each pickup {{as well as a}} master volume control, and Fender's traditional six-on-a-side tuning pegs.|$|R
5000|$|The gauge {{consists}} of a beam, <b>a</b> <b>headstock,</b> and a scribing or marking implement, typically a pin, knife, pen or wheel. The headstock slides along the beam, and is locked in place by various means: a locking screw, cam lever, or a wedge. The marking implement is fixed to {{one end of the}} beam.|$|E
5000|$|The Marauder {{sports a}} {{contoured}} single cutaway Les Paul-shaped body, and a bolt on maple neck with <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> {{similar to the}} Flying V's. Marauders were made with alder, maple, or mahogany bodies. The fretboard was produced both in the traditional Gibson rosewood, or the more Fender-like maple, with twenty-two frets. Most had dot markers, [...] "though some may have had trapezoid." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} lathes can vary greatly {{depending}} on the intended application; however, basic features are common to most types. These machines consist of (at the least) <b>a</b> <b>headstock,</b> bed, carriage, and tailstock. Better machines are solidly constructed with broad bearing surfaces (slide-ways) for stability, and manufactured with great precision. This helps ensure the components manufactured on the machines can meet the required tolerances and repeatability.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 Washburn {{discontinued}} the Stealth guitars because Dimebag {{had gone}} back to Dean. Dean now makes Stealth which have a smaller body and <b>a</b> Razorback <b>headstock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{dark blue}} Jackson Dinky with <b>a</b> Reverse <b>Headstock</b> and Tune-O-Matic style fixed bridge (as {{opposed to the}} far more common Floyd Rose tremolo system), 2005 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} G# has {{the same}} body shape and size as the standard, but a wider neck, nylon strings, and also <b>a</b> slotted <b>headstock</b> like most classical guitars.|$|R
50|$|The bell is {{attached}} to <b>a</b> <b>headstock,</b> historically made of wood but now more often steel. This has to withstand the dynamic force of the bell as it swings, up to three times its static weight. At {{each end of the}} headstock are protruding trunnions or bearing pins which are located in bearings attached to the frame. The frame itself is rigidly attached to the fabric of the tower.|$|E

5000|$|The guitarra morisca or mandora medieval is a plucked string instrument. It is a lute {{that has}} a bulging belly and <b>a</b> <b>headstock</b> as sickle. Part of that {{characterization}} came from a c. 1330 poem, Libra de Buen Amor by Juan Ruiz, which described the [...] "Moorish gittern" [...] as [...] "corpulent". The use of the adjective morisca tacked to guitarra may have been to differentiate it from the commonly seen Latin European variety, when the morisca was seen on a limited basis during the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|In June 1957, Fender {{announced}} a redesign of the Precision Bass. The remake included <b>a</b> larger <b>headstock,</b> <b>a</b> new pickguard design, a bridge with four steel saddles {{that could be}} individually adjusted and a new split single-coil pickup. This {{proved to be the}} final version of the instrument, which has changed little since then. In 1960, rosewood fingerboards, wider color selections and a three-ply pickguard became available for the P-Bass.|$|R
5000|$|Fender Custom Shop Telecaster 12 - string - Replaced his Burns on the ...Like Clockwork tour, {{finished}} in [...] "Copper Relic" [...] with <b>a</b> matching <b>headstock</b> and tort pickguard.|$|R
50|$|The Ibanez Iceman II {{that was}} {{released}} in 1982/1983 had <b>a</b> different <b>headstock</b> with 6 in line tuners instead of the 3 a side tuners the original Ibanez Iceman had.|$|R
