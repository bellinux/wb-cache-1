When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an <b>African-American</b> <b>woman,</b> Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{intellectual}} and scholarly basis of the struggle for social integration of <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> into American society.

A distinct contribution of this paper to the current scholarship is a proposed framework for a process of social integration of <b>African-American</b> <b>women,</b> one which draws on the works and experiences of <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> in general, and those in academe in particular.

50|$|Despite {{the passage}} of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, <b>African-American</b> <b>women,</b> {{particularly}} those inhabiting Southern states, still faced a number of issues. At first, <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> in the North were easily able to register to vote, and quite a few became actively involved in politics. One such woman was Annie Simms Banks who was chosen to serve as a delegate to Kentucky’s Republican Party in March 1920. White southerners took notice of African-American female activists organizing themselves for suffrage, and after {{the passage of}} the Nineteenth Amendment, African-American women's voter registration in Florida was higher than white women's. Because of white people's fears about them wielding political power, <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> found themselves targeted by a number of disenfranchisement methods. These included having to wait in line for up to twelve hours to register to vote, pay head taxes, and undergo new tests. One of the new tests required that <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> read and interpret the Constitution before being deemed eligible to vote. In the South, <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> faced even more severe obstacles to voting. These obstacles included bodily harm and fabricated charges designed to land them in jail if they attempted to vote.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the investigation of cardiovascular disease in <b>women,</b> although <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> have received little attention. This study compares characteristics and outcomes in women admitted to coronary care units for suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI). Between January 1988 and December 1991, a total of 554 (5 %) African-American and 9738 (95 %) white women with suspected acute MI were admitted to coronary care units in metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Relevant demographic socioeconomic, clinical, and outcome data were abstracted from the medical record and entered in the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention registry. <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> were younger, more often single and unemployed, and were less likely to have health insurance than their white counterparts. In addition, a higher proportion of <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> reported a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. After adjustment for age, <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> were equally as likely to develop acute MI and were more likely to die in the hospital.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} women with characteristics of Africana Womanism and hypertension (high blood pressure). An analysis was performed {{using data from the}} National Survey of Black Americans to determine the association between women with characteristics of Africana Womanism and hypertension. Data analysis consisted of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. An analysis of the data revealed that characteristics of Africana Womanism serve as a protective factor for hypertension in <b>African-American</b> <b>women.</b> The association between women with characteristics of Africana Womanism and hypertension when adjusting for age indicates that women with characteristics of Africana Womanism were 0. 56 times as likely to have hypertension. <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> have one of the highest rates of hypertension in the United States. The intersection of gender, race, and class has a direct impact on the health of <b>African-American</b> <b>women.</b> Cultural theoretical frameworks are critical for understanding the complex interaction of gender, class, and race on the prevalence of hypertension in <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> and for eliminating the disparity in cardiovascular health outcomes experienced by <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> as compared to white women. Adopting a theory such as Africana Womanism provides the necessary framework from which <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> understand their lived experiences. It allows them the opportunity to operate from a positive cultural framework on a daily basis. Operating from this framework decreases the amount of stress and conflict that arises when <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> operate from alien constructs such as feminism. Thus, by reducing the amount of stress and conflict, there should be a reduction in diseases-physical and mental. Africana Womanism offers internal resources that provide invaluable coping strategies for <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> to fight the twin barrels of racism and sexism that they experience in the United States...|$|R
