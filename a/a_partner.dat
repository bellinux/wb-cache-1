2500|$|While {{gender is}} not a {{reliable}} predictor of how any individual will react to sexual and emotional infidelity, there are nonetheless differences in how {{men and women on}} average react to sexual and emotional infidelity. [...] Culturally Western men, relative to culturally Western women, find it more difficult to forgive <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> sexual infidelity than <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> emotional infidelity. [...] Western men {{are also more likely to}} break up in response to <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> sexual infidelity than in response to <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> emotional infidelity. [...] Conversely, Western women on average find it more difficult to forgive <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> emotional infidelity than <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> sexual infidelity, and are more likely to end a relationship in response to <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> emotional infidelity. [...] A possible explanation for these differences has been proposed by evolutionary psychologists: over human evolution, <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> sexual infidelity placed men, but not women, at risk of investing resources in a rival's offspring. [...] Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> sexual infidelity represents a potentially more costly adaptive problem for men than women. [...] As such, modern men have psychological mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> sexual infidelity.|$|R

40|$|Young men {{are more}} distressed by <b>a</b> <b>partner’s</b> sexual infidelity, whereas young wo{{men are more}} distressed by <b>a</b> <b>partner’s</b> {{emotional}} infidelity. The present research investigated (a) whether the sex difference in jealousy replicates in an older sample, and (b) whether younger people differ from older people in their selection of the more distressing infidelity scenario. We presented forced-choice dilemmas to 202 older people (mean age = 67 years) and to 234 younger people (mean age = 20 years). The sex difference replicated in the older sample. In addition, older women were less likely than younger women to select <b>a</b> <b>partner’s</b> emotional infidelity as more distressing than <b>a</b> <b>partner’s</b> sexual infidelity. Discussion offers directions for future work on sex differences and age differences in jealousy. KEY WORDS: Age differences; Evolutionary psychology; Romantic jealousy...|$|R
