Increasing δ 15 N values after c. 4000 cal.

40|$|Heterotrophic {{bacteria}} play a {{key role}} in the degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and carbon cycling in river sediments. These bacterial communities are directly influenced by environmental variables that differ spatially and temporally in rivers. Here, we studied the longitudinal patterns of sediment bacterial community composition and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> utilization under base flow and drought conditions in a Mediterranean river. Our results indicated that sediment microbial communities were affected by dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> quality and origin along the river continuum. In headwaters the potential degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose was greater (i. e., higher β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase activities), suggesting higher microbial utilization of allochthonous detritus from terrestrial origin. Conversely, the accumulation and transport of more recalcitrant compounds (i. e., decrease in the recalcitrant index) became potentially relevant downstream. Furthermore, discharge fluctuations had clear effects on bacterial community composition and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> use. The hydrological fragmentation of the river continuum during drought period generated sediment microhabitats dominated by gamma and delta-Proteobacteria, with a greater potential capacity to degrade a wide range of compounds, particularly nitrogen containing moieties. During base flow conditions, we observed a higher occurrence of alpha-Proteobacteria and a greater potential use of more recalcitrant carbon compounds, mostly of terrestrial origin. Overall, our findings suggest an upstream-downstream longitudinal transition of sediment microbial communities that rely on allochthonous to <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and a shift toward <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> reliance during droughtThis study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through projects FLUMED-HOTSPOTS (CGL 2011 - 30151 -C 02) and FUNSTREAM (CGL 2014 - 58760 -C 3 -R...|$|R

However, the impact of land management intensity on soil microbial diversity (i. e. richness and evenness) and consequences for functioning is still poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by coupling molecular characterization of microbial diversity with measurements of carbon (C) mineralization in soils obtained from three locations across Europe, each representing a gradient of land management intensity under different soil and environmental conditions. Bacterial and fungal diversity were characterized by high throughput sequencing of ribosomal genes. Carbon cycling activities (i. e., mineralization of <b>autochthonous</b> soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> mineralization of allochthonous plant residues) were measured by quantifying 12 C- and 13 C-CO 2 release after soils had been amended, or not, with 13 C-labelled wheat residues. Variation partitioning {{analysis was used to}} rank biological and physicochemical soil parameters according to their relative contribution to these activities. Across all three locations, microbial diversity was greatest at intermediate levels of land use intensity, indicating that optimal management of soil microbial diversity might not be achieved under the least intensive agriculture. Microbial richness was the best predictor of the C-cycling activities, with bacterial and fungal richness explaining 32. 2 and 17 % of the intensity of <b>autochthonous</b> soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> mineralization; and fungal richness explaining 77 % of the intensity of wheat residues mineralization.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all 68 amplicons belonged to the Labyrinthulea. Only 15 of the 68 amplicons belonged to the thraustochytrid phylogenetic group (Thraustochytriidae). None of these 15 were similar to cultivated strains, and 11 formed a novel group.

Fatty acid signature and stable isotope data have revealed that terrestrial organic matter (including terrestrial vascular plants), bacteria, phytoplankton produced within the estuary and coastal sea, green macroalgae and mixed planktonic-sources predominantly contributed to the organic matter pool in the estuary. The combined approach has also allowed for the prediction of the following mixing regime and distribution of organic matter sources along the estuarine salinity gradient; Allochthonous, both terrestrial and river-borne organic matter which dominate the riverine section of the estuary seem to be slightly diluted with <b>autochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the middle estuary (site M) and thereafter, in the lower reaches of the estuary (Site SW 2) are measurably admixed with tidally introduced marine organic matter.

Three fractions of trace metals (total, dissolved and labile fractions) were sampled during dry weather and analyzed. During dry weather, few labile metals, potentially bioavailable, were present in the pond (less than 50 % of the total concentration), less than in the river (40 - 70 %). The chlorophyll a concentration was higher in the pond (90 to 140 mu g/L) than in the river (30 mu g/L) : <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> seems to favour the complexation of dissolved metals.

Using this correction factor, it was found that sediment bacterial biomass in 22 lakes was positively related to an indicator of the rate of allochthonous organic matter input to lakes. However, the total hypolimnetic carbon mineralization rate of lakes, which integrates both sediment and hypolimnetic water column mineralization, was found to be driven mainly by phytoplankton carbon and to occur mainly in the hypolimnetic water column.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{terrestrial}} particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (t-POM) entering lakes {{is predicted to}} increase {{as a result of}} climate change. This may especially alter the structure and functioning of ecosystems in small, shallow lakes which can rapidly shift from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated into a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. We used the integrative ecosystem model PCLake to predict how rising t-POM inputs affect the resilience of the clear-water state. PCLake links a pelagic and benthic food chain with abiotic components by a number of direct and indirect effects. We focused on three pathways (zoobenthos, zooplankton, light availability) by which elevated t-POM inputs (with and without additional nutrients) may modify the critical nutrient loading thresholds at which a clear-water lake becomes turbid and vice versa. Our model results show that (1) increased zoobenthos biomass due to the enhanced food availability results in more benthivorous fish which reduce light availability due to bioturbation, (2) zooplankton biomass does not change, but suspended t-POM reduces the consumption of <b>autochthonous</b> particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> which increases the turbidity, and (3) the suspended t-POM reduces the light availability for submerged macrophytes. Therefore, light availability is the key process that is indirectly or directly changed by t-POM input. This strikingly resembles the deteriorating effect of terrestrial dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> on the light climate of lakes. In all scenarios, the resilience of the clear-water state is reduced thus making the turbid state more likely at a given nutrient loading. Therefore, our study suggests that rising t-POM input can add to the effects of climate warming making reductions in nutrient loadings even more urgent. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim. It {{is hardly}} {{possible}} {{to predict the}} continued stability of the watercourse ecosystems without the study of biological characteristics and composition of organisms inhabiting them. In the last 35 - 40 years, environmental conditions of the Mingachevir reservoir {{are determined by the}} stationary anthropogenic pressure. It was found that such components of plankton as algae, bacteria and fungi play {{a leading role in the}} transformation and migration of pollutants. The role of the three groups of organisms is very important in maintaining the water quality by elimination of pollutants. Among the organisms inhabiting the Mingachevir Reservoir, micromycetes have not yet been studied.  Therefore, the study of the species composition and seasonal dynamics, peculiarities of their growth and development in the environment with the presence of some of the pollutants should be considered to date. Methods. In order to determine the role of micromycetes-migrants in the mineralization of organic substrates, as an active participant of self-purification process, we used water samples from the bottom sediments as well as decaying and skeletonized stalks of cane, reeds, algae, macrophytes, exuvia of insects and fish remains submerged in water. Findings. For the first time, we obtained the data on the quality and quantity of microscopic mycelial fungi in freshwater bodies on the example of the Mingachevir water reservoir; we also studied the possibilities for oxygenating the <b>autochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of allochthonous origin with micromycetes-migrants. Conclusions. It was found that the seasonal development of micromycetes-migrants within the Mingachevir reservoir is characterized by an increase in the number of species in the summer and a gradual reduction in species diversity in the fall.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Total {{organic carbon}} (TOC), total sulfur (S) and Rock-Eval {{pyrolysis}} analyzes were performed in 41 samples collected along the SP- 60 -PR core, from the Irati Formation, northwestern of Paraná Basin. This work aims {{to show how}} organic matter content evolved vertically in the Irati Formation and therefore {{to contribute to the}} identification of the most attractive levels to generate hydrocarbons, in thermally immature sediments. The results of these analyses allowed to recognize sharp changes in the types of organic matter and paleoenvironmental conditions, giving rise to eight chemical-stratigraphic units, labeled as A, B and C (Taquaral Member) and D, E, F, G and H (Assistência Member). The units A and C display low organic carbon content and predominance of organic matter type IV, which indicate an oxic environment. The unit B, with higher TOC content, has organic matter predominantly of type II and should be associated to a disoxic environment. The Assistência Member, mainly with organic matter type II, is differentiated from the previous units by their sharply higher TOC content and hydrogen index values, suggesting a more restricted environment, characterized by disoxic to anoxic conditions. The bituminous shale of the units E and H have the highest TOC, sulfur and hydrogen index values, representing the units where conditions of the <b>autochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (type II) preservation was more efficient (anoxic environment). Despite being found organic matter thermally immature in the Assistência Member, the layer with the highest generation potential is the unity H. The comparison with data of other studied wells evidenced a strong reduction in the potential generator of the Irati Formation toward the north of Paraná Basin. ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{perturbations}} in wetlands {{affect the}} integrated plant-microbial-soil system, causing biogeochemical responses that can manifest at local to global scales. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine how saltwater intrusion affects carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas production in coastal wetlands. Working with tidal freshwater marsh soils that had experienced ~ 3. 5 yr of in situ saltwater additions, we quantified changes in soil properties, measured extracellular enzyme activity associated with organic matter breakdown, and determined potential rates of anaerobic carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) production. Soils from the field plots treated with brackish water had lower carbon content and higher C : N ratios than soils from freshwater plots, indicating that saltwater intrusion reduced carbon availability and increased organic matter recalcitrance. This was reflected in reduced activities of enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of cellulose and the oxidation of lignin, leading to reduced rates of soil CO 2 and CH 4 production. The effects of long-term saltwater additions contrasted with the effects of short-term exposure to brackish water during three-day laboratory incubations, which increased rates of CO 2 production but lowered rates of CH 4 production. Collectively, our data suggest that the long-term effect of saltwater intrusion on soil CO 2 production is indirect, mediated through the effects of elevated salinity on the quantity and quality of <b>autochthonous</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> inputs to the soil. In contrast, salinity, organic matter content, and enzyme activities directly influence CH 4 production. Our analyses demonstrate that saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater marshes affects the entire process of carbon mineralization, from the availability of organic carbon through its terminal metabolism to CO 2 and/or CH 4, and illustrate that long-term shifts in biogeochemical functioning are not necessarily consistent with short-term disturbance-type responses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMangrove sediments are an {{important}} <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM) reservoir and {{play a major role}} in the carbon cycle. Since the 1990 s, these ecosystems were subjected to numerous studies, in order to quantify the sed-imentary sink for organic carbon (OC) and to characterize the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> sources, but remain poorly studied in Western Africa. The aim of our study is to quantify the organic carbon content and to identify the OM origin stored in the Somone mangrove sediments. Studied area is characterized by a (i) dry climate conditions with a higher rate of evaporation, (ii) lack of freshwater input by river, and (iii) tide dominated system. Here, we focus on physico-chemical properties of sediments (temperature, pH and redox), sedi-ment grain size, water content, particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon from a series of 40 cm-deep cores in four tidal contexts: mudflat, Rhizophora, and Avicennia mangroves and barren area. Results show that total organic carbon (TOC) contents range between 0. 34 and 3. 92 wt. % and are higher in sediments from mudflat and Rhizophora mangrove than in sediments from Avicennia mangrove and barren area. Indeed, sediments stored under Avicennia is subjected to suboxic conditions initiated by roots system and crabs bioturbation; while under Rhizophora and mudflat, local anoxic conditions are prevalent as suggest the negative Eh values and the occurrence of framboidal pyrites. Mangrove sediments of the Somone estuary contain an <b>autochthonous</b> lignocellulosic-derived <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The youngest and stunted form of the Somone mangrove explains the low organic carbon content of sediments; where dry climate conditions limit the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> production by the mangrove forest. The shallow depth at which the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of the former mudflat was found confirms that the Somone mangrove is subjected to a low sedimentation rate. This suggests that organic carbon burial depends on others processes than sedimentation. Then, in the Somone mangrove ecosystem, both of pneumatophores and burrowing crab activities are the main factors that control OM degradation (Avicennia station) while anaerobic conditions (mudflat and Rhizophora) promote OM preservation...|$|R
40|$|Litter {{dynamics}} and outwelling of particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (POM) {{was investigated in}} a subtropical mangrove (Okinawa Island, South Japan) in order to quantify the impact of mangrove POM on adjacent intertidal sediments. A distinct seasonal pattern was found with maximum litter fall during the autumn season, and minimum during winter. Total litter production between sites did not differ significantly. Tall mangroves (average 7 m) did not show any higher contribution to the litter production than short mangroves (average 4 m). The mean annual litter production was 12. 95 ᠲ. 95 t ha- 1 (dry weight) with leaf fall contributing more than 70 % of the total litter production. Analysis of fatty acids (FAs) in the surface sediments of an adjacent mud flat and sand flat during the winter, spring and autumn seasons indicated that outwelling of POM from the mangrove ecosystem occurs. However, it is spatially restricted to within 300 m from the mangrove forest. The magnitude of the outwelling increased during spring and autumn consistent {{with the increase in}} the total litter production. Despite the presence of mangrove-derived <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the estuarine surface sediments, <b>autochthonous</b> sources of <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> green macroalgae (Ulva pertusa and Enteromorpha intestinalis), diatoms and bacteria are the main contributors of sedimentary <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and ? 3 and ? 6 PUFAs than mangrove-derived (POM) during winter and spring.

40|$|Abstract Photolysis is an {{important}} attenuation pathway {{for the removal of}} wastewater effluent organic micropollutants from surface waters. In this work, direct and indirect processes leading to the degradation of the disinfectant, triclocarban were studied. Photo-irradiation experiments were conducted in water collected from Old Woman Creek (OWC) a tributary of Lake Erie near Huron, OH, USA and in solutions of fulvic acids isolated from the Suwannee River, Georgia, USA (SRFA), Old Woman Creek (OWCFA) and Pony Lake, Antarctica (PLFA). Photodegradation of triclocarban proceeded faster in the presence of all three fulvic acids relative to deionized water. PLFA, an <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (DOM) was found to be more reactive than the other fulvic acids, while the mostly allochthonous SRFA exhibited the lowest reactivity toward triclocarban. The later observation can be in part explained by anti-oxidant moieties present in SRFA. Photosensitized triclocarban degradation in whole water DOM from OWC was entirely attributable to the fulvic acid fraction and suggests that this component is the most photo-reactive fraction of the DOM. Anoxic and methanol-quenched experiments revealed unexpected results whereby the former suggests oxidation through reaction with triplet DOM, while the later is indicative of reaction with photo-generated hydroxyl radicals. It is possible that methanol can quench excited DOM species, which would shut down the triplet oxidation pathway. Finally, we observed no enhancement of triclocarban-photosensitized degradation through the addition of iron...|$|R
