40|$|There is {{a strong}} demand for {{flexible}} user interface technology with a desired size and shape to make real world objects touch-interactive. In this regard, plastic based <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> {{have been widely used}} on account of their adaptability. However, their fabrication involves eco-unfriendly procedures like lithography or other cleanroom processes which contribute greenhouse gases (GHG) and hence raises the need for exploring alternative green fabrication methods. In this work, we report the fabrication of an inexpensive, flexible, biocompatible, low power and environmentally benign interdigitated capacitive (IDC) <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> based on cleanroom-free and solvent-free processing of graphite on paper (GOP). The performance of touchpad with four <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> keys was evaluated by integrating it with Arduino UNO development board and it functioned similar to the conventional touchpads which are fabricated by utilizing complex procedures and expensive equipments on plastic substrates. The influence of the number and the overlap length of electrode digits on <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> performance was investigated and optimized based on variation in capacitance with the interaction of finger with the <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> for better performance and enhanced user experience. The pressure due to strength of the touch and strain induced due to bending and folding of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> resulted in insignificant variation in capacitance and no change in functionality. This suggests that the flexible and robust GOP based touchpad can be used in diverse applications such as user interface for medical diagnostics, health, environment and security monitoring devices where low cost, eco-friendly, flexible, durable and stable touch control is required. This approach of developing highly advanced, efficient yet biodegradable paper electronics which doesn’t involve the use of any toxic, flammable or corrosive gases nor chemicals paves the way for next generation green and sustainable eco-friendly electronics...|$|R

40|$|We {{can touch}} things, and our senses tell us when our hands are {{touching}} something. But most computer input devices cannot detect when the user touches or releases the device or {{some portion of}} the device. Thus, adding <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> to computer input devices offers many possibilities for novel input devices and interaction techniques. We demonstrate two new devices, the TouchTrackball and the Scrolling TouchMouse, which use unobtrusive capacitance sensors to detect contact from the user's hand without requiring pressure or mechanical actuation of a switch. We further demonstrate how the capabilities of these devices can be matched to an implicit interaction technique, the OnDemand Interface, which uses the passive information captured by <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> to fade in or fade out portions of a display depending on what the user is doing; a second technique uses explicit, intentional interaction with <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> for enhanced scrolling.

40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a finger taps {{acceleration}} measurement system for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The system was composed of two 3 -axis piezoelectric element accelerometers, a pair of <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> made of thin stainless steel sheets, an analog-digital (AD) converter and a personal computer (PC). Fingerstalls, with these sensors, were attached to subject’s index finger and thumb. The acceleration and output of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> were recorded using the PC during the finger taps movements. Intervals between the single finger taps movements were calculated from the measured output of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensors.</b> Velocities during the single finger taps movements were calculated by integrating the measured acceleration. The amplitudes were calculated by integrating the velocities. The standard deviation of the single finger taps intervals, average of maximum single finger taps velocities and average of maximum single finger taps amplitudes were calculated from them. They were used as features for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The developed system was used to conduct finger taps tests employing 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson’s diseases subjects. The subjects were asked to execute continuous finger taps movement for 60 s. It was shown that the acceleration and output of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> could be measured and the features could be extracted. P I...|$|R
