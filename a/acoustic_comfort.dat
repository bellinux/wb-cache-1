The results presented here {{are part of}} a study that investigates the behaviour of acoustically constituted worship parameters in six Catholic churches (Goa, India). <b>Acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is quantified through an <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression Index which measures the net comfort induced through the optimization of the desired subjective acoustic impressions for different types of music and different music sources. Silence Factor is constituted through the normalization of equivalent noise level (LAeq) and the subjective acoustic impressions of background noise and echoes. Regression analyses of the derived acoustic parameters generate significant results. Acoustically, the Silence Factor quadratically decays with LAeq and the <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression Index is predicted as a multiregression on the subjective acoustic impressions of balance and clarity. Architecturally, the Silence Factor linearly grows with the width of the nave (of the church) whereas, the <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Comfort</b> Impression Index does not significantly relate with any of the tested architectural parameters.

In this paper, first, we propose to synthetize such aeroacoustic wall pressure field based on Cholesky decomposition. Using analytical expressions of the Cross Power Spectral Density of an acoustic diffuse field and of a turbulent flow (Corcos model), spatial distributions of turbulent and acoustic excitations are determined in term of amplitude and phase in the frequency domain. Then, as a second step, the vibroacoustic behavior of a simply-supported plate excited by these synthetized fields is computed thanks to FEM calculations (ACTRAN software). The radiated field is then successively estimated for the acoustic excitation, the turbulent one and for both aeroacoustic excitations. The effect of flow inhomogeneity on the radiation field has been also regarded. Finally, a statistical analysis between radiated field and excitation fields is performed thanks to the coherence function analysis. It is then confirmed that such analysis presents some limits especially when dealing with uncorrelated sources of noise...|$|R
40|$|The sound {{environment}} and acoustic perception of open-air markets, {{which are very}} common in high-density urban open spaces, play important roles {{in terms of the}} urban soundscape. Based on objective and subjective measurements of a typical temporary open-air market in Harbin city, China, the effects of the temporary open-air market on the sound {{environment and}} acoustic perception were studied, considering different crowd densities. It was observed that a temporary open-air market without zoning increases the sound pressure level and subjective loudness by 2. 4 dBA and 0. 21 dBA, respectively, compared to the absence of a temporary market. Different from the sound pressure level and subjective loudness, the relationship between crowd density and the perceived <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is parabolic.

Meanwhile, evaluation of <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> evaluation is influenced by income, education level, and occupation, with correlation coefficients or contingency coefficients of 0. 10 to 0. 60 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01). The effect of gender and age on evaluation of subjective loudness and <b>acoustic</b> <b>comfort</b> is statistically insignificant. The effects of occupation are mainly caused by the differences in income and education level, in which the effects of income are greater than that of education level.

Applying the concept of route-based tourism to guide tourists rambling along cultural and heritage routes can relieve overcrowded condition at hot scenic spots and increase the overall carrying capacity of the city.

In order to study the source mechanisms responsible for aircraft cabin noise, an extensive flight test campaign was carried out that considered multiple flight and operational conditions of the aircraft. For the global analysis of this problem, structure-borne noise as well as airborne sound sources must be considered. Hence, an extensive data set was collected that consists of vibration measurements of the fuselage primary structure and cabin interior, unsteady surface-pressure for characterization of the turbulent boundary layer, engine induced external sound pressure and sound pressure inside the cabin. In total, 154 vibration signals, 38 unsteady pressure signals, 80 external microphones and 66 internal microphones {{have been used in}} more than 300 different flight conditions. In the current paper, the main focus is given to the medium frequency range and in particular to the vibration analysis since the acceleration of the fuselage acts as an intermediate element between sources and receivers.

Results show consistency of the expected relation between dynamic pressure and vibro-acoustic responses for such problem.
