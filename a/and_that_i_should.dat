500|$|Stefanie {{stated in}} later {{interviews}} {{that she was}} unaware of Hitler at the time, but that she had received an anonymous love letter asking her {{to wait for him}} to graduate and then to marry him, which she only realised after being questioned about him, must have been from Hitler. She recalled: [...] "I once received a letter from someone who said they were to attend the Academy of Arts, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> wait for him; he could come back and marry me! I had no idea who the letter might have been from or who I should have send it to." ...|$|E
500|$|The Akron Community Foundation {{established}} a Dante Lavelli Scholarship Fund in 2010 to help Hudson High athletes pay for college. [...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her. I really got to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E
2500|$|The {{messenger}} {{who visited}} {{us on this}} occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted {{under the direction of}} Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. ...|$|E
2500|$|No cricket {{had come}} from Swabi before and Junaid Khan didn't take {{interest}} in cricket initially, he played with tape-ball & was introduced to hard ball set up by his cousin. At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates suggested that I should go for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards I was relieved that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted {{me and told me}} that I had potential <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go to Lahore".|$|E

2500|$|... {{official}} {{assurance that}} whatever measures {{might be taken}} {{during the period of}} military administration they were purely provisional and could not be allowed to prejudice the final settlement by the peace conference, at which no doubt the Arabs would have a representative. I added that the instructions to the military governors would preclude their mixing in political affairs, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> remove them if I found any of them contravening these orders. I reminded the Amir Faisal that the Allies were in honour bound to endeavour to reach a settlement in accordance with the wishes of the peoples concerned and urged him to place his trust whole-heartedly in their good faith.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{also had}} an {{influence}} over white people. In the case of Ethelred T. Brantley, Turner {{said that he was}} able to convince Brantley to [...] "cease from his wickedness". By the spring of 1828, Turner was convinced that he [...] "was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the Almighty". While working in his owner's fields on May 12, Turner [...] "heard a loud noise in the heavens, and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> take it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first".|$|E
2500|$|Discomfort in the British Army with {{possible}} military action within Ireland was {{to some extent}} mirrored in the Royal Navy. In Firedrake, Engineer Lieutenant Ranken informed his captain [...] "that I had signed the British Covenant <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be no party to any aggressive move against Ulster {{if that were the}} intention in sending us to Kingstown". Had General Paget, he declared, [...] "joined for passage during my regime only one course was open to me - to decline to be a party to propelling the ship". [...] Lieutenant Commander Barrow did not share his principles, and Ranken was relieved by another officer on 22 March. [...] On 2 April all naval forces, including Firedrake, were withdrawn for Easter leave, with no intention to return them. Although the Royal Navy soon returned to prevent gun-running to the Ulster Volunteers, Firedrake {{does not appear to have}} taken part.|$|E

6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Bickley, [...] "that I {{want to see}} {{all this}} supernatural rubbish {{thoroughly}} exploded, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> therefore <b>I</b> <b>should</b> prefer {{to go on with}} the business." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said, 'I felt my {{strength}} gradually returning, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> much prefer travelling on horseback. A carriage,' I added, 'is so close'-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{but just}} in time I see, Sir Archie," [...] Bruce said, {{pointing}} to the breach in the wall; [...] "a few hours more <b>and</b> methinks <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have indeed}} had some small hurt," [...] said Nigel feebly; [...] "but it is shame <b>and</b> sorrow <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> lie here {{if there is}} work for my hands. Whither go you, archer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naturally {{my mother}} is anxious, {{for the sake of}} Charlie <b>and</b> Lucy, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> live to carry on the mill until Charlie is old enough to run it himself," [...] Ned said bitterly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a {{stranger}} to Mrs. Delamayn," [...] the lady answered. [...] "The servant informed {{me that she had}} gone out; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find Mr. Delamayn here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, papa, I can do another. But, I wonder! <b>I</b> put <b>that</b> extortionate {{price on}} it, {{thinking}} {{no one would}} give it, <b>and</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> keep it for you. Who has it, Mary?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{look just}} like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet <b>and</b> lovely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress," [...] cried Amy, {{surveying}} her with delight when all was done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your presence, my lord," [...] said Eveline, [...] "will {{more than}} console him for my absence. It is fitting <b>and</b> proper <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> meet my aunt's {{advances}} to reconciliation, since she has condescended to make them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did. He {{said that}} the death was a very mysterious one, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{certainly}} be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me into remaining silent." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{told me that}} {{everything}} would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words and the best advice.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wonder you}} {{did not make a}} dash at her and pull her out of the arm-chair," [...] said Miss Dunstable. [...] "I was expecting it, <b>and</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> come to grief in the scrimmage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] she said, smiling sweetly, <b>and</b> signing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{take her}} hand--"Then live, Norman Leslie, {{for this is}} to me an easy thing and a joyous. Thou art a clerk, hast thou wherewithal to write?" ...|$|R
60|$|I was not {{alarmed at}} the news, having a full {{satisfaction}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be otherwise provided for; <b>and</b> especially considering <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had reason {{every day to}} expect <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be with child, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be obliged to remove without any pretences for it.|$|R
