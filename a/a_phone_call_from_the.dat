5|$|Khánh was {{not present}} at his ouster, because he was north of Saigon, {{inspecting}} a display of captured communist weapons.

5|$|The 1948 {{season was}} one of the most {{successful}} years for the Lafayette College football team. Led by captain Danny Kovacs and standout running back David Showell, the team had a record of seven wins and two losses. After starting the year beating Fordham University by a score of 53 to 14, Lafayette suffered a large loss in its following game at Army, losing 54 to 7. The Leopards then won each of their next four games by an average scoring margin of 26 points, but they soon lost to Rutgers University by three touchdowns. After defeating Ohio Wesleyan, Lafayette set itself up for a crucial bout against its rival, Lehigh University. However, on November 19, 1948, a day before the game against Lehigh, Lafayette received <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun Bowl Committee inviting the team to participate in the bowl game. This invitation essentially rendered Lafayette's season finale against Lehigh meaningless. Nevertheless, Lafayette went on to defeat Lehigh by a score of 23 to 13, capping off the regular season.|$|E

Back at his apartment, he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), who tell him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer, immediately after he learned of Archer's death. Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George) believes that Spade shot his partner so he could have her.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Monto a {{few minutes}} after 11:00 on a direct track towards Caboolture carrying the pilot and five non-paying passengers. The weather for the flight was expected to be VFR (visual flight rules) conditions with good visibility, high clouds and light winds. At 13:15, the aircraft contacted air traffic control, reporting an approximate position 69km north of Caboolture and requesting assistance with navigation. Shortly after, the pilot issued a distress call as the aircraft had entered thick cloud. Controllers in Brisbane then communicated positional information to the aircraft directly and relayed via other pilots in the area due to difficulties with radio reception. A friend of one of the passengers aboard Riama received <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, reporting that they were lost in cloud and unable to maintain altitude at around 13:20. Over the next hour, witnesses in the area around the crash site reported seeing the aircraft flying in and out of cloud at low level. At 13:48, the pilot reported he had one hour of fuel remaining and the last transmission from the aircraft came at 14:04. Neither the aircraft or the pilot were equipped or certified to fly without visual reference to the ground.|$|E

A {{journalist}} for a [...] "local East St. Louis paper" [...] noticed this, and called Selman to ask him why they were [...] "taking a shot at East St. Louis". Selman jokingly replied: [...] "because it's a crack-ridden slum". After the interview, he went on vacation in Greece for two weeks. While Selman was on vacation, executive producer and the episode's showrunner Mike Scully received <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons publicist Antonia Coffman, who reported that Selman's comment on East St. Louis had been taken [...] "very seriously" [...] by the newspaper.

500|$|Prompted {{in part by}} Salinger's letter, Bakshi briefly {{retired to}} focus on painting. During this time he {{completed}} the screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, a live-action feature he had been developing since the late 1960s. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios he pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, [...] "They thought {{that no one was}} going to admit that women can—and do—cheat on their husbands. They thought it was too hot, which made no sense." [...] In 1985, he received <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Rolling Stones' manager, Tony King, who told Bakshi that the band had recorded a cover of Bob & Earl's [...] "Harlem Shuffle", and wanted Bakshi to direct the music video. He was told that the live-action shoot needed to be completed within one day (January 28, 1986) for it to be shown at the Grammy Awards. Production designer Wolf Kroeger was forced to drastically compact his sets, and animation director and designer John Kricfalusi had to push his team, including Lynne Naylor, Jim Smith and Bob Jaques, to complete the animation within a few weeks. The band's arrival at the set was delayed by a snowstorm and several takes were ruined when the cameras crossed paths. Bakshi was forced to pay the union wages out of his own fees, and the continuity between Kricfalusi's animation and the live-action footage did not match; however, the video was completed on time.|$|E
