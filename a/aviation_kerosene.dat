50|$|The SR.N4 craft were {{powered by}} four Bristol Proteus gas turbine engines which {{consumed}} {{significant amounts of}} <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene.</b> As the world wide oil crisis of the 1970s caused fuel prices to rise sharply, {{the operation of the}} SR.N4 became increasingly uneconomic. Furthermore, the closure of the British Hovercraft Corporation meant that maintenance of the craft was also costly and no new design or build was likely. Indeed, ‘’Sure’’ was taken out of service in 1983 and cannibalised for parts to keep the rest of the fleet operating. Seaspeed (and later Hoverspeed) operated a single French built SEDAM N500 craft from 1977 but it was beset by design and operational problems and was withdrawn from somewhat sporadic service in 1983 and later scrapped.|$|E

40|$|The fuel {{used in the}} {{aviation}} engineering has to be clean and dry, it may not contain mechanical impurities and water. Water in <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> may occur in soluble and insoluble form. The danger inheres in the insoluble form, which may drop out in the crystalline form and cause various failures, such as those caused by mechanical impurities. The water assists in the biological matter formation created by various species of microorganisms (bacteria, mould fungi and yeast). The microorganisms, present in water phase occurring {{on the bottom of}} tanks or on the interface water phase – kerosene, grow and reproduce and subsequently may pollute (impair) the fuel by the biomass or by the products of their metabolism. There is a possibility to infect the fuel artificially by a selected reference microorganism strain, which usually occur in contaminated fuel, or by microorganisms which cause a biological contamination of <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene.</b> Out of the selected reference strains used in the experiments, the reference strains of Proteus vulgaris, Sacharamyces cerevisiae and Clostridium perfringens were not cultivated in the sterile <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> and the propagating nutrient medium.

40|$|Abstract The {{application}} of short-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (SW-NIRS) in acidity of <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> was de-scribed on {{the term of}} chemometrics. This spectral region is interesting because this type of spectrometer reduces costs in comparison with traditional long-wave near-infrared (LW-NIR) instrument. The SW-NIR calibration models of <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> were established by partial least square regression (PLS). Satisfactory calibration statistics were obtained with a standard error of calibration (SEC) of 0. 028 mgKOH/ 100 mL and a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0. 036 mgKOH/ 100 mL. A t-test showed that the NIRS model had an accuracy equivalent to that of GB/T 264 - 91, which was equal to ASTM D 847, {{in the analysis of}} acidity of <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene.</b> The NIRS method had the advantages of rapid analysis, better repeatability, little simple, and online analysis, etc...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The oil {{absorption}} performances of PBMA, P(BMA-BA), PLMA and P(LMA-MMA) for <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> and dimethylbenzene were studied. The {{results showed that}} PBMA had perfect {{oil absorption}} for dimethylbenzene, absorptive ratio of P(BMA-BA) for <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> was the highest，and PLMA had great oil-absorbing amount for <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene.</b> Moreover, the kinetic mode of swelling process was discussed and correlative parameter indicated that the oil-absorbing process obeyed the first-order kinetics well. Foreword Currently, the ocean environment pollution caused by oil tankers leaking had accounted for 45 % of water pollution[1]. Owing to excellent oil-absorption capacity, rapid oil-absorption rate and oil retention ability of the three-dimensional network structure, Absorbing resin was bound {{to play an important}} role in dealing with aspects of marine oil spills. The research on absorbing resin was mainly focused on the performance with synthesis factors and process conditions, while less on the kinetic parameters of the process. The kinetics of oil-absorbing resin directly reflected the rate of absorbing oil, and the oil absorption at any time under the saturation condition can be gotten by studying the kinetics.

40|$|During {{the past}} thirty years two major {{concerns}} have developed with our current fuels. These concerns are reliable supplies and pollution. Because of these problems there has been a great interest in alternate fuels such as alcohol and natural gas. Since 1997 research has been conducted at West Virginia University on methanol as an alternate fuel for gas turbines. There have been two main areas of study in this research, the problems associated with operating a gas turbine on methanol and exhaust gas emissions. There are two major differences between methanol and <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene</b> that affect the operation of a gas turbine. The first is methanol’s poor lubricating properties and the second is methanol’s lower heating value. During this research techniques have been developed to measure the lubricating properties of methanol and various additives. Suitable lubricant additives were found to improve methanol’s lubricity to equal that of <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene,</b> with as little as 1 % additive. The lower heating value of methanol required modifications to the WVU gas turbine’s fuel system and atomizer, to provide higher flow rate of fuel then required with <b>aviation</b> <b>kerosene.</b> The gas turbine was modified and operated on methanol for an extended period, without failure. Exhaust gas emissions were teste...|$|E
