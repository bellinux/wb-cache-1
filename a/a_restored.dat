5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue <b>a</b> <b>restored,</b> {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because {{he thought he would}} have great influence over <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople in the summer of 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|For several decades, {{no natural}} {{reproduction}} of pallid sturgeon was observed, {{since all the}} fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E

Skilled in avoiding all forms of detection and capable of helping his supporters to keep their Crime Coefficients low, only a very few believe that he actually exists, including Akane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a mine was {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845–54 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now {{used to make the}} footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.|$|E

Basiliscus, however, failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals; furthermore, they received letters from some of the leading ministers at the court, urging them to secure the return of Zeno, for the city now preferred <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers.|$|E

5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E
5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to the Prince of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then the Prince of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E

5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> channel at a {{reclaimed}} mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E

He saves Jin's life again, this time from a journalist who intended to avenge his family, who had been killed by Jin. After seeing his half-brother, Kazuya Mishima, killing Heihachi, Lars reveals that the reason for him saving Jin was that he wants him to kill Kazuya and restore world peace, to which Jin agrees.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette {{was held}} at Nivelles, then {{transferred}} to Luxembourg where a coalition military tribunal declared him, de Pusy, and two others to be prisoners of state for their roles in the Revolution. The tribunal ordered them held until <b>a</b> <b>restored</b> French king could render final judgment on them. On 12 September 1792, pursuant to the tribunal's order, the prisoners were transferred to Prussian custody. The party travelled to the Prussian fortress-city of Wesel, where the Frenchmen remained in verminous individual cells in the central citadel from 19 September to 22 December 1792. When victorious French revolutionary troops began to threaten the Rhineland, King Frederick WilliamII transferred the prisoners east to the citadel at Magdeburg, where they remained an entire year, from 4 January 1793 to 4 January 1794.|$|E
