5|$|The {{music video}} begins with showing Madonna, the torero (Muñoz), and the townspeople {{preparing}} for, then attending, a bullfight. A secondary staging {{in the video}} presents Madonna standing or sitting near a television set in a room (lit by a single light source from above), while a third staging depicts Madonna writhing around on a bed in her underwear as she watches Muñoz on the television. In the bullring, the torero kills the bull <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> home and physically and emotionally abuses Madonna. The video {{can be viewed as}} a statement on classicism, supposing the bullfighter feels threatened and angered by the aristocrat's station, resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her.|$|E
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

Outraged by this, Harvard alumnus Toofer tells him to take it off. When Frank refuses, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> into work the next day in full Harvard regalia, Toofer retaliates by dressing up as Frank. Unable to back down for fear of their coworkers mocking them, their argument is eventually mediated [...] "Cajun style" [...] by [...] James Carville, who then proceeds to also demonstrate how to steal candy from a vending machine..."Cajun style." ...|$|E
500|$|Tomoyo {{also has}} a younger brother named [...] who is very skilled with computers. He {{installs}} a personal computer in Tomoya's room, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> {{to live in the}} apartment. Takafumi has an ex-girlfriend named [...] with a foul mouth and who is excessively sarcastic, whose surname is not revealed. She is not happy that her mother remarried and thus does not like to live at home. She too comes to live in Tomoya's apartment. She has a cameo appearance roughly eighteen minutes into episode six of the Clannad anime series. A central theme in the story is the ties between families, much like in Clannad.|$|E
500|$|The Harry Potter {{series has}} been criticised for {{supposedly}} supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling {{refused to speak}} out about her religion, stating, [...] "If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, {{will be able to}} guess what's coming in the books". However, many have noted Christian allegories apparent in Deathly Hallows. For example, Harry dies <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross. Harry also urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his shattered soul. Rowling also stated that [...] "my belief and my struggling with religious belief... I think is quite apparent in this book", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.|$|E

500|$|Although it was {{originally}} thought that Darren Criss would be missing [...] "one and a half episodes", and therefore might return in time to appear in this episode after missing the twelfth one, co-star Chris Colfer initially stated that Criss would not be appearing: [...] "You'll find out how [...] leaves {{for a little bit}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> back, but it’s nothing too bad or serious". He later said that Blaine [...] "is in the episode, it's not in the way you might think"; Criss did return in time to appear in the musical finale. Recurring guest stars who are appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Lengies), Principal Figgins (Theba), Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Rosemont) and stepfather Burt Hummel (O'Malley), former McKinley student Dave Karofsky (Adler) and McKinley football player Shane Tinsley (Tinker).|$|E
500|$|... "La Isla Bonita" [...] is a Hispanic styled pop song. It {{is one of}} the {{characteristic}} works of the collaboration between Madonna and Patrick Leonard. The single mixes the sound of different instruments like Cuban drums and Spanish guitar, maracas and harmonicas and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. The song is written in the key of C minor and is set in the time signature of common time like most pop songs, moving at a moderate tempo of 95 beats per minute. The song starts with a musical introduction performed on a Cuban drum, before descending into synthesized beats and Spanish guitar fusion. Madonna sings the chorus in the same G3 to C5 range. After the second chorus there is a Spanish guitar interlude whence Madonna's voice expands to F minor as she sings [...] "I want to be where the sun warms the sky" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> down to a C minor when she sings [...] "loves a girl". There is another musical interlude with a harmonica and the song, after another chorus, ends with fading out and Madonna's voice uttering the words [...] "El dijo que te ama (He said he loves you)".|$|E

2500|$|As though intentional, its severe, almost forbidding {{exterior}} contrasted {{sharply with}} the extravagance of the interior. A 1912 visitor recounts: [...] "Beyond the reception offices are two lavishly decorated rooms, in the Louis XIV and Louis XV styles respectively <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> the central hall, which is a dream of beauty and symmetry. Here the architecture, {{which is responsible for}} so many wonderful effects in Heliopolis, reaches its artistic zenith. Damascus-made Oriental lamps hung from every corner and cranny hang." ...|$|E
2500|$|Horowitz {{wrote about}} {{genocide}}: “First comes the act <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> the word: first [...] genocide is committed {{and then the}} language emerges to describe a phenomenon." [...] He published lasting contributions on the subject, including Genocide: State power & mass murder; Taking lives: Genocide & state power; and [...] "Genocide and the reconstruction of social theory: Observations on the exclusivity of collective death" [...] in Armenian Review. Horowitz's last scholarly pieces on genocide were his preface to R. J. Rummel's Death by government, and his essay on state-sponsored terror, [...] "Counting Bodies. The Dismal Science of Authorized Terror" [...] in Patterns of Prejudice. In Summer 1994, a volume of essays in honour of Horowitz was published by Transaction Publishers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project had}} been envisaged as two parts since 2006, but the {{proposed}} {{contents of the}} parts changed during development. MGM expressed interest in a second film in 2006, set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Jackson concurred, stating that [...] "one of the drawbacks of The Hobbit is its relatively light weight compared to LOTR ... There's a lot of sections in which a character like Gandalf disappears for a while.– he references going off {{to meet with the}} White Council, who are actually characters like Galadriel and Saruman and people that we see in Lord of the Rings. He mysteriously vanishes for a while <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> back, but we don't really know what goes on." [...] Jackson was also interested in showing Gollum's journey to Mordor and Aragorn setting a watch on the Shire.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} have drawn {{attention to the}} Biblical themes and references in J. K. Rowling's final Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In an August 2007 issue of Newsweek, Lisa Miller commented that Harry dies <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> back to life to save humankind, like Christ. She points out {{the title of the}} chapter in which this occurs—"King's Cross"—a possible allusion to Christ's cross. Also, she outlines the scene in which Harry is temporarily dead, pointing out that it places Harry in a very heaven-like setting where he talks to a father figure [...] "whose supernatural powers are accompanied by a profound message of love." [...] Jeffrey Weiss adds, in the Dallas Morning News, that the biblical quotation [...] "And the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" [...] (1 Corinthians 15:26), featured on the tombstones of Harry's parents, refers to Christ's resurrection. The quotation on Dumbledore's family tomb, [...] "Where your treasure is, your heart will be also", is from Matthew 6:21, and refers to knowing which things in life are of true value.|$|E
2500|$|The first derivations of {{relativity}} of simultaneity by synchronization with light signals were also simplified. Daniel Frost Comstock (1910) placed an observer {{in the middle}} between two clocks A and B. From this observer a signal is sent to both clocks, and in the frame in which A and B are at rest, they synchronously start to run. But {{from the perspective of}} a system in which A and B are moving, clock B is first set in motion, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> clock A– so the clocks are not synchronized. Also Einstein (1917) created a model with an observer in the middle between A and B. However, in his description two signals are sent from A and B to the observer. From the perspective of the frame in which A and B are at rest, the signals are sent at the same time and the observer [...] "is hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cibber {{returned}} to England, and began negotiating {{a settlement with}} Susannah Maria and Sloper, punctuated by an absurd but successful attempt to abduct Susannah Maria from Sloper's country house that ended with {{all three of them}} staying at the same inn, despite Sloper firing a pistol over Cibber's head. Theophilus confined his wife to a house in Wild Court, Great Wild Street, from where she was rescued by her brother Thomas who broke in and knocked out the guard. Theophilus had Thomas imprisoned in Bridewell temporarily, and Susannah Maria {{returned to}} Sloper. Becoming greedy, Cibber sued Sloper for £5,000 damages for criminal conversation, which he described as threatening [...] "his peace of mind, his happiness, and his hopes of posterity". The prosecution produced witnesses, lodging house keepers Mr and Mrs Hayes, who admitted to spying on Sloper and Mrs Cibber through a wainscot partition, thus establishing adultery beyond doubt. Sloper's defence counsel rebutted by calling the Kensington housekeeper, Anne Hopson, who testified that Cibber received money from Sloper with full knowledge of his wife's affair. The defence said of Cibber: [...] "He takes his money, lets him maintain his family, resigns his wife to him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> to court for justice, for reparation in damages." [...] Counsel concluded that [...] "there is no denomination in coin small enough to give in damages." [...] The jury concurred, and awarded Cibber a nominal £10.|$|E

2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E
