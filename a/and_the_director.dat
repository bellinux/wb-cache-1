5|$|Aronofsky {{originally}} planned to direct The Fountain on a $70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett {{in the lead}} roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production.

Production mainly took place on a sound stage in Montreal, Quebec, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> used macro photography to create key visual effects for The Fountain at a low cost.|$|E

5|$|In 1966 an {{exhibition}} at Leeds College of Art of paintings by the Cyprus-born British artist Stass Paraskos, entitled Lovers and Romances, was prosecuted by the City of Leeds police <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> of Public Prosecutions under the Vagrancy Acts of 1828 and 1837, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When the exhibition opened it was allegedly visited {{by a local}} school group, the leader of which objected to an image depicting a woman masturbating a man. The exhibition was raided {{by the police and}} closed down. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos's defence, including Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and a message of support from Britain's Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Paraskos lost the trial and was fined twenty-five pounds. The case was later cited in the report of a working party convened in 1968, under the chairmanship of John Montgomerie, by the Arts Council of Great Britain, to review the obscenity laws in England and Wales. In this report it was suggested the artist should not have been prosecuted in this case, even if the works of art were deemed obscene, as he was not the publisher as defined by the Obscene Publications Act.|$|E
