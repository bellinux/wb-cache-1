5|$|Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} English-speaking settlers {{as early as}} the late 1730s; most came from Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Noreen, who is a Roman Catholic, worked as a farmhand in Sheikhupura to support her family.

Before her incarceration, she had been repeatedly urged by her fellow workers to convert to Islam.|$|E
5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of Mysteries of the Siths {{content was}} {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; one of the game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, new dialogue was recorded for Mysteries of the Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts in Dark Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> the Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> the Adriatic.|$|E

5|$|During the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator. Several changes in sea level {{occurred}} and the coal deposits of Lanarkshire and West Lothian and limestones of Fife and Dunbar date from this time. There are oil shales near Bathgate around which the 19th-century oil-processing industry developed, <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> the Midland Valley there are ironstones and fire clay deposits that had significance in the early Industrial Revolution. Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a Carboniferous forest. More volcanic activity formed Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the nearby Bathgate Hills.|$|E
5|$|Following Japanese {{victories}} in Malaya, Singapore <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific in late 1941 and early 1942, the whole 15th Battalion was mobilised for wartime service and tasked with undertaking defensive duties {{along the coast}} of south-east Queensland, based at Caloundra, due to concerns of a potential invasion. The invasion did not occur and, in mid-1942, the 15th Battalion was transferred to the 29th Brigade. Consisting of the 42nd and 47th Battalions, the 29th was part of the 5th Division, and was moved north to Townsville, where the battalion served as a garrison force.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, {{took over}} the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, {{inherited}} the company upon his death in 1948. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances. The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Europe and around the world.|$|E

5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> the Sahara, but {{the description of}} Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon. The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on the description of I. orientalis, and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Offenbach {{produced}} {{his first}} full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), which was exceptionally well received and has remained {{one of his}} most played works. During the 1860s, he produced at least 18 full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces. His works from this period included La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868). The risqué humour (often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London <b>and</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E
