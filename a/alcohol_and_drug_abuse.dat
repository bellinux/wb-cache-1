25|$|Two {{investigations}} were conducted. The {{first by}} Ron Lieberman, her husband, and private investigator Ken Gallant, a former FBI agent, initially presumed her disappearance and possible death were {{unrelated to the}} attacks but later concluded {{it was the most}} likely outcome. A later investigation by New York City police delved into her life leading up to September 11 and found details of a double life, a history of marital problems, possible affairs with other women, job difficulties and <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> by Philip, as well as a pending criminal charge against her, in the months before her disappearance. This led them to conclude it was just as likely that she had met a different fate.|$|E
40|$|<b>Alcohol</b> <b>and</b> Other <b>Drug</b> <b>abuse</b> in {{adolescents}} <b>and</b> adults {{continues to be}} a major public health problem in the United States.

The focus {{of this paper is to}} illustrate and highlight the value of prevention programs which emphasize altering maladaptive behavior before the behavior becomes problematic. Emotional Intelligence is not only an indicator of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> other <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> but is linked to emotional competence, social and emotional learning, the development of healthy and life promoting behavior, and has been proven to reduce some of the risk factors associated with <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> other <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> {{in adolescents}} <b>and</b> adults. This paper seeks to recognize the significance of Emotional Intelligence as a desirable health promoting attribute and to establish the importance of its conceptual use in a prevention based model for reducing associated high risk behaviors...|$|R

In 2000, he released his first solo album, Alone with Everybody, which reached number 1 in the UK album charts.

25|$|Although several {{theories}} of the ultimate cause of the singer's death persist to this day (including a few rather sinister ones), given what is now known about cardiovascular disease, {{it seems likely that}} by {{the time of his death}} Vysotsky had an advanced coronary condition brought about by years of tobacco, <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> as well as his grueling work schedule and the stress of the constant harassment by the government. Towards the end, most of Vysotsky's closest friends had become aware of the ominous signs and were convinced that his demise was only a matter of time. Clear evidence of this can be seen in a video ostensibly shot by the Japanese NHK channel only months before Vysotsky's death, where he appears visibly unwell, breathing heavily and slurring his speech. Accounts by Vysotsky's close friends and colleagues concerning his last hours were compiled in the book by V. Perevozchikov.|$|E
25|$|Māori suffer more health problems, {{including}} {{higher levels}} of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> smoking and obesity. Less frequent use of healthcare services mean that late diagnosis and treatment intervention lead to {{higher levels of}} morbidity and mortality in many manageable conditions, such as cervical cancer, diabetes per head of population than non-Māori. Although Māori life expectancy rates have increased dramatically in the last 50 years, they still have considerably lower life-expectancies compared to New Zealanders of European ancestry: in 2004, Māori males lived 69.0 years vs. non-Māori males 77.2 years; Māori females 73.2 yrs vs. non-Māori females 81.9 years. This gap had narrowed by 2013: 72.8 years for men and 76.5 years for women, compared to 80.2 years for non-Māori men and 83.7 years for non-Māori women. Also, {{a recent study by the}} New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse showed that Māori women and children are more likely to experience domestic violence than any other ethnic group.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} boys and girls who {{manipulate}} their body in a permanent way with tattoo and body piercing is an ever-increasing number.

Considering adolescence as a critical period, this paper indicates the needfulness to monitor adolescents who manifest these behavioral tendencies not only to identify possible related medical complications, but also in order to recognize useful and early indicators of their feeling of uneasiness.
