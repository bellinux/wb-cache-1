5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E
5|$|Streep {{established}} {{herself as}} a leading Hollywood actress in the 1980s. She played dual roles in the period drama The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981), and starred as a Polish holocaust survivor in Sophie's Choice (1982). She was awarded the Best Actress Oscar for the latter. Streep portrayed the real-life character of Karen Silkwood in Mike Nichols' drama Silkwood (1983), before starring in her most financially successful release of the decade, the romantic drama Out of Africa (1985), in which she played the Danish writer Karen Blixen. Despite intermittent successes, Streep's career went {{through a period of}} decline post-1985, with several commentators criticizing her for her inclination towards melodramatic roles. The criticism continued despite her attempts to actively star in commercial comedies; her roles that parodied women's beauty and <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> the films She-Devil (1989) and Death Becomes Her (1992) were panned.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was first}} {{published}} during {{the early days of}} the Modern Age of Comics, and so its themes were as dark, edgy, politically and morally complex as its contemporaries. The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often places their era's culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano would be the first to put his political views in the series, an element never before seen in mainstream comics, such as his negative views of Thatcher's regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, in that he fights the political and social injustice of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel <b>aging.</b> <b>In</b> addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavors of vanilla and spice complement the natural grape flavors of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence in making that barrel size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger oak flavors that are less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role with oak from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ageing</b> <b>in</b> place" {{has gained}} {{dominance}} in policy worldwide {{for more than}} one and a half decades. This paper explores the significance of place <b>in</b> <b>ageing,</b> <b>in</b> particular within the context of globalisation and immigration. In order to promote the value and participation of older ethnic people in communities, the New Zealand Government has acknowledged cultural diversity <b>in</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place policies. However, the concept of <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place is based predominantly on middle-class and Euro-centric values. The policies based on such understandings may not be as applicable to the ethnic Chinese. Moreover, <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place policies sometimes simply appear to ignore the fact that cultural norms (such as parent-child co-residence in the filial piety practice) may have changed when the migrant is affected by acculturation processes in a Western cultural context. These issues indicate that more culturally attuned research is needed about <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place among older Chinese immigrants. Using a Chinese case study conducted in New Zealand, the present research is designed to explore older Chinese migrants’ experiences of <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> place. This paper answers the following research questions: 1) why did the participants immigrate to New Zealand; 2) were they relatively permanently settled; 3) why they moved; and 4) what are their current living arrangements...|$|R
