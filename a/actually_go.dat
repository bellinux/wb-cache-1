Afterwards the fans showed their appreciation of the match by throwing money into the ring, causing both Panther and Navarro to <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> into the seats to collect more money after the match. Both Panther and Navarro teased {{that they were going}} to continue to fight, which drew a favorable response from the crowd. Before the fifth match of the night Ray Mendoza, Jr. took the microphone and announced to the crowd that this would actually be his last match as a professional wrestler. Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both the second and third fall to win the entire match. In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1. The third fall was longer than both the previous falls combined and finally saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. successfully defend the championship when he forced La Sombra to submit.|$|E

500|$|The {{final scene}} of [...] "Stick", {{featuring}} {{a conversation between}} Stick and Stone, was meant to hint at further ties between the series and {{other areas of the}} MCU {{in the same way as}} Marvel's film post-credits scenes, though it could not <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> after the episode's credits due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one. There were discussions about having another such [...] "coda" [...] at the end of the season finale, one which would have featured Leland Owlsley attempting to escape New York, only to be killed by the Punisher in a surprise introduction. The scene would not have shown the actor's face, but would have included the character's iconic skull insignia. The idea was dropped, again because of Netflix's playing system, and Owlsley was ultimately killed by Fisk in the episode, with the introduction of the Punisher saved for the series' second season.|$|E
500|$|Rousseau {{is named}} after French-Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Although Rousseau is French, actress Mira Furlan is Croatian, which led to {{speculation}} that Rousseau is not really from France.

Furlan understood Rousseau's decision to not meet her daughter, believing that no one can ever be prepared for that moment. Furlan met Raymonde for the first time just minutes before shooting their reunion scene in the season three finale. The actors believed the scene to be a [...] "huge moment" [...] for their characters, which Furlan described as a [...] "basic human moment." [...] Furlan was glad to have [...] "such a beautiful partner," [...] and noted their physical resemblance.|$|E
500|$|When General Amherst left North America in 1763, {{it was on}} a {{leave of}} absence from his {{position}} as commander-in-chief. In 1764, Amherst announced that {{he had no intention of}} returning to North America, at which point Gage's appointment to that post was made permanent. (Amherst retained posts as governor of Virginia and colonel of the 60th Foot, positions he only gave up in 1768 when he was required to <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> to Virginia or give up the post.) [...] Intrigues of other high-ranking officers, especially Robert Monckton and his supporters, for his offices, continued throughout his tenure as commander-in-chief. Gage was promoted to lieutenant general in 1771. [...] In 1767 Gage ordered the arrest of Major Robert Rogers, the former leader of Rogers' Rangers who Gage had come to dislike and distrust during the war. The arrest was based on flimsy evidence that Rogers might have been engaging in a treasonous relationship with the French; he was acquitted in a 1768 court martial.|$|E

500|$|Universal spent $1.8 million {{promoting}} Jaws, {{including an}} unprecedented $700,000 {{on national television}} spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, {{in the description of}} film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal [...] "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" [...] for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that [...] "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that [...] "you had to <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> underneath the shark so you could see his teeth." ...|$|E

Rediff.com rated the album 4.5 out of 5, labelled it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj has delivered a soundtrack that is lethally explosive. Not that we expected anything less. And trust Gulzar to artfully craft {{a really long}} fuse for the Kaminey bomb, making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> boom." [...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that [...] "..."Kaminey" [...] is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal. Vishal Bhardwaj has proved his mettle yet again." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{also noted}} that the {{potential}} for interracial conflict remained unexplored; Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie wants to tease us with intimations of a steamy biracial liaison; it just doesn't want to <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> there." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe was disappointed that [...] "Obsessed basically plays it safe. The obvious racial buttons are never pushed". Greg Quill from the Toronto Star agreed, and wrote that Shill and Loughery [...] "stripped the drama of its potentially gripping – and obvious – racial overtones". However, Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out that having the two female roles of differing races [...] "creates racial tension", and noted similarities to [...] "the racially charged" [...] Lakeview Terrace (2008), which Loughery also wrote. Braun was of the impression that a well-written script was replaced by the film's [...] "racial politics". When Derek confronts Lisa at the business conference, she threatens him with a sexual harassment complaint; Sady Doyle from The Guardian wrote that this alludes to [...] "the history of black men being lynched for their perceived threat to white women". Doyle pointed out that historically white women are more revered for their beauty than black women, which is a side theme of the fight between Sharon and Lisa. Melissa Anderson of LA Weekly suggested that awkwardness of the interracial relationship of Derek and Lisa as a reason why the filmmakers did not have the two characters partake in any sexual activity.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{convinced}} Fox {{to promote}} the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck itself, and organized several dives to the site {{over a period of}} two years. [...] "My pitch on that had {{to be a little more}} detailed," [...] said Cameron. [...] "So I said, 'Look, we've got to do this whole opening where they're exploring the Titanic and they find the diamond, so we're going to have all these shots of the ship." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "Now, we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> shoot it at the real wreck." [...] The crew shot at the real wreck in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995 and actually spent more time with the ship than its passengers. At that depth, with a water pressure of 6,000 pounds per square inch, [...] "one small flaw in the vessel's superstructure would mean instant death for all on board." [...] Not only were the dives high-risk, but adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high quality footage that he wanted. During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with Titanics hull, damaging both sub and ship and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of Captain Smith's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior. The area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was also damaged.|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> through in high school." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the novel, the Law forbids {{violence}} between {{the inhabitants of}} the Place. Despite its seemingly unyielding nature, it is in fact broken several times, though always with [...] "good reason". In the story [...] "His Mate", Lad meets and later must win the heart of his mate, Lady. Lad is clearly [...] "enthralled" [...] by the adult Lady's sexual appeal. As Terhune seems reluctant to note the facts of canine mating, Lady is never stated to <b>actually</b> <b>go</b> into heat. Instead the relationship is framed {{within the context of a}} [...] "human courtly love triangle" [...] when the [...] "showy" [...] Knave comes to the Place and Lady forgets Lad and fawns on the new arrival. When Lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted bald eagle, the master breaks the rules against violence and intends to beat her. Lad, in turn, breaks the rules of perfect obedience and growls, becoming the object of punishment and taking the beating in her stead. At the end of the story, when the master realizes he was mistaken, he apologizes to Lad for beating the wrong dog. Despite the novel's overall theme of nonviolence, the master's [...] "unreasonable attachment to the bird" [...] becomes the motivation for his [...] "cruelty toward the helpless dogs", yet Lad perceives the Master's actions as [...] "reasonable and functional". Though the numerous tenets of the Law forbid violence in various forms, if the dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with [...] "any amount of violence." [...] This change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in the Master, and his having a [...] "childish fixation on having his own way", showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered: everyday life. Throughout many of the stories, a consistent theme is the Master's imposition of will, behind which is the [...] "blind rage of a child who cannot get exactly what he wants." ...|$|E
