2500|$|A plaque in the background, headed 'Letter to America, 2 January 1850' tells one family's sad story: [...] "I am now, I may say, {{alone in}} the world. All my {{brothers}} and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all Ireland in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vice President of the United States (and {{therefore}} President of the Senate) Joe Biden: [...] "A {{very close}} friend of mine, one of my mentors, {{a guy who was}} there when I was a 29-year-old kid being sworn into the United States Senate. Shortly thereafter, a guy who stood in the rain, in the pouring rain, freezing rain outside a church as I buried my daughter and my wife before I got sworn in ... We lost the dean of the United States Senate, but also the state of West Virginia lost its most fierce advocate <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I lost a dear friend.|$|E
2500|$|Oshii noted his {{attention}} to detail might be particularly Japanese: [...] "I get absorbed in the finer points [...] like what {{the back of a}} bottle label looks like when you see it through the glass [...] That's very Japanese, I suppose. I want people {{to go back to the}} film again and again to pick up things they missed the first time." [...] Describing the overall look, the director said, [...] "The film is set in the future, but it's looking at present-day society. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> there's an autobiographical element as well. I'm looking back at some of the things I liked as a child — the 1950s cars and so on. Basically, I wanted to create a different world — not a future world." ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. Yes. (Carelessly.) Oh, {{he found}} me O.K. I'm fine <b>and</b> dandy, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, have sewed a {{sprig of}} the mountain-ash into his collar," [...] said the good woman, [...] "which will avail {{more than your}} clerkship, I wus; but for all that, it is ill to seek the devil or his mates either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{standing}} opposite to the gentleman here who is holding my other hand; <b>and</b> (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> already) you have met {{to fight a}} duel." ...|$|R
2500|$|On October 1, 2013, {{after months}} of {{speculation}} dating back to {{before the start of}} the season, Greater Western Sydney shocked the football public by withdrawing their offer of $1.2 million per year for six years, announcing that they were of the belief that Franklin was set to sign with the Sydney Swans. The Sydney Swans' chairman, Andrew Ireland, said later that day that the contract offered to Franklin was a nine-year deal worth $10 million, and that Franklin's management first approached the Swans about the move shortly after the 2012 AFL Grand Final, when Franklin played in a losing side against the Swans. The next day, Franklin said that he did not make his decision to move to Sydney [...] "until the last minute". He also said, [...] "I'm looking forward to getting up to Sydney. It's a great footy club <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I had to pack my bags up at Hawthorn and saying goodbye to the boys is something very tough, and upsetting, too". Franklin's manager, Liam Pickering, also revealed that the nine-year contract was so back-ended that he would be making less money with the Swans in 2014–15 than he was at Hawthorn in 2013.|$|E
6000|$|Undoubtedly {{he meant}} invasion, sir, [...] Had fortune favoured. He may try it yet. [...] <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> could we but close with Fox--- ...|$|E

60|$|Such is the Hanbury Street Workshop, {{where the}} Army {{makes the best}} use it can of rather {{indifferent}} human materials, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> loses money at the business.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> {{concerning}} ministers, so I say {{to all the}} brethren, {{carry it}} so, that all the world may see, that indeed you are the sons of love.|$|R
60|$|In a word, the two {{men were}} brought upon deck, and soundly whipped and pickled; and they all proved very honest ever after: <b>and</b> these, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> at first, were two-and-thirty in all.|$|R
60|$|The {{architecture}} of the Greeks and Romans themselves was not good, but it was natural; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, good in some respects, and for a particular time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{leaning over}} the table on his elbow and genially gesturing at him with his forefinger: [...] "yes, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> you don't remark the sting of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blessed Jesus be thanked," [...] {{said the}} giant, [...] "for I have always heard you called a perfect knight; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I will follow you {{all my life}} long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He had till ten, mother," [...] <b>said</b> I; <b>and</b> just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it our old clock began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but {{the news}} was good, for it was only six.|$|R
60|$|So Ahab had {{committed}} a horrible and great sin, and had received sentence for it, <b>and</b> now, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, {{there was nothing}} to be done but to repent; and he did so, after his fashion.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, my Mother, my Mother, I am your son, your son; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> at the {{beginning}} I will return to your arms from out of this country, when God shall permit! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{continued}} Keswick, [...] "our engagement was {{dissolved in}} {{consequence of a}} certain family complication, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, I hope in time {{to be able to}} renew it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought {{ten days}} {{would be as}} long as you would care to have me here, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that I would be back by the first, I would rather not change my plans." ...|$|E
60|$|RAMSDEN. [irritably] Yes, yes, Annie: this is {{all very}} well, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> quite natural and becoming. But you must make a choice {{one way or the}} other. We are as much in a dilemma as you.|$|E
60|$|And this {{relation}} to the higher arts we will study at the source of chief power in all the normal skill of Christendom, Florence; <b>and</b> chiefly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{in the work of}} one Florentine master, Sandro Botticelli.|$|R
60|$|And then I have found--no, I am mistaken. My door, {{you will}} understand, is open. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> these words, a large green parrot comes 'opping out. My assassin {{is nothing but}} a green parrot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I {{can tell}} you again. 'Twas Sprowls <b>and</b> Mooney, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Miss B'retta Sprowls {{it was in the}} theatres, but Missis Mooney she was. My house is well known for respectability. The {{marriage}} certificate hung, framed, on a nail over--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so {{convenient}} to get," [...] said Fanny; [...] "and no decent young man ever gets drunk at parties, so it can't do any harm; besides, one must have something, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{it will look}} shabby not to have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both," [...] {{replied the}} young man, leaning {{back with a}} sigh of repletion, and wiping his mouth. [...] "I was {{released}} to-day, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I shall be court-martialled again to-day fortnight. It'll be two years this time. But they can't break me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Flibbertigibbet," [...] {{answered}} Wayland, [...] "hath {{that about}} him which may redeem his turn for mischievous frolic; {{for he is}} as faithful when attached as he is tricky and malignant to strangers, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, I have cause to say so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The other," [...] said Mr. Vyner {{slowly and}} {{lowering}} his voice, [...] "the other stands before you. All he can urge in his favour is, {{that he is}} younger than Trimblett, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> on another occasion, with——" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And how do you, sir,' {{continued}} the Baronet, 'if {{you are a}} captain in his Majesty's service--how do you chance to be travelling in Scotland without letters of introduction, credentials, baggage, or anything belonging to your pretended rank, estate, <b>and</b> condition, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{he is not}} dead," [...] he {{continued}} in answer to the agonized expression of inquiry in her eyes. [...] "He has been stunned by the blow of a tomahawk, <b>and</b> is, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> badly hurt; but he will, I trust, get over it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{said the}} boy, [...] "he muttered {{that if he}} came not your worship would bolt out what were better kept in; and so he took his old flat cap, and threadbare blue cloak, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, he will be here incontinent." ...|$|E
60|$|SNOW. [Rather sardonically.] I might point out, sir, that to {{withdraw}} the charge of stealing would not make much difference, because the facts must come out [he looks significantly at JACK] {{in reference to the}} assault; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that charge will have to go forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "My only plan," [...] I answered, [...] "is to {{ride over}} the hills and far away! How far I really do not know; and I shall be alone except for this good companion." [...] <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> this I patted the handle-bar of my bicycle.|$|E
60|$|But {{the thing}} was {{necessary}} to Milton, who wanted to assign some cause or original of the Devil's Rebellion; <b>and</b> so, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> above, the design is well laid, it only wants two Trifles call'd Truth and History; so I leave it to struggle for itself.|$|R
60|$|Into this tent I {{brought all}} my provisions, and {{everything}} that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed <b>and</b> repassed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> by a short ladder.|$|R
60|$|This {{meant that}} I {{should have been}} obliged to leave Anscombe alone, which I {{did not wish to}} do, so I just sat still <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> was {{intensely}} bored, hanging about the place and smoking more than was good for me.|$|R
