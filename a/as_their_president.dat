5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and decisions are generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their political agreements and their choice of appointments (such <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>president).</b>|$|E

After attending the Provincial Congress in Concord in April 1775, Hancock and Samuel Adams decided that it was not safe to return to Boston before leaving for Philadelphia. They stayed instead at Hancock's childhood home in Lexington.|$|E

5|$|By 3 February Zanzibar {{was finally}} {{returning}} to normality, and Karume had been widely {{accepted by the}} people <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>president.</b> A police presence {{was back on the}} streets, looted shops were re-opening, and unlicensed arms were being surrendered by the civilian populace. The revolutionary government announced that its political prisoners, numbering 500, would be tried by special courts. Okello formed the Freedom Military Force (FMF), a paramilitary unit made up of his own supporters, which patrolled the streets and looted Arab property. The behaviour of Okello's supporters, his violent rhetoric, Ugandan accent, and Christian beliefs were alienating many in the largely moderate Zanzibari and Muslim ASP, and by March many members of his FMF had been disarmed by Karume's supporters and the Umma Party militia. On 11 March Okello was officially stripped of his rank of Field Marshal, and was denied entry when trying to return to Zanzibar from a trip to the mainland. He was deported to Tanganyika and then to Kenya, before returning destitute to his native Uganda.|$|E

25|$|In April 1687, James {{ordered the}} fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford {{to elect a}} Catholic, Anthony Farmer, <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>president.</b> The fellows {{believed}} Farmer ineligible under the college's statutes and so elected John Hough instead. The college statutes required them to fill the vacancy within a certain time and so could not wait for a further royal nomination. James refused to view Hough's election as valid and told the fellows to elect the Bishop of Oxford. James responded by sending some ecclesiastical commissioners to hold a visitation and install him as president. The fellows then agreed to the Bishop of Oxford <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>president</b> but James required that they admit {{they had been in}} the wrong and ask for his pardon.

Both Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez, the leading Arab singers of the era, performed songs praising Nasser's nationalism. Others produced plays denigrating his political opponents. According to his associates, Nasser orchestrated the campaign himself.

When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led {{the rules and regulations}} committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' bases should be [...] apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the [...] "bound rule", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as outs.
