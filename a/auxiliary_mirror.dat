50|$|The TV camera {{consisted}} of a vidicon tube, 25 and 100 mm focal length lenses, shutters, polarizing filters (as opposed to color filters used on the previous Surveyor cameras), and iris mounted nearly vertically and surmounted by a mirror that could be adjusted by stepping motors to move in both azimuth and elevation. The polarizing filters served as analyzers {{for the detection of}} measurement of the linearly polarized component of light scattered from the lunar surface. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> was used for viewing the lunar surface beneath the spacecraft. The frame by frame coverage of the lunar surface provided a 360 deg azimuth view and an elevation view from approximately +90 deg above the plane normal to the camera z axis to −60 deg below this same plane. Both 600 line and 200 line modes of operation were used. The 200 line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame each 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200 line picture required 20 seconds and utilized a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. Most transmissions {{consisted of}} the 600 line pictures, which were telemetered by a directional antenna. The frames were scanned each 3.6 seconds. Each frame required nominally one second to be read from the vidicon and utilized a 220 kHz bandwidth for transmission. The optical surfaces were the cleanest of any mission because of a redesigned mirror hood. The television images were displayed on a slow scan monitor coated with a long persistence phosphor. The persistence was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame and was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder and on 70 mm film. The camera performance was excellent in terms of both {{the quantity and quality of}} pictures. Between lunar landing, lunar 'second' landing, and the lunar first day sunset on November 24, 1967, 29,914 pictures were taken and transmitted.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{overview}} of an ongoing research project that seeks to design a novel <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> drive mechanism for photo voltaic (PV) cell arrays. These auxiliary mirrors will be used with fixed PV cell arrays {{to increase the amount}} of solar radiation on the panels thereby increasing the amount of electricity generated. We present {{an overview of}} the entire system, a summary of the motion planning and control issues, and preliminary results with respect to the detailed design of the novel mirror position device. For moving the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> a spherical 5 bar mechanism called the Mirror Positioning Device has been used.

40|$|NHTSA) {{conducted}} a study of existing backover prevention technologies for light vehicles. The objective was to assess how well current, commercially-available backover prevention technologies perform in detecting objects, particularly small children. Eleven available backover avoidance technologies were identified and examined. The object detection performance of sensor-based systems was measured using a set of test objects in both static and dynamic conditions. Visual systems, including rearview camera systems and cross-view mirrors were examined to determine their field of view and subjectively estimate {{the clarity of the}} image they provide of the area behind the vehicle. Sensor-based systems generally exhibited poor ability to detect pedestrians, particularly children, located behind the vehicle. Systems ’ detection performance for children was inconsistent, unreliable, and in nearly all cases quite limited in range. Based on calculations of the distance required to stop from a particular vehicle speed, detection ranges exhibited by the systems were not sufficient to prevent many collisions with pedestrians or other objects. The rearview video systems examined had the ability to show pedestrians or obstacles behind the vehicle and provided a clear image of the area behind the vehicle in daylight and indoor lighted conditions. While the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> systems tested also displayed any rear obstacles present, their fields of view covered a smaller area behind the vehicle than did the video systems tested, and the displayed images were subject to distortion caused by mirror convexity and other factors (e. g., window tinting) making rear obstacles more difficult to recognize in the mirror. In order for visual backing systems to prevent crashes, drivers must look at the video display or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror,</b> perceive the pedestrian or obstacle, and respond correctly...|$|E

With three measurements and two nominally flat <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirrors,</b> the {{radius of curvature}} and the slope profile of a nominally flat x-ray mirror are retrieved. The height profile is then calculated through integration of the slope profile and merging this information with the radius of curvature knowledge.

Equipment on board included a television camera and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirrors,</b> a soil mechanics surface sampler, strain gauges on the spacecraft landing legs, and numerous engineering sensors. Like Surveyor 3, Surveyor 4 was also equipped with a surface claw (with a magnet in the claw) to detect and measure ferrous elements in the lunar surface.|$|R
40|$|General ways of cost {{reduction}} in solar power generation are Solar Tracked Photovoltaic (PV) arrays and concentrator systems. The PV array tracking becomes infeasible with {{increase in the}} size of the array and concentrated system is ineffective for continuous power generation as it requires external cooling system. Proposed approach here is to employ a novel <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> drive mechanism to track the sun and reflect the rays on to stationary PV arrays. The performance is compared with same PV module without reflector under the same environmental conditions. Solarex SX 38 PV module and cleardome solar reflector (96 % reflectivity) are used for the experiments.

Suggested {{modifications to the}} optical system include the introduction of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> {{in order to increase}} focal length, reduce aberrations, and expand the field of view. In this context, diffraction modelling is necessary to determine the beam pattern shape and study the polarization characteristics of the antenna. We used the aperture integration method along with the ray tracing for the calculation of the antenna beam patterns in co- and cross-polarization. Finally, the multilevel fast physical optics (PO) method was adapted for near field and beam pattern simulation of RATAN- 600 radio telescope to avoid the GO approximation of the aperture field and take the finite wavelength effects into accoun...|$|E
50|$|Surveyor 7 was {{the fifth}} and final {{spacecraft}} of the Surveyor series to achieve a lunar soft landing. The objectives for this mission were to perform a lunar soft landing (in an area well removed from the maria to provide a type of terrain photography and lunar sample significantly {{different from those of}} other Surveyor missions); obtain postlanding TV pictures; determine the relative abundances of chemical elements; manipulate the lunar material; obtain touchdown dynamics data; and obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data. This spacecraft was similar in design to the previous Surveyors, but it carried more scientific equipment including a television camera with polarizing filters, a surface sampler, bar magnets on two footpads, two horseshoe magnets on the surface scoop, and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirrors,</b> three were used to observe areas below the spacecraft, one to provide stereoscopic views of the surface sampler area, and seven to show lunar material deposited on the spacecraft. The spacecraft landed on the lunar surface on January 10, 1968, on the outer rim of the crater Tycho. Operations of the spacecraft began shortly after the soft landing and were terminated on January 26, 1968, 80 hours after sunset. On January 20, while the craft was still in daylight, the TV camera clearly saw two laser beams aimed at it from the night side of the crescent Earth, one from Kitt Peak National Observatory, Tucson, Arizona, and the other at Table Mountain at Wrightwood, California.|$|R
50|$|When using interferometry, {{a complex}} system of mirrors brings {{the light from}} the {{different}} telescopes to the astronomical instruments where it is combined and processed. This is technically demanding as the light paths must be kept equal to within 1/1000 mm over distances of a few hundred metres. For the Unit Telescopes, this gives an equivalent mirror diameter of up to 130 m, and when combining the <b>auxiliary</b> telescopes, equivalent <b>mirror</b> diameters of up to 200 m can be achieved. This is up to 25 times better than the resolution of a single VLT unit telescope.|$|R
50|$|The goal of driver {{rehabilitation}} is to aid {{individuals with}} disabilities or age-related impairments maintain independent driving and transportation. This maybe done {{through the use of}} specialized mobility equipment and training. The process begins with a clinical assessment of an individual's visual, visual-perceptual, cognitive, and physical skills that are necessary for driving. If the individual meets the criteria, an on-road assessment is conducted, in which the evaluator uses a vehicle equipped with adaptive driving equipment, as well as <b>auxiliary</b> brake and <b>mirror</b> on the passenger's side of the vehicle. Accommodations can be made via the use of mechanical or electronic steering, and acceleration and braking equipment, which are {{based on the results of}} the clinical assessment. If it is determined that the person has the potential to drive, training is offered to develop proficiency in using the mobility equipment. For novice drivers, driver's education is included in the services. Following training, a vehicle equipment prescription is provided, with a referral to a mobility equipment dealer for equipment installation. When the installation is completed, the vehicle is checked for proper fit, with additional training provided as needed.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{to test a}} surface form of the convex high-aperture {{hyperbolic}} mirrors has been developed with the secondary mirror of a telescope «Millimetron» as an example. It was proposed to use the selfsame auxiliary spherical mirror relatively small in diameter for testing the inner central part and outer part of a hyperbolic mirror. To test {{the central part of}} a hyperbolic mirror, an aberration-free points method is offered. It uses the non-traditional ray path for the secondary mirror. As a result, the overall length of interferometer measurement branch optical system is significantly reduced. Working wave front is reflected trice from the auxiliary spherical mirror surface and twice from the hyperbolic mirror under test. Double interaction of the working wave front with tested surface increases sensitivity of optical testing. The feature of the working bundle ray path is that the rays fall towards the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> once perpendicular to the surface and twice at the arbitrary angles to the surface. As a result, the homocentricity of the ray bundle is violated, i. e. the spherical aberrations arise. To compensate aberrations, a Mangin mirror compensator is used. It is placed in the central non-working zone of a hyperbolic mirror. The outer part of hyperbolic mirror is tested using the selfsame auxiliary spherical mirror according to Hindle scheme in several stages with serial imposition of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> until information about the whole surface is collected. The interferometer provides measurements recording the interferogram from each part of the surface of tested mirror. Then to obtain complete information about the mirror surface form the interferograms are united. The article presents calculation results of the optical systems for testing the hyperbolic secondary mirror of the radiotelescope «Millimetron», which has extremely high aperture. It has been shown that the auxiliary spherical mirror of 665 mm in diameter and with 500 mm radius of curvature provides testing of hyperbolic mirror of 492 mm in diameter with the aperture angle of an edge ray exceeding 90 degrees. The wave front aberration residuals of the interferometer measurement branch optical system with auto-collimation ray path make 0. 2 of He-Ne laser wavelength. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we had {{proposed}} an optically-pumped five-level Gain EIT (GEIT) system, {{which has a}} transparency dip superimposed on a gain profile and exhibits a negative dispersion suitable for the white light cavity (WLC) enhanced interferometric gravitational wave detector [Phys. Rev. D. 92, 082002 (2015) ]. Using this system as the negative dispersion medium (NDM) in the WLC-SR (signal recycling) scheme, we get an enhancement in the quantum noise (QN) limited sensitivity-bandwidth product {{by a factor of}} ~ 18. We have also shown how to realize such a system in practice using Zeeman sublevels in $^{ 87 }$Rb at 795 nm [Opt. Commun. 402, 382 - 388 (2017) ]. However, aLIGO operates at 1064 nm and suitable transitions in Rb or other alkali atoms are not available at this wavelength. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a system that is consistent with the operating wavelength of aLIGO. Here, we present the realization of such an NDM at 1064 nm with a microresonator, which supports optomechanical interaction. A strong control field is applied at a higher frequency, and, under certain conditions, a probe field at a lower frequency experiences a peak at the center of an absorption profile, and a negative dispersion in the transmission. Unlike in the GEIT case, we use the compound-cavity signal-recycling (CC-SR) scheme, where an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>mirror</b> is inserted in the dark port of the detector, and show that the enhancement factor can be as high as ~ 14. However, using the parameters required for the sensitivity enhancement, the optomechanical system enters an instability region where the control field is depleted. We present an observer based feedback control process used to stabilize the CC-SR system. Comment: 22 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
