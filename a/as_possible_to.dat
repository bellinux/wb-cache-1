5|$|After 100 years, an {{estimated}} 500,000 students have taken {{courses at the}} Extension School. Fees were kept as low <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> allow as many <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> enroll, only 0.18% have ever earned a degree. Including certificate earners, 2.5% have graduated. Today more degrees are awarded each year than were awarded in the first 50 years combined. While {{there has never been}} a formal entrance exam such as the SAT, non-native English speakers must provide designated proof of English proficiency or receive a minimum score on the TOEFL, IELTS, or PTEA. Additionally, the preadmission Expository Writing E-25 course requires students to complete E-15 with a grade of B or higher in EXPO 15 or successfully complete the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} Persian {{survivors}} had put to sea, the Athenians marched {{as quickly}} <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> Athens. They arrived in time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in Athens. Seeing his opportunity lost, Artaphernes ended the year's campaign and returned to Asia.|$|E

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> speed up construction, {{but the first}} flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay as close <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>to</b> assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit {{organization}} with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>to</b> save their stories. He continues to finance that work. Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998).|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports <b>as</b> <b>{{possible}},</b> <b>to</b> expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E
5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R as close <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps {{across the face of}} the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest {{surrendered}} on May 9 at Gainesville, Alabama. His {{troops were}} included with Taylor's. The terms stated that Taylor could retain {{control of the}} railway and river steamers {{to be able to}} get his men as near <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> their homes. Taylor stayed in Meridian, Mississippi, until the last man was sent on his way. He was paroled May 13 and then went to Mobile to join Canby. Canby took him to his home in New Orleans by boat.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} she was calling {{for the elimination of}} all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> limit the development of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October 1944 the Committee of Operations Analysts, which {{provided}} advice to USAAF commanders on suitable strategic bombardment targets, recommended that photo reconnaissance flights be conducted over Japan's main industrial areas as soon <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> provide intelligence {{which could be}} used to direct raids from the Mariana Islands.

5|$|On 4 June, as per the agreement, all U.S. and Thai {{personnel}} {{left the}} country, leaving 50–60,000 PAVN troops still ensconced within Laos. The previous month an airlift had begun at Long Tieng which evacuated {{as many of}} the Hmong <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> Thailand. They were soon followed by approximately 40,000 others who set out on foot for exile. On 2 December 1975 the coalition government and the monarchy were abolished by the provisional government, which then disestablished itself. The Lao People's Democratic Republic then came into existence.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge as quickly <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E
