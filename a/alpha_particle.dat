5|$|Alpha decay: {{this process}} is caused when the nucleus emits an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle,</b> which is a helium nucleus {{consisting}} of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower atomic number.|$|E
5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, Rutherford and his {{assistant}} William Kay began exploring the passage of <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> through gases such as hydrogen and nitrogen. In an experiment where they shot a beam of <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> through hydrogen, the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> knocked the hydrogen nuclei forwards {{in the direction of}} the beam, not backwards. In an experiment where they shot <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> through nitrogen, he discovered that the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> knocked hydrogen nuclei (i.e. protons) out of the nitrogen nuclei.|$|R
50|$|The {{energy of}} <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> emitted varies, with higher energy <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> being emitted from larger nuclei, but most <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> have {{energies}} of {{between 3 and 7}} MeV (mega-electron-volts), corresponding to extremely long and extremely short half-lives of alpha-emitting nuclides, respectively.|$|R

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), {{uranium-235}} (0.7198–0.7202%), {{and a very}} small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle.</b> The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating {{the age of the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through nasal swabs of onsite personnel. Of the 9,837 nasal swabs taken, 335 samples had detectable {{levels of}} <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> activity, although none was above acceptable levels. Urinalysis was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle,</b> was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{heaviest}} nuclei, starting with tellurium nuclei (element 52) containing 106 or more nucleons, electric forces {{may be so}} destabilizing that entire chunks of the nucleus may be ejected, usually as <b>alpha</b> <b>particles,</b> which consist of two protons and two neutrons (<b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are fast helium nuclei). (Beryllium-8 also decays, very quickly, into two <b>alpha</b> <b>particles.)</b> <b>Alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are extremely stable. This type of decay {{becomes more and more}} probable as elements rise in atomic weight past 106.|$|R
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> at thin sheets {{of metal and}} {{measured}} their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles,</b> and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> so strongly.|$|R
50|$|The {{energy stored}} in the angular {{momentum}} of an atomic nucleus can also {{be responsible for the}} emission of larger-than-expected <b>particles,</b> such as <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> over single nucleons, because they can carry away angular momentum more effectively. This is not the only reason <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are preferentially emitted, though; another reason is simply that <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> (He-4 nuclei) are energetically very stable in and of themselves.|$|R
5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 may be {{quantified}} in biological specimens by <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> spectrometry to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally {{in a range of}} 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide.|$|E
5|$|The most {{practical}} application of 244Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle {{source in the}} <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> X-ray spectrometers (APXS). These instruments were installed on the Sojourner, Mars, Mars 96, Mars Exploration Rovers and Philae comet lander, {{as well as the}} Mars Science Laboratory to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet Mars. APXS was also used in the Surveyor 5–7 moon probes but with a 242Cm source.|$|E

No dependence of CdWO 4 pulse shape on emission spectrum wavelengths under laser, <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> and gamma ray excitation was observed. Dependence of scintillation pulse shape for gamma quanta and <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> and pulse-shape discrimination ability on temperature was measured in the range of 0 - 24 degrees.

50|$|Rutherford's {{work also}} {{included}} {{measurements of the}} ratio of an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle's</b> mass to its charge, which {{led him to the}} hypothesis that <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> were doubly charged helium ions (later shown to be bare helium nuclei). In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds finally proved that <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> were indeed helium ions. To do this they allowed <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> to penetrate a very thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, thus capturing a large number of the hypothesized helium ions inside the tube. They then caused an electric spark inside the tube, which provided a shower of electrons that were taken up by the ions to form neutral atoms of a gas. Subsequent study of the spectra of the resulting gas showed that it was helium and that the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> were indeed the hypothesized helium ions.|$|R

5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Curium-244 decays into 240Pu by {{emission}} of <b>alpha</b> <b>particle,</b> {{but it also}} absorbs neutrons resulting in {{a small amount of}} heavier curium isotopes. Among those, 247Cm and 248Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of 247Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of 250Cm via neutron absorption is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product 249Cm (64 min), which converts by β− decay to the berkelium isotope 249Bk.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{forms of}} {{radiation}} {{are used in}} APXS.

5000|$|In nuclear physics, the Geiger-Nuttall law or Geiger-Nuttall rule {{relates the}} decay {{constant}} of a radioactive isotope {{with the energy}} of the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> emitted. Roughly speaking, it states that short-lived isotopes emit more energetic <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> than long-lived ones.|$|R
50|$|Now in Italy, Enrico Fermi - nicknamed ‘the pope’ by {{his colleagues}} for his infallibility, {{realised}} {{the potential of}} the newly discovered neutron in the search for elements heavier than uranium. Until now, scientists had been bombarding uranium with <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> in the hope they would enter the nucleus. Unfortunately, this was very unlikely because both <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> and nuclei are positively charged - the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> could never overcome the electrostatic repulsion of the nucleus.|$|R
5|$|Of the ten other {{isotopes}} produced synthetically, {{ranging from}} 12N to 23N, 13N has a half-life of ten minutes {{and the remaining}} isotopes have half-lives {{on the order of}} seconds (16N and 17N) or even milliseconds. No other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the nuclear drip lines, leaking out a proton or neutron. Given the half-life difference, 13N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in positron emission tomography (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of 16O producing 13N and an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the world's first artificial cell was made by Thomas Chang while an undergraduate student at the university. While chair of physics at McGill, nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford performed the experiment {{that led to the}} discovery of the <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> and its function in radioactive decay, which won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. Alumnus Jack W. Szostak was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering a key mechanism in the genetic operations of cells, an insight that has inspired new lines of research into cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes {{start from}} 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle.</b> The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. The net result yields a trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. 21Ne {{may also be}} produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.|$|E
2500|$|Geiger and Marsden then {{wanted to}} {{estimate}} {{the total number of}} <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> that were being reflected. [...] The previous setup was unsuitable for doing this because the tube contained several radioactive substances (radium plus its decay products) and thus the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> emitted had varying ranges, and because it was difficult for them to ascertain at what rate the tube was emitting <b>alpha</b> <b>particles.</b> [...] This time, they placed a small quantity of radium C (bismuth-214) on the lead plate, which bounced off a platinum reflector (R) and onto the screen. [...] They found that {{only a tiny fraction of}} the <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> that struck the reflector bounced onto the screen (in this case, 1 in 8000).|$|R
50|$|Solid state nuclear track {{detectors}} (SSNTD) {{insensitive to}} <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> and magnetic spectrometers in which <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are deflected {{by a strong}} magnetic field {{have been used to}} overcome this difficulty. SSNTD are cheap and handy but they need chemical etching and microscope scanning.|$|R
50|$|In {{analysing}} {{the nature}} of the decay products, it was obvious {{from the direction of the}} electromagnetic forces applied to the radiations by external magnetic and electric fields that <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> carried a positive charge, beta particles carried a negative charge, and gamma rays were neutral. From the magnitude of deflection, it was clear that <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> were much more massive than beta <b>particles.</b> Passing <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the captured particles, and ultimately proved that <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are helium nuclei. Other experiments showed beta radiation, resulting from decay and cathode rays, were high-speed electrons. Likewise, gamma radiation and X-rays were found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation.|$|R
5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) {{can all be}} produced by bombarding actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon). The two most important isotopes, 256Lr and 260Lr, are both in this range. 256Lr can be produced by bombarding californium-249 with 70MeV boron-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four neutrons), while 260Lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium-249 with oxygen-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an <b>alpha</b> <b>particle,</b> and three neutrons).|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of work, Fermi's group had {{tentatively}} determined that lighter elements would disperse {{the energy of the}} captured neutron by emitting a proton or <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a gamma ray. This latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton, thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table. When Fermi's team bombarded uranium, they observed this behavior as well, which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of 93. Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim, but after his team observed several unknown half-lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope, he published a paper entitled Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 in June 1934. In it he proposed the name ausonium (atomic symbol Ao) for element 93, after the Greek name Ausonia (Italy).|$|E

In 1928, Pettersson asked her to analyze a sample of sea bottom sediment to determine its radium content. Because the lab she was working in was contaminated, she took the samples to the oceanographic laboratory at Bornö Marine Research Station on Stora Bornö in Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden, which would become her summer research destination for the next 12 years. Her analyses with Berta Karlik on the half-lives of uranium, thorium, and actinium decay identified radiometric dating and elemental <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> ranges.
