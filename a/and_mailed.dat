5|$|The {{popularity}} of the novel extended to Ukraine, where a baroness named Ewelina Hańska read about Balzac's novels in newspapers she received from Paris. Intrigued, she ordered copies of his work, and she read them with her cousins and friends around Volhynia. They were impressed by the understanding he showed toward women in La Physiologie du mariage, but felt that La Peau de chagrin portrayed them in a cruel and unforgiving light. Hańska {{wrote a letter to}} Balzac, signed it as L'Étrangère ("The Stranger"), <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> it from Odessa on 28 February 1832.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} fell briefly under British rule {{during the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata. There was looting after the failed resistance, and Alberti hid all the valuable {{things from the}} half-built parish. In defiance of the new British rule, Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased, <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city. As a result, he was jailed. He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices (the invaders {{did not attempt to}} enforce Protestantism in the population), but under military escort. The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers, and driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of Szilárd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szilárd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For Szilárd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> it to Einstein.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Mark Finch was boyishly charming and often masked his private {{depression}} with public bonhomie. His gently camp affectation would occasionally dissolve into tantrum socially but such outbursts {{were not part}} of his professional life, which was characterised by lively industry, incisive wit and a passionate affability. He delighted in wordplay and inventive imagery; he never stopped writing absurd narratives, and sharp observations of his surroundings. Such commentaries were sent to friends in small packages with brief covering notes or topped and tailed with the greetings and codas of more formal letters. Soon after his birthday each year after his first arrival in London he would often create an inventive calendar collage for the coming year. Similar publications became commercial products in the mid-1990s but Finch's creations were obviously amateur and intensely personal. They were photocopied, spiral-bound <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> to friends as pre-Christmas gifts.|$|E
25|$|Section 971 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} proxy access and shareholders' ability to {{nominate}} candidates for director positions in public companies.

In the past, activist investors had to pay to have materials prepared <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> to other investors in order to solicit their help on issues. Any shareholder group that has held at least three percent of voting shares {{for a period of}} at least three years is entitled to make director nominations. However, shareholder groups may not nominate more than twenty five percent of a company's board and may always nominate at least one member even if that one nomination would represent over twenty five percent of the board. If multiple shareholder groups make nominations then the nominations from groups with the most voting power will be considered first with additional nominations being considered up to the twenty five percent cap.|$|E

25|$|After serving {{aboard the}} Sterling for 11 months, Cooper joined the United States Navy on January 1, 1808, when he {{received}} his commission as a midshipman. Cooper had conducted himself well as a sailor, and his father, a former U.S. Congressman, easily secured a commission for him through his long-standing connections with politicians and naval officials. The warrant for Cooper's commission as midshipman was signed by President Jefferson <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> by Naval Secretary Robert Smith, reaching Cooper on February 19. Along with the warrant was a copy of naval rules and regulations, {{a description of the}} required naval uniform, along with an oath that Cooper was to sign in front of a witness and to be returned with his letter of acceptance. Cooper signed the oath and had it notarized by New York attorney William Williams, Jr., who had previously certified the Sterling's crew. After Williams had confirmed Cooper's signature, Cooper mailed the document to Washington. On February 24, he received orders to report to the naval commander at New York City. Joining the United States Navy fulfilled an aspiration Cooper had had since his youth.|$|E

500|$|Gibbs {{published}} his first work in 1873. His {{papers on the}} geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy.

[...] Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge. [...] Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct. [...] He then produced two plaster casts of his model <b>and</b> <b>mailed</b> one to Gibbs.
