40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} delay element using C 4 band-pass filter for subband analog tapped-delay adaptive filter, where implementation of larger group delay is required. Most analog delay elements have been imple-mented with low-pass or all-pass filters. While they can easily achieve constant group delay within pass band, max-imum group delay is severely restricted by the corner fre-quency because group delay is inversely proportional to the corner frequency. In this paper, we implemented a delay element with a Capacitively-Coupled Current Conveyer (C 4) band-pass fil-ter to produce larger group delay required for <b>analog</b> <b>sub-band</b> adaptive filter. Experimental results from circuits fab-ricated in 0. 5 Âµm CMOS technology through MOSIS are also presented...|$|E
