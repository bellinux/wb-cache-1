40|$|In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of alumo-chrome catalyst on the properties and structure of <b>anhydrite</b> <b>binder</b> by means of mechanical tests, X-ray phase analysis and raster electron microscopy was investigated. Taking into account the high dispersity {{in the presence of}} alumina in the amorphous state, the catalyst intensifies the solidification of anhydrite composition increasing the mechanical strength by 80 – 100 %. The catalyst also influences on the morphology and size of gypsum crystals. The addition of the catalyst in the range of 2 – 5 % leads to the formation compact fine-grained structure, it allows increasing the mechanical properties of <b>anhydrite</b> <b>binder...</b>|$|E

40|$|While {{dehydrating}} gypsum with additives at {{the temperatures}} of 800 °C and 900 °C {{the influence of}} alkali additives on both the crystalline structure of anhydrite and properties of <b>anhydrite</b> <b>binder</b> was investigated. The industrial and household wastes including other lowcost materials were used as additives. Having heated them with gypsum the anhydrite with alkali activation properties was obtained. The properties of such substances were evaluated using the methods of chemical, diffractive X-ray scanning and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Some additives, e. g. 5 % ground glass waste, were found to increase crystal agglomerate formation of <b>anhydrite</b> <b>binder,</b> accelerate the hydration process of anhydrite and double the compressive strength of hydrated samples compared to samples without additives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this experimental work was to monitor the influence of applied external exciter on anhydrite obtained properties. As a basic raw material anhydrite imported from Poland was used, as hydration exciter a mixture of anhydrous sodium sulphate and Portland cement CEM I 42. 5 R in total dose of 5 % by anhydrite weight was applied. In the first step the anhydrite underwent the setting of mineralogical composition using the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and monitoring of grain size and shape by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the next step the influence of applied mixing exciter on obtained basic technological properties according to standard CSN EN 13454 was monitored. It was the setting of basic technological properties of <b>anhydrite</b> <b>binder</b> with and without addition of the mixing external exciter and also the setting of strengths of standard anhydrite mortar with addition of external mixing exciter. Upon the obtained values the comparison with technical requirements of the standard for calcium sulphate binders was carried out and this anhydrite mortar was classified as well...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} batch control of {{granular}} materials in production of building materials from fluorine anhydrite. Batching equipment {{is intended for}} smooth operation and timely feeding of supply hoppers at a required level. Level sensors and a controller of an asynchronous screw drive motor are used to control filling of the hopper with industrial <b>anhydrite</b> <b>binders.</b> The controller generates a required frequency and ensures required productivity of a feed conveyor. Mamdani-type fuzzy inference is proposed for controlling {{the speed of the}} screw that feeds mixture components. As related to production of building materials based on fluoride anhydrite, this method is used for the first time. A fuzzy controller is proven to be effective in controlling the filling level of the supply hopper. In addition, the authors determined optimal parameters of the batching process to ensure smooth operation and production of fluorine anhydrite materials of specified properties that can compete with gypsum-based products...|$|R
