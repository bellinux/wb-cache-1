In 2001, a plebiscite in the ARMM confirmed the previous composition of the <b>autonomous</b> <b>region</b> and added Basilan (except {{for the city of}} Isabela) and Marawi City in Lanao del Sur. Isabela City remains a part of the province of Basilan despite rejecting inclusion in the ARMM. A Cordillera <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> has never been formed because no plebiscite has received the required support.|$|R
