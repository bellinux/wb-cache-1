5|$|Jazz is a {{genre of}} music from the United States which reached Barbados {{by the end of}} the 1920s. The first major {{performer}} from the island was Lionel Gittens, who was followed by Percy Green, Maggie Goodridge and Clevie Gittens. These bandleaders played a variety of music, including swing, a kind of pop-jazz, Barbadian calypso and waltzes. With little recorded music on the island, radio broadcasts such as Willis Conover's Voice of America had a major influence. In 1937, riots over poverty and disenfranchisement occurred, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Clement Payne had risen to fame advocating reform. In that year, Payne was deported and riots broke out in Bridgetown, spreading throughout the island. The following year, the Barbados Labour Party was formed by C. A. Braithwaite and Grantley Adams.|$|E
25|$|Opportunities for leisure {{activities}} increased dramatically as real wages {{continued to grow}} and hours of work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the Bank Holiday Act of 1871, which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class. Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays. Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside, Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Brighton, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centres, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Thomas Cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses.|$|E

500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind.

500|$|Naser Khader, a Muslim Danish MP, founded an {{organisation}} called Democratic Muslims in Denmark {{in response}} to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because [...] "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united {{and that there is a}} real difference between the Islamists <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." [...] He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's {{all the same}} shit, man, {{and you can do}} it.'" [...] Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, [...] was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. [...] "Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four." [...] Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R artists, said it [...] "seemed the most real thing" [...] he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the [...] "most powerful music [...] ever heard... the most expressive." [...] He also stated, [...] "when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and {{there were a lot of}} us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very... heartwarming".|$|E

2500|$|... "Platonism" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} {{scholars}} {{to refer to the}} intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the Republic, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the Theaetetus, he says such people are eu amousoi (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, [...] "happily without the muses" [...] (Theaetetus 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> him, access to higher insights about reality.|$|E

However, learning to play instruments in school wasn't satisfying to Lee, and he took basic piano lessons on his own. His interest increased dramatically after listening {{to some of the}} popular rock groups at the time. His early influences included Jack Bruce of Cream, John Entwistle of The Who, Jeff Beck, and Procol Harum. [...] "I was mainly interested in early British progressive rock," [...] said Lee. [...] "That's how I learned to play bass, emulating Jack Bruce <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> that."

2500|$|On April 12, 2006, Turner had a {{physical}} altercation with Jaime Vazquez, a former Jersey City Deputy Mayor {{and a member}} of the Jersey City Council, who was the Jersey City Commissioner of Veterans Affairs at the time.

[...] In response, Vazquez picketed with a sign reading [...] "Hal Turner — shoot me! Racists and bigots like you are cowards." [...] This was followed by {{a physical}} confrontation, during which Vazquez suffered a back injury and a fractured wrist. Turner and Vazquez later filed criminal charges against each other. On July 16, 2006 North Bergen Municipal Court Judge Joseph Romano found both men to be equally credible and thus neither criminally liable.|$|E
2500|$|In Larsson's final {{match for}} Barcelona, his {{substitute}} introduction was pivotal {{to win the}} 2006 Champions League final. Larsson assisted both of Barcelona's goals in a 2–1 win over Arsenal. Thierry Henry paid tribute to Larsson's contribution to Barcelona's win after the match, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Ludovic Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Indeed, his ability to give Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by the international press. In 2005–06, Larsson scored ten goals as Barcelona won La Liga for a second consecutive year.|$|E

[...] McCollum wrote in 2007: [...] "Our attorneys handling this case have searched long and hard for other expert witnesses with comparable expertise to Dr. Rekers and have been unable to identify any who would be available for this case." [...] However, his choice of witness was criticized by Nadine Smith of the gay-rights organization Equality Florida: [...] "Rekers is part of a small cadre of bogus pseudo scientists that charge these exorbitant fees to peddle information they know has been discredited time and time again. <b>And</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> McCollum will pay top dollar for it.
