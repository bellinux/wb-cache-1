When exploring marine electromagnetic <b>field</b> by underwater <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> sensors,the underwater <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> sensor calibration traceability of the underwater <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> directly affects the final research significance. Therefore,the underwater <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> sensor calibration traceability technique is very important.

In this paper {{the effects of}} these differences on <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in the presence of foreign metallic particle in three-phase GIS are reported. The <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> characteristic in three-phase GIS is different from that in single-phase one. There are periodic changes in the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> magnitude and direction produced by three-phase voltage at any point. While the voltage phase varies, the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> vector changes and rotates continuously. The rotating characteristics of the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> vector in three-phase power apparatus depended on the position inside the insulation of the tank. The <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> vector locus is circular, elliptic, or linear. The elliptical nature of rotating <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is expressed as <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> ratio.
