500|$|The {{deployment}} of Jupiter IRBMs to Italy and Turkey in 1961 {{led to the}} Soviet Union responding by attempting to deploy IRBMs in Cuba. Their discovery by the United States led to the Cuban Missile Crisis. SAC was placed on DEFCON 3 on 22 October 1962, and DEFCON 2 on 24 October. RAF Bomber Command moved to <b>Alert</b> <b>Condition</b> 3, equivalent to DEFCON 3, on 27 October. Normally between 45 and 50 Thor missiles were ready to fire in 15 minutes. Without altering the <b>alert</b> <b>condition,</b> the number of missiles ready to fire in 15 minutes was increased to 59, the only exception being a missile used for training at RAF Feltwell. The dual key system was thereby put under strain due to the RAF and USAF personnel being on different states of readiness. Under the war plan that had gone into effect on 1 August 1962, the RAF's bombers and Thor missiles targeted 16 cities, 44 airfields, 10 air defence control centres and 20 IRBM sites. [...] The crisis passed, and SAC reverted to DEFCON 3 on 21 November and DEFCON 4 on 24 November. In {{the aftermath of the}} crisis, RAF Bomber Command ordered that in future 39 missiles would be on 15 minute readiness, with the Feltwell station maintaining nine on alert and the other three stations keeping ten.|$|E

40|$|The {{deleterious}} effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on behavior and cognition are a concern in modern society. Persons {{at risk for}} impaired performance and health-related issues resulting from prolonged sleep loss would benefit from agents capable of reducing these detrimental effects {{at the time they}} are sleep deprived. Agents capable of improving cognition by enhancing brain activity under normal circumstances may also have the potential to reduce the harmful or unwanted effects of sleep deprivation. The significant prevalence of excitatory a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamatergic receptors in the brain provides a basis for implementing a class of drugs that could act to alter or remove the effects of sleep deprivation. The ampakine CX 717 (Cortex Pharmaceuticals), a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, was tested for its ability to enhance performance of a cognitive, delayed match-to-sample task under normal circumstances in well-trained monkeys, as well as alleviate the detrimental effects of 30 – 36 h of sleep deprivation. CX 717 produced a dose-dependent enhancement of task performance under normal <b>alert</b> testing <b>conditions.</b> Concomitant measures of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMR glc) during the task, utilizing positron emission tomography, revealed increased activity in prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus) that was significantly enhanced over normal <b>alert</b> <b>conditions</b> following administration of CX 717.

3000|$|A common {{approach}} when studying driver sleepiness {{is to use}} sleep deprived drivers [18 – 20]. Usually, the drivers are in an <b>alert</b> <b>condition</b> during daytime and in a sleep deprived condition during night-time.

In addition, there is also an effect of fatigue-related factors such as time on task and boredom. The consequences of driving under this mixture of causal factors are heavily understudied in the research literature. For example, is a driver more likely crash during the night-time compared to daytime, when the sleepiness level being experienced is the same in the two conditions? [...]...|$|E

40|$|Creation and {{maintenance}} of electronic clinical alerts within a hospital's electronic medical record (EMR) or database poses a number of challenges. Development can require significant programming effort. Final testing should ideally be performed in a real clinical environment without clinician notification, which may create technical challenges.

Changes may be required in the knowledge base utilized by the alert or in {{the presentation of the}} <b>alert</b> <b>condition</b> to the clinicians. Occasionally, different users within the clinical environment may wish to have the same alert data presented differently.

Some elements of this scheme may be appropriate for incorporation into clinical alerting standards...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{estimation}} of fatigue level within individual operators using voice analysis. One advantage of voice analysis is its utilization of already existing operator communications hardware (2 -way radio). From the driver viewpoint it’s an unobtrusive, non-interfering, secondary task. The expected fatigue induced speech changes {{refer to the}} voice categories of intensity, rhythm, pause patterns, intonation, speech rate, articulation, and speech quality. Due to inter-individual differences in speech pattern we recorded speaker dependent baselines under <b>alert</b> <b>conditions.</b> Furthermore, sophisticated classification tools (e. g. Support Vector Machine, Multi-Layer Perceptron) were applied to distinguish these different fatigue clusters. To validate the voice analysis predetermined speech samples gained from a driving simulator based sleep deprivation study (N= 12; 01. 00 - 08. 00 a. m.) are used. Using standard acoustic feature computation procedures we selected 1748 features and fed them into 8 machine learning methods.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the relation between}} neural activity reflecting early face perception processes and automatic and controlled re-sponses to race. Participants completed a sequential evaluative priming task, in which two-tone images of Black faces, White faces, and cars appeared as primes, followed by target words categorized as pleasant or unpleasant, while encephalography was recorded. Half of these participants were alerted that the task assessed racial prejudice and could reveal their personal bias (“alerted ” condition). To assess face perception processes, the N 170 component of the ERP was examined. For all participants, stronger automatic pro-White bias was associated with larger N 170 amplitudes to Black than White faces. For participants in the <b>alerted</b> <b>condition</b> only, larger N 170 amplitudes to Black ver-sus White faces were also associated with less controlled pro-cessing on the word categorization task. These findings suggest that preexisting racial attitudes affect early face processing and that situational factors moderate the link between early face pro-cessing and behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|Interruptions are pervasive; rarely can one {{work for}} an {{extended}} period of time without being interrupted. One method for reducing the disruptiveness of interruptions is to present an alert prior to the interruption. Based on the Memory for Goals theory (Altmann and Trafton, 2002), this alert period provides an opportunity to maintain an associative link between the suspended primary task goal and relevant environmental cues which facilitates resumption. This theory does not, however, describe what types of alerts are most effective. Using reaction time and eye movement measures, three different types of alerts were examined to determine which alerts were the most effective and to determine which afforded the greatest opportunity to form an associative link between the suspended primary task goal and relevant environmental cues. Alert conditions resulted in faster resumption times than a no <b>alert</b> <b>condition.</b> There were no differences between the alert conditions themselves, despite eye movement differences reflecting cue association processes. The eye movement data suggest that one fixation is enough to form an associative link which reduces the disruptiveness of interruptions...|$|E
