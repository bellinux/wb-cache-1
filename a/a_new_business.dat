5|$|The {{community}} became wealthier and, {{following a}} royal provision by Queen Mary I in 1791, {{the inspector general}} Almada reorganized the town's layout, a new civic center with a monumental city hall, streets and infrastructure were built, all of which provided potential for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> — sea baths.|$|E

In many of ENO's lighter shows, {{the size of the}} Coliseum has been a problem, both in putting across pieces written for much more intimate theatres and in selling enough tickets. In 2015 <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> plan for ENO included making money from a West End musical partnership with the impresarios Michael Grade and Michael Linnit.|$|E

In 1867 Lilly found work at the Harrison Daily and Company, a wholesale drug firm. In 1869 he began working for Patterson, Moore and Talbott, another medicinal wholesale company, before he moved to Illinois to establish <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business.</b> In 1869 Lilly left Indiana to open a drugstore with James W.

5|$|The I-75/US10/US23 freeway was {{completed}} between Saginaw and Bay City in late 1960 or early 1961; M-47 was relocated {{to the former}} US10 between Saginaw and Midland, and M-84 was redesignated along the former M-47 between M-81 at Saginaw and the freeway in Bay City. A new BL I-75 was created {{at the same time}} along the former M-47 in Bay City. This business loop would be split in half in 1971 resulting in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> spur; M-84 was extended over the southern section between M-25 and I-75/US10/US 23.|$|E

When <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> {{management}} team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business saddled with debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E

In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes some of the office staff on a field trip to Gettysburg for inspiration. Meanwhile, the rest of the office, under orders from Robert California (James Spader), are tasked with coming up with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> idea for Dunder Mifflin. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) proposes several vending machine ideas that capture California's imagination.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a parachutist would. The dolls were produced in a New York factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dolls—toy dolls with blank faces that could be individually decorated by children—which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had left over from the closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E
5|$|An Ideal World, {{authored}} by Weidong Chen {{and illustrated by}} Chao Peng, was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company and entitled Seek Self's World. It {{is part of the}} company's Cunren Fairy Tale series. An Ideal World was licensed by the French manhua company Xiao Pan, as well as several other companies, which released it in five volumes entitled Un Monde Idéal ("An Ideal World") from September 15, 2006 to March 14, 2007. Contracts were made that allowed for the French, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese companies to release the five volumes {{at the same time as}} the original company; French, Chinese, and Korean language editions were published through a partnership with Beijing Total Vision Culture Spreads. An Ideal Worlds global release was meant to aid in the development of the Chinese comic industry and create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> model, and its release marked the first simultaneous global release for a comic. Xiao Pan also made an omnibus of the original Chinese version available for purchase.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business,</b> Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} department {{in charge of}} the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison. Since 1991, the prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site on state, national, and World Heritage lists, and various restoration works have been undertaken since the 1990s. New uses have been found for various sections of the prison, including <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>Business</b> Enterprise Centre in the New Division cell block, and wedding ceremonies in the prison chapels. It has also become a significant tourist attraction, with guided tours since 1991.|$|E
5|$|The routing of US-64 was {{modified}} further on July 6, 1965, {{through the city}} of Enid. The routing of US-64 Bypass, which was designated two years earlier, was replaced by that of US-64 itself, and {{what used to be}} US-64 became part of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>business</b> loop (US-64 Bus.) through the city. The Oklahoma Department of Highways approved a rerouting of the designation onto a freeway south of Muskogee on October 3, 1966, and a relocation slightly to the north between Jamesville and Muskogee on July 10, 1967. However, neither of these modifications was completed until around 1969. Then, on June 1, 1970, US-64 was relocated across the Arkansas River between Webber Falls and Gore. Between then and 1972, US-64 was realigned between Enid and Perry, with the old highway becoming SH-164.|$|E
