His innovations in schematic organization of pitch, rhythm, register, timbre, dynamics, articulation, and melodic contour; his eagerness to redefine imitative contrapuntal techniques such as canon and fugue; and his inclination toward <b>athematicism,</b> abstraction, and lyricism all greatly informed and oriented intra- and post-war European, typically serial or avant-garde composers such as Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Henri Pousseur, and György Ligeti. In the United States, meanwhile, his music attracted the interest of Elliott Carter, whose critical ambivalence was marked by a certain enthusiasm nonetheless; Milton Babbitt, who ultimately derived more inspiration from Schoenberg's twelve-tone practice than that of Webern; and Igor Stravinsky, to whom it was very fruitfully reintroduced by Robert Craft.|$|E
50|$|In July 1923 at {{the festival}} of modern music in Donaueschingen, the Amar-Hindemith Quartet played Hába’s quarter-tone String Quartet No. 3. His name began to appear {{alongside}} other representatives of his generation’s avant-garde musicians and, thanks to him, Czechoslovakia {{became one of the}} first member countries of the International Society for Contemporary Music. Hába wrote several theoretical articles on microtonality, <b>athematicism,</b> and church modes at this time. In 1925 he wrote his major theoretical work New Harmony-Textbook of the Diatonic, Chromatic, Quarter-, Third-, Sixth-, and Twelfth-tone Systems (if necessary, see: diatonic, chromatic). He designed and had built two quarter-tone pianos by early 1924 and a third in 1925. In 1927, the Czech branch factory of the German piano firm August Förster in the North Bohemian town of Jiříkov built for him a sixth-tone harmonium, patterned mostly after the design by Busoni.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} this topic, it was first necessary to discuss certain problems of terminology and periodisation relating to musical modernism in general. It is already familiar {{the extent to which}} the terms "new music", "modernist", "contemporary" and "avant-garde" music have been used interchangeably, as synonyms. For this reason, it was first important to outline the period of musical modernism as almost generally accepted, which is regarded as an epoch comprising three different periods: (I) period of early modernism (1890 – 1918), announced by a break with later romanticism and a turn towards French Impressionism, Austro-German Expressionism and Russian "folkloric Expressionism"; (II) period of "classical modernism"(1919 – 1945) that witnessed a diffusion of neo-classicism and serialism; (III) period of "high modernism" (1946 – 1972) characterized by highly experimental compositional techniques such as integral serialism and aleatoricism. In relation to this, avant-garde movements are seen as radically innovative and subversive tendencies within this modernist epoch, and while certain postmodernist ideas can be recognized as early as the 1950 s, postmodernism as a movement hadn’t gained its full potency until the 1970 s. Since then, it has assumed different forms of existence as well as having assimilated a continued form of ‘modernist project’. The second part of the article proposes a periodisation of Serbian musical modernism, which is divided into four stages. The first stage (1908 – 1945) was a period where elements of Impressionism and German expressionism were creatively introduced into the works of several leading composers (Petar Konjović, Stevan Hristić, Miloje Milojević, Josip Slavenski, Marko Tajčević). The second stage (1929 – 1945) was marked by a group of composers who studied in Prague and assimilated certain progressive compositional techniques such as free tonality, atonality dodecaphony, microtonality and <b>athematicism</b> (Mihovil Logar, Predrag Milošević, Dragutin Čolić, Ljubica Marić, Vojislav Vučković, Milan Ristić). The third stage (1951 – 1970) followed immediately after the era of Socialist Realism, which involved the rediscovery of the pre- World War II Western modernism and prepared the ground for contemporary avant-garde developments almost non-existent before 1961 (Milan Ristić, Dušan Radić, Dejan Despić Vladan Radovanović, Enriko Josif, Stanojlo Rajičić, Vasilije Mokranjac Aleksandar Obradović, Ljubica Marić, Rajko Maksimović). The fourth stage (1956 – 1980) was the period during which the post-World War II avant-garde developments found their home amongst Serbian composers, some of them conceived almost simultaneously with but independent of the current progressive development in the rest of the world (Vladan Radovanović Aleksandar Obradović, Petar Ozgijan, Petar Bergamo, Srdjan Hofman, the group Opus 4) ...|$|E
