The genus comprises two cushion-forming, mucilaginous species. They are found at high elevation habitats of <b>Andean</b> <b>Argentina</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chile.</b>|$|E

40|$|Volcanic {{monitoring}} {{by remote}} sensing techniques allows to predict volcano behavior in large areas as the <b>Andean</b> Range between <b>Argentina</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chile.</b> Surface temperatures, {{digital elevation model}} for topographic and geomorphologic analysis, volcanic products mapping, estimation of SO 2 contents, drift velocity and altitude of volcanic plumes could be estimated using ASTER data. Brightness temperature was calculated by processing L 1 B (radiance at sensor) SWIR and TIR nighttime images from april 2000. Emissivity and absolute temperature images was obtained by processing L 1 A (raw data) TIR daytime data using Temperature and Emissivity Separation Algorithm. VNIR and SWIR bands was used for spectral classification (Spectral Angle Mapper) of volcanic products. TIR bands allows rock discrimination and qualitative analysis of SO 2 by using spectral ratios developed by the ASTER Science Team. At {{the end of the}} first stage of the project development, the brightness temperature of Lascar volcano, which has an exogenous dome, was calculated and some of it volcanic products were mapped. Also there were obtained absolute temperature and emissivity images of Putana, Láscar, Chiliques, Lastarria (<b>Chile)</b> <b>and</b> Copahue (<b>Argentina)</b> volcanoes. Pages: 465 - 47...|$|R
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} was revised in 1989 by an academic paper published in the [...] of the American Museum of Natural History. In 1997, researchers from the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Rio Negro, Argentina collected larvae of G. marginalis and other fly species in Lanin National Park, Neuquén Province. After a close examination included chromosome mapping, they reported:Females are not anthropophilic {{and can be found}} as well as in mountain creeks from sea level to 4,700 m of altitude (Wygodzinsky & Coscaron 1989). Gigantodax is a peculiar genus, showing the greatest diversity among the Prosimuliini genera, with synapomorphies in imago and preimaginal stages that help to differentiate species in this genus from other genera. The unusual morphology of the respiratory filaments in the pupal stage is useful in differentiating species.These South American researchers also analyzed G. marginalis, G. fulvescens, and G. chilensis and reported that Cnesia, another Prosimuliini genus, is sympatric with southern populations of Gigantodax and that both genera breed {{on both sides of the}} <b>Andean</b> range in <b>Argentina</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chile</b> in subantarctic Patagonia. They also reported that Gigantodax species in this area are also sympatric with Simulium.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{possible}} consequences of biological invasions is the decrease of native species abundances or their replacement by non-native species. In <b>Andean</b> Patagonia, southern <b>Argentina</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chile,</b> many non-native animals have been introduced and are currently spreading. On Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park, many non-native vertebrates were introduced ca. 1937. Records indicate that several native vertebrates were present before these species were introduced. We hypothesize that seven decades after the introduction of non-native species and without appropriate management to maintain native diversity, non-native vertebrates have displaced native species (given the known invasiveness and impacts {{of some of the}} introduced species). We conducted direct censuses in linear transects 500 m long (n = 10) in parallel with camera-trapping (1, 253 camera-days) surveys in two regions of the island with different levels of disturbance: high (n = 4) and low (n = 6) to study the community of terrestrial mammals and birds and the relative abundances of native and non-native species. Results show that currently non-native species are dominant across all environments; 60. 4 % of census records and 99. 7 % of camera trapping records are of non-native animals. We detected no native large mammals; the assemblage of large vertebrates consisted of five non-native mammals and one non-native bird. Native species detected were one small mammal and one small bird. Species with the highest trapping rate were red and fallow deer, wild boar, silver pheasant (all four species are non-native) and chucao (a native bird). These results suggest that native species are being displaced by non-natives and are currently in very low numbers...|$|R
