25|$|Ten-pin bowling was {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 1960. This was driven by the opening of the Stamford Hill and Golders Green bowling <b>alleys</b> in London. Ten-pin bowling took the UK by storm, with <b>alleys</b> opening up one after the other. At its peak, there were over 160 bowling <b>alleys</b> in the UK, but a lack of re-investment and waning interest left the fad in a sorry state. This led to a general deterioration of bowling <b>alleys,</b> with a commensurate decline in their image. In the 1970s a major chain operator, Top Rank, pulled out of bowling and converted many of the more luxurious <b>alleys</b> into Bingo halls. The industry nearly collapsed, with two thirds of the existing <b>alleys</b> closing over the next few years.|$|R

He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. <b>Alley</b> suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. <b>Alley</b> eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to <b>Alley</b> two days later.

The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. <b>Alley</b> lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, <b>Alley</b> was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
