5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank</b> for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
500|$|Flexible-fuel {{technology}} started {{being developed}} by Brazilian engineers {{near the end of}} the 1990s. The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier neat ethanol vehicles, was kept to avoid start up problems in the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below [...] An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 and allowed to eliminate the need for this secondary gas reservoir tank. Another improvement was the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008.

500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank</b> was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front idler wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E

2500|$|Brazilian {{flex fuel}} {{vehicles}} can operate with ethanol mixtures up to E100, which is hydrous ethanol (with up to 4% water), which causes vapor pressure to drop faster {{as compared to}} E85 vehicles. As a result, Brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine. During a cold start pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures. This provision is particularly necessary for users of Brazil's southern and central regions, where temperatures normally drop below [...] during the winter. An improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gas storage tank. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first Brazilian flex fuel model without an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank</b> for cold start.|$|E

50|$|For {{some time}} it {{remained}} practice {{to place the}} main ballast tanks outside the pressure hull, but to keep the smaller <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tanks</b> inside the hull and below the deck. In the US Navy T-class submarines, this tank wall was at least curved to resist pressure.|$|R

2500|$|E100 {{imposes a}} {{limitation}} on normal vehicle operation, as ethanol's lower evaporative pressure (as compared to gasoline) causes problems when cold {{starting the engine}} at temperatures below [...] For this reason, both pure ethanol and E100 flex-fuel vehicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold by initially injecting gasoline. [...] Once started, the engine is then switched back to ethanol. An improved flex-fuel engine generation was developed to {{eliminate the need for}} the secondary gas tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing them to start at temperatures as low as , the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. The Polo E-Flex, launched in March 2009, was the first flex-fuel model without an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank</b> for cold start. The warming system, called Flex Start, was developed by Robert Bosch GmbH.|$|E
2500|$|The 56th Fighter Group won a Distinguished Unit Citation for {{a series}} of {{missions}} flown between 20 February and 9 March 1944. The campaign opened with Operation Argument, better known as [...] "the Big Week", a sustained attempt to destroy the Luftwaffe in the air while attacking aircraft factories with strategic bombing. It was also the first use by P-47s of 150-gallon drop tanks, which boosted flight endurance time on the Thunderbolt from 1 hour 50 minutes on internal fuel to over three hours using an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank.</b> At the same time the 56th was assigned a bomber escort sector in the vicinity of Osnabrück, and the combination resulted in the shooting down of 49 Luftwaffe fighters over four days. The last week of the campaign saw the first USAAF bomber attacks on Berlin, and the group destroyed 38 more fighters in the air. The 56th Fighter Group recorded its 350th kill on 16 March, having shot down 140 German aircraft in 12 missions.|$|E
2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank</b> (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance.|$|E
2500|$|... 1967 {{also saw}} a {{remarkable}} result by Rhodesian driver John Love with a 2.7-litre four-cylinder Cooper-Climax. Love, who was in his forties and although seen {{as one of the}} finest drivers in Southern Africa was not a major star, led and finished second in that year's South African Grand Prix. Love's obsolete Cooper was originally designed for the short races of the Tasman Series; to run a full Grand Prix, Love added two <b>auxiliary</b> fuel <b>tanks.</b> Unfortunately the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tank's</b> fuel pump failed and forced him to refuel after having led most of the race.|$|R
50|$|Operation Judgment {{was just}} {{a small part of}} the {{overarching}} Operation MB8. It was originally scheduled to take place on 21 October 1940, Trafalgar Day, but a fire in an <b>auxiliary</b> fuel <b>tank</b> of one Swordfish led to a delay. (The 60 imp gal <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tanks</b> replaced the usual third crewman to extend the operating range of the aircraft enough to reach Taranto.) This minor fire spread into something more serious that destroyed two Swordfish. Eagle then suffered a breakdown in her fuel system, so she was eliminated.|$|R
