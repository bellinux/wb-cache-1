5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the urging}} of his crewmen, Choe changed his clothes in a ritual fashion in {{preparation}} for death, although he prayed to the heavens to spare him and his crew, <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> sins they had committed to deserve this fate. On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the Yellow Sea where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) are {{suspicious}} that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) new boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) is using her. Pete and Liz follow Paul {{to a bar}} and find out {{that he is a}} Jenna Maroney impersonator, performing as her in a drag show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows what Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E

5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
25|$|Number Crunch – A {{question}} <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> {{percentage of}} the Nation answered a question a certain way is shown, along with a three digit number representing two possible percentages; for example, “454” would represent both 45% and 54%. The hosts each pick the percentage {{they believe to be}} correct.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian method {{does not}} reduce the 7 to 6. Rather it {{increases}} the subtrahend hundred's digit by one. A small mark is made near or below this digit (depending on the school). Then the subtraction proceeds by <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> number when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7. The answer is 1, and is written down in the result's hundred's place.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} her stage name was chosen, Aoi explained: [...] "My agency <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> color I liked. I said blue [...] He also <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> I like in general. I said sky [...] So, she chose Aoi Sora." ...|$|R

25|$|Relatively little {{merchandise}} for Yggdra Union {{has been}} released, {{in contrast to}} the large quantities for Riviera. This is despite the fact that Sting has posted a survey <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> types of merchandise fans would like, as well as the varied results collected. The Perfect Audio Collection Plus was in the works before the survey was ever released, however, because Sting was certain that an official soundtrack would be a popular request.|$|E
25|$|Richmond's {{campaign}} team {{erupts in}} cheers when they learn Richmond and Adams are now {{close in the}} poll numbers. He receives a phone call, <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> the caller wants as he watches Gwen and Jamie talk. Richmond's driver drops him off {{at the house of}} Jamie's grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard). Jamie later arrives and asks his grandfather what was so important that he needed to talk to him, then he sees Richmond, who asks Jamie why he lied to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Mr. Funk, {{a friend}} of her late husband, appears at her door and pressures Hilde to join the Retiree's Union. She joins because Anton {{had been a member}} of the Austrian Socialist Party and he would have approved of her socializing with other members. Hilde assures Mr. Funk that she will attend the next evening social. Mr. Funk's visit forces another memory to resurface. She remembers her daughter <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> party Anton had belonged to during the period of National Socialism; Hilde recalled him being part of the Hitler Youth. The reader also discovers that Hilde's brother, Hannes, was killed by the Nazi Party. Erika's insolence upsets Hilde greatly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{title of}} the book, Do Not <b>Ask</b> <b>What</b> Good We Do, is taken from a {{sentence}} in a letter from Fisher Ames to Thomas Dwight, dated May 30, 1796: [...] "Do not <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> good we do : {{that is not a}} fair question, in these days of faction." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "When it is <b>asked,</b> <b>What</b> is {{the nature}} of all our reasonings {{concerning}} matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is <b>asked,</b> <b>What</b> is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and <b>ask,</b> <b>What</b> is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication."

25|$|The Capital District, {{having a}} history of {{settlement}} stretching back 400 years, has had many different architectural styles built over the years. Early Dutch farmhouses are still standing in the rural towns, especially west of Albany, such as the Mabee House. The Van Ostrande-Radliff House (1728) in Albany and the Rosa House in Schenectady (before 1700) are the oldest houses in each city. In 1885 American Architect and Building News, a magazine with national circulation, polled its readers <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> the nation's Top Ten most beautiful buildings were. Two buildings {{in the city of}} Albany made the list: Albany City Hall and the New York State Capitol; both finished in 1883 and designed by Henry Hobson Richardson.|$|E
25|$|Events of seismic {{proportions}} {{were then}} {{taking place in}} China proper. On October 10 there was an uprising in Wuchang and a revolution against the minority ruling class had begun. One province after another declared its independence from the Qing authority. Believing that his position was untenable, Sando wired the Beijing government asking for permission to resign, but his request was denied. In the meantime, the Mongolian delegation to Russia secretly returned, and reported the results of its trip {{to a group of}} princes and lamas. They composed a joint memorial to the Khutukhtu <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> Mongolia should do in lieu of the provincial uprisings. He advised that Mongolians form a state of their own.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the night, the WCW wrestlers {{came into}} the ring, {{accompanied}} by Shane McMahon. The WWF wrestlers then came into the ring and, before ECW entered, the WCW and WWF wrestlers started to brawl. The WWF wrestlers cleared the ring, but then were stormed by the ECW wrestlers and taken out. The WCW wrestlers came into the ring, high-fived the ECW men and then dismantled the WWF wrestlers as Paul Heyman and Shane McMahon hugged in triumph. Upon seeing a stunned Vince McMahon <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> was going on, Shane admitted being responsible for all the events that just transpired and announced that ECW and WCW merged to form The Alliance – with Stephanie McMahon as ECW's new owner.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, {{beginning}} a {{reform of the}} institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged students to think about military history by <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> {{they would have done}} in the place of the commanders. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, but this is not corroborated by Wilson’s diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.|$|E
25|$|In 1809 Carl Friedrich Gauss {{published}} his method of calculating {{the orbits of}} celestial bodies. In that work {{he claimed to have}} been in possession of the method of least squares since 1795. This naturally led to a priority dispute with Legendre. However, to Gauss's credit, he went beyond Legendre and succeeded in connecting the method of least squares with the principles of probability and to the normal distribution. He had managed to complete Laplace's program of specifying a mathematical form of the probability density for the observations, depending on a finite number of unknown parameters, and define a method of estimation that minimizes the error of estimation. Gauss showed that arithmetic mean is indeed the best estimate of the location parameter by changing both the probability density and the method of estimation. He then turned the problem around by <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> form the density should have and what method of estimation should be used to get the arithmetic mean as estimate of the location parameter. In this attempt, he invented the normal distribution.|$|E
500|$|In May, H. P. Caemmerer, {{secretary}} of the Commission of Fine Arts, a body charged with making recommendations on the approval of coinage design, wrote to the Sesquicentennial Commission, <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> they proposed {{to do about the}} coins. [...] Having received no reply, he wrote again in late August, this time to Milton Medary, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> progress had been made. [...] Medary replied that the Sesquicentennial Commission was in touch with the new Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint, John R. Sinnock (his predecessor, George T. Morgan, had died in January), but that Sinnock had not yet submitted satisfactory designs.|$|E

500|$|NBC-TV's [...] "Saturday Night Live" [...] {{did some}} comedy {{sketches}} of Idi Amin portrayed by comedian Garrett Morris in the 1970s.

Everyone called <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> happened to their relative that got arrested or taken away and Idi Amin always replied, [...] "Simple, they were killed in an auto accident." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in 1995, BBC Radio 3 sent Stockhausen {{a package}} of {{recordings}} from contemporary artists Aphex Twin, Richie Hawtin (Plastikman), Scanner and Daniel Pemberton, and asked him for his opinion on the music. In August of that year, Radio 3 reporter Dick Witts interviewed Stockhausen about these pieces for a broadcast in October, subsequently published in the November issue of the British publication The Wire <b>asking</b> <b>what</b> advice he would give these young musicians.
