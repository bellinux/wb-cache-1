5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written {{within a few}} years of each other, and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E
5|$|GCC's {{advocacy}} activities included lobbying government officials, grassroots lobbying through {{press releases}} and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, {{criticism of the}} processes of international climate organizations, critiques of climate models, and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of anthropogenic climate change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, NATO officially {{recognized}} three aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia. Macedonia {{has been}} prevented from joining the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political debate {{on the topic of}} membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some of his more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities <b>and</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>to</b> Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{visit was}} a highmark in {{relations}} between Australia and South Vietnam. Over time, Diệm became unpopular with his foreign allies, {{who began to}} criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By {{the time of his}} assassination, he had little support. Australia later sent troops to support South Vietnam in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the Vietnam War grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South Vietnam after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National coalition to power in 1975, Vietnamese refugees were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the Civil Rights Movement <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, the {{governor}} of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the blasphemy law. (Mumtaz Qadri {{was sentenced to death}} for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E

5|$|The government's {{campaign}} was criticized as having poor promotional videos, especially lacking in informational value. The {{final days of}} the campaign were marked by events in support of <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> joining the EU, as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb, while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 (some arrests occurred). The Croatian Bishops' Conference called on citizens to vote in the referendum, reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention; they said that the event represents a great opportunity for Croatia. In contrast to EU accession opponents' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Markač were released by the ICTY, Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia to vote in the referendum and said that he would vote in favour of joining the EU.|$|E
5|$|The party {{claims that}} by disowning tariffs and {{restrictions}} {{imposed by the}} European Union Customs Union (EUCU) the UK can focus on adopting amicable free trade with the Commonwealth of Nations. The party would further seek to reduce unemployment by limiting the proportion of migrant work imported from EU member states, as well as attempt to lower Council Tax by scrapping the fiscal implications of the union's Landfill Directive. Independence from Europe claims that by abandoning the EU, and thus the cost of membership, the UK's national debt can be cleared. Domestic budgetary policies include the raising of personal allowance to £15,000, broad simplification of both personal and corporate tax <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> zero-hours contracts. In addition, the party condones the forced collection of tax from evaders and the nationalisation of private finance initiatives (PFIs).|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists and the new regency {{government}} considered retreating to Ireland. Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress. Despite Louis controlling Westminster Abbey, {{he could not be}} crowned king because the English Church and the Papacy backed Henry. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. In a bid to take advantage of this, Henry encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the Magna Carta, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy. The move was not successful <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Henry's new government hardened.|$|E

5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation <b>and</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
