5|$|Wage growth {{beginning}} in 1950 pushed prices up. The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell. High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy, <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> public expenditures, {{and increases in}} taxes and utility prices. Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed {{became one of the}} leading causes for Perón's downfall in the Revolución Libertadora of 1955, as the working classes saw their quality of life diminished, thus stripping Perón from a large part of his popular support.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions that range from securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults. Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a Nod media manipulation, which convinces {{the world that the}} GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of Nod in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1999, Abdullah II {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah {{embarked}} on aggressive economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring, including <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighbouring countries.|$|E

5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins as}} two one-way streets, Goodell Street (traveling west) and East Tupper Street (traveling east). Both {{intersect}} with NY5 (Ellicott Street) in Buffalo, {{from where they}} serve as a one-way couplet for three blocks before they merge to become the Kensington Expressway, a limited-access highway. It initially travels through dense urban areas by way of <b>a</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>in</b> which both roadways are separated only by a Jersey barrier. The expressway runs past the Buffalo Museum of Science, located at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, and {{through the middle of}} Humboldt Parkway in Buffalo, where the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198) leaves at the former exit for Main Street. The section of the expressway between the Scajaquada and Harlem Road (NY240) just outside the city limit is the busiest on all of NY33, handling in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day in areas.|$|E

5|$|US40Scenic was {{assigned}} to old US40 from Fifteen Mile Creek Road over Town Hill to the Mann Road intersection when US40 was moved to its and I-68's present alignment over Town Hill in 1965. US40 was expanded to a divided highway {{and moved to a}} new alignment from High Germany Road to the sweeping curve that is now Exit74 in 1983. The section of old US40 from the 19491952 Sideling Hill relocation immediately around Sideling Hill Creek was dismantled. The upgraded US40 became a part of I-68 that passes through <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Sideling Hill around 1987. The old alignment over Sideling Hill was transferred to county maintenance and designated US40Scenic around 1989.

5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
5|$|The four-lane iconic skyway {{carries the}} US1/9 {{concurrency}} for most its length. While the skyway generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, US1 and US9 are generally north–south routes. The {{west end of}} the skyway begins as US1/9 roadway ascends and passes over Raymond Boulevard in Newark's Ironbound neighborhood. At Tonnele Circle, US1/9 exits to grade and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge and the skyway becomes the four-lane Route139 as it passes over it. While the road continues to the Holland Tunnel, the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Bergen Hill, just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic, the skyway also passes over the New Jersey Turnpike, with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on landfilled wetlands of the New Jersey Meadowlands.|$|E
