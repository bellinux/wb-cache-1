Parks later said about being asked to move {{to the rear of the}} bus, [...] "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back." [...] Blake said, [...] "Why don't you stand up?" [...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... 8 Miles High {{had made}} a {{significant}} impact on the Australian alternative charts, Pulse, Two-Faced, Karma <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> Way were receiving significant airplay. This led to a main support slot with Grinspoon on their Australian tour in February. This tour effective broke the band on a national level. As a result of the success of the tour and 8 Miles High, the band was approached by Gregg Donovan of Step2 artist management (Grinspoon, Airbourne) who offered them a management contract. [...] "Pulse" [...] was shelved in favour of a remixed, rereleased version of 2 faced. The band shot a film clip for the new version of the tune which was filmed in Melbourne and the song was re-released to radio as a promo single by Shock records. The CD sleeve featured a new band logo more in the style of US nu-metal band Limp Bizkit. This was done without the band's permission and was promptly removed from circulation after complaints from the band. Superheist’s relationship with Shock Records was often tested with the label making numerous ill-fated decisions without consulting the band.|$|E
