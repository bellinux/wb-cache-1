5|$|The City {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics, and proved less successful than The Hills. Like its predecessor, {{the series was}} often criticized for tending towards a narrative format more commonly seen in scripted genres including soap operas, and <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> fabricate much of its storyline. The show has distributed all seasons to DVD.|$|E

5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon.

5|$|Li Long's {{fighting}} {{style in}} Soul Edge {{has been described}} as accessible to novices of the game, while also usable by experienced players. His Reverse Scales attack consists of three swift horizontal attacks one after another, while his Flaming Fangs attack is similar, only vertical, requiring opponents to guard the attacks differently. Other attacks also consist of variations of existing moves with a different conclusion, such as his Combined Wind and Sand-Dust attacks, which both give similar visible cues but with the latter ending in a lower strike. Others moves such as Violent Cannon make use of feints, <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> attack from one angle but striking from another.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E

5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> gaze at the stars. The {{position}} of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy is considerable. She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} in {{development}} for {{one and a}} half years, and involved the work of several divisions, being Kenji Sawaguchi and Tetsuji Yamamoto the total director and producer respectively.

5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam.

As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him stripped to a G-string instead.|$|E
5|$|The series {{travels to}} various churches and congregations {{to have a}} single, unsuspecting member of the church {{presented}} with potential suitors.

A single member of the congregation is introduced {{to his or her}} surprise, while members of the congregation then nominate other single members of the congregation as suitors. The number of suitors is immediately narrowed down to four; they are the top three as voted by the congregation and a fourth chosen by the pastor or minister.|$|E

5|$|A {{story from}} the Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana and the Brihaddharma Purana (13th century) narrates the {{creation}} of all Mahavidyas, including Chhinnamasta. The story is as follows: Sati, the daughter of Daksha, is the first wife of the god Shiva. When she and Shiva are not invited to the fire sacrifice organized by her father, she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, Chhinnamasta stands {{to the right of}} Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the Brihaddharma Purana describes her as <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> the rear of Shiva in the west.|$|E
