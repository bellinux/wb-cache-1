40|$|Children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> {{people who}} {{experience}} domestic violence are often represented as passive witnesses, too vulnerable {{to tell the}} stories of their own lives. This article reports on findings from a 2 year European research project (Understanding Agency and Resistance Strategies, UNARS) with children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in Greece, Italy, Spain and the UK, who had experienced domestic violence. It explores children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people’s understandings of their own capacity to reflect on and disclose their experiences Extracts from individual interviews with 107 children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people (age 8 – 18) were analysed. Three themes are presented, that illustrate children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people’s strategies for managing disclosure: (1) “Being silenced or choosing silence?”, explores children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people’s practices of self-silencing; (2) “Managing disclosures: Finding ways to tell” outlines how children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people value self-expression, and the strategies they use to disclose safely; and in (3) “Speaking with many voices” considers how children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people’s accounts of their experiences are constituted relationally, and are often polyvocal. The article concludes that children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people can be articulate, strategic and reflexive communicators, and that good support for families struggling with domestic violence must enable space for children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people’s voice to be heard. This is possible only in an integrated framework able to encompass multiple layers and perspectives, rather than privileging the adult point of view. Practitioners who work with families affected by domestic violence {{need to recognize that}} children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people are able to reflect on and speak about their experiences.

The Transforming Youth Custody report found 50 per cent of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people aged 15 - 17 years-old were entering custody with literacy levels the equivalent of children aged 7 - 11 years-old. From the children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people entering custody, 18 per cent had statements of special educational needs and 36 per cent of young men ceased attending school at 14 years-old. Figures from the Transforming Youth Custody report, support research conducted by Bryan (2004) that children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people aged between 18 and 21 years-old in YOI has a high proportion of language difficulties. Such concerns highlight the importance of exploring the educational background of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people entering custody and the importance of addressing educational issues before children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people enter custody. By completed a retrospective case file analysis on a representative cohort of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in custody, the researcher will explore the educational background of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people entering custody in the United Kingdom.

40|$|The goal of {{this first}} National Strategy on Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> People’s Participation in Decision-making {{is to ensure that}} {{children}} <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people will have a voice in their individual and collective everyday lives across the five national outcome areas. The strategy is primarily aimed at children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people under the age of 18, but also embraces the voice of young people in the transition to adulthood up to the age of 24. The strategy is guided and influenced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The strategy focuses on the everyday lives of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people <b>and</b> the places and spaces in which they are entitled to have a voice in decisions that affect their lives. Accordingly, the strategy identifies the following objectives and priority areas for action: 1. Children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people will have a voice in decisions made in their local communities. 2. Children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people will have a voice in decision-making in early education, schools and the wider formal and non-formal education systems. 3. Children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people will have a voice in decisions that affect their health and well-being, including on the health and social services delivered to them. 4. Children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people will have a voice in the Courts and legal system. The strategy contains a series of additional objectives, which include: 5. Promoting effective leadership to champion and promote participation of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people. 6. Development of education and training for professionals working with and on behalf of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people. 7. Mainstreaming the participation of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in the development of policy, legislation and research. Underlying all objectives in this strategy are the following key fundamentals: • recognition that children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> {{people have a right to}} participate in decisions that affect their lives; • ensuring the protection and welfare of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in accordance with Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 4; • improving and establishing mechanisms to ensure the participation of seldom-heard and vulnerable children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in decision-making; • collection of data, monitoring and evaluation of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people’s participation initiatives...|$|R

40|$|More than 4, 000 {{children}} <b>and</b> <b>young</b> {{people take}} part in consultations to tell the NSW Government what {{is or is not}} working for them. Introduction Every process has a beginning and this report sets out, in detail, the beginning of the development of the first whole of government Strategic Plan for Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> People in NSW. Under the Advocate for Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> People Act 2014, the Advocate is mandated to prepare, in consultation with Minister John Ajaka MLC, a three-year whole of government Strategic Plan for Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> People. Promoting the participation of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in decision making is central {{to the role of the}} office of the Advocate for Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> People <b>and</b> as such it was essential to ensure not only that the voices of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people inform the first Strategic Plan but that children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people had the first say on setting the themes and directions of the Plan. Our commitment to ensuring that the voices of children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people feature in the Strategic Plan led us to consult with more than 4, 000 children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in NSW. In this report you will discover the results of our consultations along with the methods employed to engage such a vast number in the consultation process and the learnings we take from the process. Consulting with more than 4, 000 children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in a meaningful way is certainly no easy feat and we are indebted to the many government and non-government organisations who came forward with their support and assistance in engaging children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people through their networks and of course a special thanks to the children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people who took part in the consultations. All participants in the consultation process contributed their time voluntarily; the willingness and enthusiasm displayed by children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people not only in committing their time to engage in the consultations but also the meaningful contributions they made are an overwhelming reminder of the value of participation. The first whole of government Strategic Plan for Children <b>and</b> <b>Young</b> People in NSW is significant progress in the NSW Government’s commitment to making the lives of our youngest citizens better. Through positive collaboration across government departments the Plan aims to bring about positive and tangible change for children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people. Throughout the pages of this report you will gain insight into how children <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people in NSW view what is already being done to assist them in every day life and you will also find out what they feel the NSW Government can do or change to further enhance their experience of growing up in NSW...|$|R
