Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
