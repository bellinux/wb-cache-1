40|$|The {{influence}} of different <b>activator</b> <b>impurities</b> on the scintillation yield of alkali halides {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} temperature. Luminescence spectra of pure and activated CsI and NaI scintillation crystals were measured under X-ray and VUV excitation at temperatures from 10 to 300 [*]K. In indium- and thallium-doped crystals activator centers can capture electrons. Along with self-trapping of holes at low temperatures, electron capture by the dopant results in energy storage. This leads to a significant decrease of luminescence yield. In Eu-doped NaI and CsI crystals activator centers capture a hole first. In this way, at low temperatures electrons recombine either with self-trapped holes (yielding STE emission), or with holes trapped by the activator (giving rise to Eu emission band). No energy loss at low temperature is evident in CsI:Eu and NaI:Eu crystals...|$|R
50|$|The {{scintillation}} {{process in}} inorganic materials {{is due to}} the electronic band structure found in crystals and is not molecular in nature {{as is the case with}} organic scintillators. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an energy gap; see picture). This leaves an associated hole behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the forbidden gap. The excitons are loosely bound electron-hole pairs which wander through the crystal lattice until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. The latter then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component). The <b>activator</b> <b>impurities</b> are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or near-UV where photomultipliers are effective. The holes associated with electrons in the conduction band are independent from the latter. Those holes and electrons are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain metastable states not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states again results in scintillation light (slow component).|$|R
