5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge <b>against</b> <b>those</b> who had wronged them.|$|E

Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names.

5|$|For Sihanouk, {{this proved}} to be a {{marriage}} of convenience that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge <b>against</b> <b>those</b> who had betrayed him. For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause. The personal appeal of Sihanouk, and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized Khmer Republic.|$|E

5|$|For many centuries, {{the people}} within the Nri hegemony were {{committed}} to peace. This religious pacifism was rooted in a belief that violence was an abomination which polluted the earth.

5|$|In 1990, {{after being}} sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, {{a former member}} turned critic, offered {{a large amount of}} the group's highly {{confidential}} teachings in court.

5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda.

Gregory's early policies as bishop often went <b>against</b> <b>those</b> of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the Sabellianist followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics, Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church.|$|E
