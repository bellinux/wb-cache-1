It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> her.

[...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E

I thought he was a great {{defensive}} player and, at that time, the reputation was there were certain people who would take cheap shots at other players. Philip never did that. He really played straight up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really <b>respected</b> him for that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>respected</b> his game." ...|$|R

500|$|Wenger's {{relations}} {{with his fellow}} football managers and officials {{have not always been}} genial. In a joint-interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, he explained that his reluctance to trust other managers had been mistaken for discourtesy: [...] "There are managers I respect, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> what they do, but you cannot be completely friendly and open up". He is well known for his rivalry with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson; beginning in 1997, the dispute reached its culmination in the [...] "Pizzagate" [...] incident at Old Trafford in October 2004. After Manchester United ended Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten Premier League run after being awarded a dubious penalty, a member of the Arsenal squad allegedly threw a pizza at the opposition in the tunnel. Wenger accused United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of being [...] "a cheat" [...] in a post-match television interview, and was reprimanded with a £15,000 fine by the Football Association. Both managers later agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In his autobiography, Ferguson wrote that the events of [...] "Pizzagate" [...] had [...] "scrambled Arsène's brain" [...] and caused their relationship to break down for almost five years. By 2009, Wenger noted his rivalry with Ferguson had become [...] "respectful" [...] as Arsenal had ceased competing with Manchester United for major honours.|$|E
500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans were singing Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> the fans have individuals they like. But we have a healthy squad here and I picked what I felt was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E

"Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{coalition}} was formed mid-December 2008 between Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc (OU-OSD), Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) and Lytvyn Bloc (LB) Yushchenko told journalists: [...] "The [...] {{fact is that}} the so-called coalition was formed on basis of political corruption, this coalition will be able to work only if the Communist Party will join it. Speaking about such a type of coalition, it is even more shameful." [...] Victor Yushchenko also stated that Yulia Tymoshenko’s desire to keep the Prime Minister's job was the main motive for creating the coalition and that he wanted to expel the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc lawmakers who supported the creating of the OU-PSD, BYuT and LB coalition from the list of members of parliament.

[...] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and the best friend of Peyton, and close friend of Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents, her friends' inability to take her seriously, and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leaving her hurt.

2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{release of the}} game, some players were {{disappointed}} that they lost the option of using Quiet as an ally after completing [...] "Mission 45: A Quiet Exit". David Roberts of GamesRadar wrote few developers {{would be willing to}} incur the wrath of players by creating {{one of the most powerful}} characters in the game, [...] "integrating her completely so as to make her absolutely vital during some particularly difficult missions, then taking her away forever.

[...] However, the November 2015 release of the Version 1.06 update adds the ability to bring Quiet back in the game.
