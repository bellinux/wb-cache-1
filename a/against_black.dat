5|$|The exact {{death toll}} during the New York Draft Riots is unknown, but {{according}} to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days. The riots forced hundreds of black people to flee the city.

In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.|$|E
5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly <b>against</b> <b>black</b> suffrage.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According to The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination <b>against</b> <b>black</b> performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E

5|$|The Match of 10,000 Tacks was up next, pitting Abyss and Raven <b>against</b> <b>Black</b> Reign and Rellik. Rhino was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a part of the match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik into a pile of thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches as a result of this match.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted <b>against</b> <b>Black.</b> Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence <b>against</b> <b>black</b> Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E

From the beginning, whites employed all levers of national power including laws to suppress black resistance. The laws became counterinsurgency weapons launched <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> in an internal conflict lasting generations...|$|R

5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence <b>against</b> <b>black</b> residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E
5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used <b>against</b> <b>black</b> women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E
