Sixth to eighth grade youth from two low-income communities {{in each of the three}} states of South Dakota, Kansas and Ohio were involved in the study. Fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was measured using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> screener tool.

40|$|Efforts to {{increase}} fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consump­tion {{are a significant}} aspect of national approaches to preventive health. However, policy frameworks for increasing fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption rarely take an integrated food-systems approach that includes a focus on production. In this policy analysis and commentary we examine fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> production in peri-urban areas of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, and highlight the significance of emerging environmental and eco­nomic pressures on fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> production. This examination will {{be of interest to}} other locations around the world also experiencing pressure on their peri-urban agriculture. These pressures suggest that the availability and afforda­bility of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> supplies cannot be taken for granted, and that future initiatives {{to increase}} fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption should include a focus on sustainable production. Threats to production that include environmental pressures, together with the loss and cost of peri-urban agri­cultural land and a cost-price squeeze due to rising input costs and low farm-gate prices, act in combi­nation to threaten the viability of the Victorian fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> industries. We pro­pose that policy initiatives to increase fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption should include measures to address the pressures facing production, and that the most effective policy responses are likely to be integrated approaches that aim to increase fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> availability <b>and</b> affordability through innovative solutions to problems of production and distribu­tion.

40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Human Nutrition)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2007. INTRODUCTION: Epidemiologic {{research}} strongly {{supports the}} importance of adequate fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake {{for the promotion of}} human health and the prevention of chronic disease. Data suggest that fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption in children may protect against an array of childhood illnesses. Low fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake has been recognized as a key contributor to micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries. Evidence indicates that fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption is inadequate in both developed and developing nations. A paucity of data on fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption exists in South Africa. Quantification of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption is important for the worldwide drive to increase consumption and for strategy development to address inadequate consumption. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the dietary intake data (24 hour recall questionnaire (24 -H-RQ) and quantified food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ)), collected during the 1999 National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) in 12 – 108 month old children in South Africa, was conducted to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Self-efficacy {{and social}} support are {{considered}} relevant predictors of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. This study examines whether the effect of self-efficacy on fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake is mediated by intention and whether this motivational process is moderated by received dietary social support. Methods: A longitudinal study with two measurement points in time, four weeks apart, on fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was carried out with 473 students aged 19 years on average (52 % women). In a conditional process analysis, dietary intention was specified as a mediator between self-efficacy <b>and</b> fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake, whereas received dietary support was specified as a moderator of the self-efficacy–intention association, controlling for baseline fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. Results: Self-efficacy was positively associated with fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake four weeks later, and intention mediated this process. Moreover, an interaction between received dietary support and self-efficacy on intention emerged. Conclusions: The effect of self-efficacy on fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was fully mediated by intention. Moreover, received support exhibited a moderating role within the motivational process: high dietary support appeared to accentuate the positive relationship between self-efficacy and dietary intention...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in {{children}} remains below recommendations in many countries. The {{long-term effects of}} early parental feeding practices on fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake are not clearly established. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of the current}} study was to examine whether early feeding practices influence later fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in preschool children. DESIGN: The study used data from 4 European cohorts: the British Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), the French Etude des Déterminants pre et postnatals de la santé et du développement de l'Enfant study, the Portuguese Generation XXI Birth Cohort, and the Greek EuroPrevall study. Fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was assessed in each cohort by food-frequency questionnaire. Associations between early feeding practices, such as breastfeeding and timing of complementary feeding, <b>and</b> fruit and/or <b>vegetable</b> intake in 2 - 4 -y-old children were tested by using logistic regressions, separately in each cohort, after adjustment for infant's age and sex and maternal age, educational level, smoking during pregnancy, and maternal fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. RESULTS: Large differences in early feeding practices were highlighted across the 4 European cohorts with longer breastfeeding duration in the Generation XXI Birth Cohort and earlier introduction to complementary foods in ALSPAC. Longer breastfeeding duration was consistently related to higher fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in young children, whereas the associations with age of introduction to fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake were weaker and less consistent across the cohorts. Mothers' fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake (available in 3 of the cohorts) did not substantially attenuate the relation with breastfeeding duration. CONCLUSION: The concordant positive association between breastfeeding duration <b>and</b> fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in different cultural contexts favors an independent specific effect...|$|R

Only low-carbohydrate fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g.

Participants were randomly assigned to two levels of intervention frequency matched for intervention content (low frequency n = 92, high frequency n = 102). Participants received TPB-based email messages designed to increase fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption, messages targeted attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Baseline and post-intervention measures of TPB variables and behaviour were collected. Across the entire study cohort, fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption increased by 0. 83 servings/day between baseline and follow-up.

The increase of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption is a promising preliminary finding for those primarily interested in increasing fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption. However, those interested in theory development may have concerns about the use of this model to explain behaviour change in this context.
