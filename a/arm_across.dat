5|$|The sixth {{match was}} a singles match between Kane versus Impostor Kane. The match began with Impostor Kane {{executing}} a sidewalk slam on Kane, a move {{in which a}} wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, and reaches around the opponent's torso with his near <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> the opponent's chest and under both arms and places the other arm under the victim's legs. The Impostor tried to grab and lift Kane by the throat and slam him down into the mat, termed as a chokeslam, but Kane countered with driving Impostor Kane's head onto the wrestling mat. The match concluded with Impostor Kane performing a chokeslam on Kane and pinning him for the pinfall victory.|$|E

25|$|Shoulder (Glenohumeral joint) (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or shoulder, joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E

25|$|While most {{throws a}} first baseman must make {{go to the}} right, which a {{left-hander}} can generally accomplish with greater speed and fluency, this is a relatively small factor {{to the advantage of}} a left-handed first baseman. More important advantages are related to the position of a left-handed first baseman with respect to the base. First, a left-handed first baseman has an advantage over his right-handed counterpart when catching a pickoff throw from the pitcher—when a first baseman is in pickoff position, {{standing in front of the}} bag, the left-hander can catch the ball and make a tag without having to move his <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> his body. (See the picture in the Strategy over the course of the game section below for the standard pickoff position with a right-handed first baseman.) Second, because the first baseman starts most plays with his left leg closer to the base, the left-hander does not have to make a half-pivot to get into the correct position to stretch out for a throw. For these reasons, left-handed throwers are far more common at first base than in the general population of baseball players. In contrast, cricket is fielded in the round: the handedness of the fielder in any given position is of far less consequence due to the priority being placed on catching rather than throwing, coupled with the fact that the batsmen are running in opposite directions and both left-handed and right-handed throwers are found in all parts of the field.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} test, all {{personnel}} were evacuated {{from the target}} fleet and Bikini Atoll. They boarded ships of the support fleet, which took safe positions at least [...] east of the atoll. Test personnel were issued special dark glasses to protect their eyes, but {{a decision was made}} shortly before Able that the glasses might not be adequate. Personnel were instructed to turn away from the blast, shut their eyes, and cradle their <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> their face for additional protection. A few observers who disregarded the recommended precautions advised the others when the bomb detonated. Most shipboard observers reported feeling a slight concussion and hearing a disappointing little [...] "poom".|$|E
2500|$|If a batsman scores four when he hits [...] {{the ball}} across the {{boundary}} (not by actually running them), the umpire signals this by waving his arm {{back and forth}} in front of the chest. This signal varies a lot between umpires, from two short, restrained, waves finishing with the <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> the chest, to elaborate signals that resemble those of a conductor of an orchestra.
