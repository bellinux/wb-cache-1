40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of innovation activity {{and its relation}} to traditional academic activity at Chalmers University of Technology is presented. A list of 14 yardsticks of faculty performance is given and compared with the innovation activities. A description of the steadily increasing patent <b>application</b> and <b>spin-off</b> company activity at Chalmers is presented. The undergraduate grades of spin-off company founders are compared with those of non-founders. The average grades in the two groups are very similar, but the spreads in grades of the individual students in the two groups are significantly different. Spin-off company founders tend to have a wider spread in grades than non-founders. A study of science citations vs patent applications for 44 researchers/inventors at Chalmers reveals a strong positive rank correlation between these two activities. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{guide the}} {{development}} of the Ra Strategic Framework, we defined scientific and applications objectives. For our primary areas of scientific interest, we choose the corona, the solar wind, the Sun's effect on the Earth, and solar theory and model development. For secondary areas of scientific interest, we selected sunspots, the solar constant, the Sun's gravitational field, helioseismology and the galactic cosmic rays. We stress the importance of stereoscopic imaging, observations at high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, as well as of long duration measurements. Further exploration of the Sun's polar regions is also important, as shown already by the Ulysses mission. From an applications perspective, we adopted three broad objectives that would derive complementary inputs for the Strategic Framework. These were to identify and investigate: possible <b>application</b> <b>spin-offs</b> from science missions, possible solar-terrestrial missions dedicated to a particular application, and possible future applications that require technology development. The Sun can be viewed as both a source of resources and of threats. Our principal applications focus was that of threat mitigation, by examining ways to improve solar threat monitoring and early warning systems. We compared these objectives to the mission objectives of past, current, and planned international solar missions. Past missions (1962 - 1980) seem to have been focused on improvement of scientific knowledge, using multiple instrument spacecraft. A ten year gap followed this period, during which the results from previous missions were analyzed and solar study programmes were prepared in international organizations. Current missions (1990 - 1996) focus on particular topics such as the corona, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. In planned missions, Sun/Earth interactions and environmental effects of solar activity are becoming more important. The corona is the centre of interest of almost all planned missions. It seems that no international long-term strategy has yet been adopted. For these plans the number of necessary future missions can be reduced and the onboard instrumentation can be optimized by performing a comparative analysis. The study of the corona must be done from different observing locations, orbits closer to the Sun, and by different means. The Cluster mission replacement is in progress; however, if the replacement is not implemented, the ISTP programme will fade after 1998. Furthermore, the physics of the Sun's interior should be emphasized more in the Mid- and Far-Term programmes. Finally, more emphasis should be placed on monitoring space weather and forecasting Sun/Earth interactions...|$|R

However, there are hundreds of languages where not even the phoneme inven-tory is known. In the work reported here, phone recognisers are evaluated on a cross-language task with minimum target knowl-edge. A phonetic distance measure is introduced for the evalua-tion, allowing a distance to be calculated between any utterance of any language. This has a number of <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> such as allophone detection, a phone-based ROVER approach to recognition, and cross-language forced alignment.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{inspired}} and {{motivated by the}} need to provide better platforms for persistent surveillance. In the years since the inception of this work, the need for persistence of surveillance platforms has become even more widely appreciated, both within the defense community and the intelligence community. One of the most demanding technical requirements for such a platform involves the power plant and energy storage system, and this project concentrated almost exclusively on the technology associated with this system for a solar powered, high altitude, unmanned aircraft. An important realization for the feasibility of such solar powered aircraft, made at the outset of this project, was that thermal energy may be stored with higher specific energy density than for any other known practical form of rechargeable energy storage. This approach has proved to be extraordinarily fruitful, and a large number of <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> of this technology were developed {{in the course of this}} project...|$|R

In this study, questionnaires were sent to university spin-offs’ inventors. The results from 82 inventors showed how much 9 types of stakeholders contribute to “Gaining connection between manufacturers” and “sales” for university spin-offs. First, technical experts are rated highly than salespersons as inside people of university spin-offs. The reason {{seems to be that}} inventors communicate with technical experts of university spin-offs and manufacturers which are customers by special technology communication. Next, university coordinators are rated highly than financing persons as outside people of university spin-offs. It is likely that inventors communicate with university coordinators by technology comprehension well and they do not do with financing persons by it.

40|$|Serious {{games are}} {{intended}} to provide an engaging, self reinforcing context to motivate and educate the players. One of the challenges in serious gaming is to provide intuitive interaction techniques. Serious games are meant to facilitate creative and educational processes and so they should optimally exploit the cognitive resources of the participants. Current control interfaces for moving around and manipulating objects do not resemble the way we complete these tasks {{in the real world}} and force users to spend a substantial part of their cognitive resources on tasks that require almost no cognitive resources in the real world. A Brain Machine Interface (BMI) allows communication between a user and a machine without the use of the user's sensory-motor systems. For instance, a BMI that is able to distil movement commands from brain activity may enable a user to move around and manipulate objects hands-free and mindfree. At present, the vast majority of BMI research is focused on medical <b>applications,</b> but a <b>spin-off</b> to <b>applications</b> for healthy users is expected.

40|$|Intelligent or {{autonomous}} {{control of}} an entire spacecraft is a major technology that must be developed to enable NASA to meet its human exploration goals. NASAs current long term human space platform, the International Space Station, is in low earth orbit with almost continuous communication with the ground based mission control. This permits the near real-time control by the ground {{of all of the}} core systems including power. As NASA moves beyond Low Earth Orbit, the issues of communication time-lag and lack of communication bandwidth beyond geosynchronous orbit does not permit this type of operation. This paper presents the work currently ongoing at NASA to develop an architecture for an autonomous power control system as well as the effort to assemble that controller into the framework of the vehicle mission manager and other subsystem controllers to enable autonomous control of the complete spacecraft. Due to the common problems faced in both space power systems and terrestrial power system, the potential for <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> of this technology for use in micro-grids located at the edge or user end of terrestrial power grids for peak power accommodation and reliability are described...|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of targeted rehabilitation with biofeedback on balance disorders and subjective visual vertical compensation. During the period of one year, a group of 20 vestibular schwannoma patients were examined and treated in University Hospital Motol. The compensation of vestbuloocular refex was assessed by a tilt of subjective visual vertical. The level of vestibulospinal compensation was determined according to score of the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale.

40|$|A coating {{treatment}} with a silica thin film synthesized by sol-gel process was performed during {{the restoration of}} the Gio Ponti’s Church of Santa Maria Annunciata in Milan (Italy). Despite its recent construction (1964 - 67) the external façades made of porcelain stoneware tiles presented degradation phenomena caused either by exposure to weathering and by the fabrication characteristics of the material. A careful analysis of the deterioration of ceramic elements by optical microscopy and ESEM-EDS was performed in order to characterize the material and to project a proper intervention. A silica thin protective film was synthesized by sol-gel process, according to the method developed by the research group of Chemistry for Cultural Heritage of the University of Padua, and adapted to the specific <b>application</b> by the <b>spin-off</b> company Siltea srl. The method involves the neutral pH catalysis of the sol and the room temperature condensation of the film. The coating was applied by means of conventional air-spray gun. Optical microscopy and ESEM-EDS analysis before and after accelerated ageing on several samples were performed to evaluate the protective efficiency of the coating. The treatment was realized on a surface of 300 square meters with good results, encouraging the application of this new technology as an efficient alternative to the traditional methods, often based on the use of synthetic organicpolymers...|$|R
40|$|The Swarm {{mission of}} the European Space Agency was {{launched}} in November 2013 {{with the objective of}} performing measurements of the earth’s magnetic field with unprecedented accuracy. At the beginning of data collection, two satellites started to fly in orbits with a separation in ascending nodes of 1 �– 1. 5 � at an altitude of about 480 km, and a third satellite has been placed in a higher orbit with an altitude of 530 km. The three spacecraft are equipped with dual-frequency eight-channel GPS receivers for the generation of precise orbits. Although such orbits support the fulfillment of the primary objectives of the mission, precise space baselines may be helpful for studying the earth’s gravity field, a <b>spin-off</b> <b>application</b> of the Swarm mission. Hitherto, a particular challenge for the computation of precise baselines from Swarm has been the presence of half-cycle ambiguities in GPS carrier phase observations, which complicate the implementation of integer ambiguity resolution methods. The present study shows the feasibility of generating carrier phase observations with full-cycle ambiguities, which in turn has been used to improve the performance of reduced-dynamic and kinematic precise baseline determination schemes. The implemented strategies have been tested in a period of 90 days in 2016. The obtained reduced-dynamic and kinematic baseline products were evaluated by inter-product and inter-agency comparisons using two independent software tools...|$|R
40|$|The Rum Jungle uranium-copper mine in {{tropical}} northern Australia {{has been a}} source of acid rock drainage contaminants since the 1950 s which have had adverse impacts on the receiving waters of the Finniss River. Mine site remediation began in 1982 followed by long-term monitoring of water quality and flow based on daily measurements within the Finniss River system. A decade or more after the initiation of these remedial activities a set of investigations have been completed that have measured the post-remedial ecological status of the Finniss River system relative to this environmental benchmark. These studies have also been complemented by studies on various other ecological endpoints. Moreover the Finniss River system has provided unique opportunities for broader scientific goals to be pursued. Because it has been so well-monitored it can be viewed as a natural laboratory to investigate the impacts of acid rock drainage on tropical freshwater biodiversity. The scientific papers presented at this symposium address a broad spectrum of issues that are directly related to environmental sustainability and mining. The topics range across future contaminant scenarios and their predicted ecological impacts the various metrics used to assess ecological detriment to biodiversity the abilities of laminated biological structures to act as archives of pollution history and also <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> in environmental and wildlife management. Furthermore the participation of many stakeholders in open discussion during the symposium provided an important set of views and opinions on the needs for future studies in the Finniss River system...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Academic {{spin-off}} firms are considered an important mechanism to transfer technological knowledge from university to industry, although they often show a low growth rate. One possible cause {{is the lack}} of proper marketing capabilities, since spin-off managers tend to reduce the role of marketing to the implementation of mere tactical activities. This study analyses whether {{spin-off firms}} adopt a market orientation and the effect it produces on firms' economic and innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is based on both quantitative survey data and in-depth interviews, referring to a unique sample including Italian and Spanish spin-off companies. Findings: Results highlight that MKTOR and MARKOR measurement scales show different abilities to capture the implementation of market orientation by sampled firms. We find that the generation and dissemination of information on customers and competitors directly affect firms' ability to develop technological innovations and gain profits. Nevertheless, market orientation also constitutes a challenge to spin-offs, and may eventually generate inefficiencies when external technological conditions require firms to respond quickly to environmental stimuli. Practical implications: The findings of this study are relevant to academic spin-off managers who are responsible for adopting, implementing and maintaining market orientation strategies under different environmental conditions. Limitations: The characteristics of sample used for the quantitative analysis may limit the generalization of results. Originality/value: Even though the market orientation concept has been largely analyzed, no previous study has examined its <b>application</b> by academic <b>spin-offs.</b> By employing qualitative and quantitative analyses we provide novel insights in this respect...|$|R
40|$|Humanity’s {{plans to}} further explore space require the {{development}} of Bio-regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) fully incorporated into the habitats on Moon and Mars. These concepts aim to decrease the (re-) supply mass by (re-) generating essential resources for humans through biological processes. Within a BLSS, the cultivation of higher plants can take an essential role, since it can contribute to all major functional aspects (all-in-one-approach) in closing different loops within a habitat (e. g. food production, CO 2 reduction & O 2 production, water recycling and waste management). Furthermore, fresh crops are not only beneficial for human physiological health, but also {{have a positive impact}} towards the crew’s psychological health. Adding up these features, the higher plants represent a unique asset, which makes the investigation in their cultivation procedures an essential endeavor. The EDEN Initiative is one pillar of the DLR’s ambition to develop BLSS for human long-duration space missions utilizing Higher Plant cultivation. EDEN combines different CEA Technologies (Controlled Environment Agriculture) within a planetary Greenhouse-Module (GHM).

Some have also suggested that the colonization of Mars may be a solution to the global exponential population explosion on our planet! A human mission to and the colonization of the Red Planet requires multi-disciplined expertise in many areas including engineering, technology, science, human health and medicine and the human psychological and behavior.

Such a system would also have myriad direct commercial <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications.</b> The Hybrid Exploration Agent Platform and Sensor Web or HEAP-SW like the ANTS concept is a Sensor Web concept. The HEAP-SW is conceptually and practically a very different system. HEAP-SW is applicable to any environment and a huge range of exploration tasks. It is a very robust, low cost, high return, solution to a complex problem. All of the technology for initial development and implementation is currently available. The HEAP Sensor Web or HEAP-SW consists of three major parts, The Hybrid Exploration Agent Platforms or HEAP, the Sensor Web or SW and the immobile Data collection and Uplink units or DU. The HEAP-SW as a whole will refer to any group of mobile agents or robots where each robot is a mobile data collection unit that spends most of its time acting in concert with all other robots, DUs in the web, and the HEAP-SWs overall Command and Control (CC) system. Each DU and robot is, however, capable of acting independently. The three parts of the HEAP-SW system are discussed in this paper. The Goals of the HEAP-SW system are: 1) To maximize the amount of exploration enhancing science data collected; 2) To minimize data loss due to system malfunctions; 3) To minimize or, possibly, eliminate the risk of total system failure; 4) To minimize the size, weight, and power requirements of each HEAP robot; 5) To minimize HEAP-SW system costs.

40|$|This book {{provides}} {{readers with}} an introductory understanding of Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC), {{a type of}} fusion meant to retain plasma using an electrostatic field. IEC provides a unique approach for plasma confinement, as it offers a number of <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications,</b> such as a small neutron source for Neutron Activity Analysis (NAA), that all work towards creating fusion power. The IEC has been identified in recent times as an ideal fusion power unit because {{of its ability to}} burn aneutronic fuels like p-B 11 {{as a result of its}} non-Maxwellian plasma dominated by beam-like ions. This type of fusion also takes place in a simple mechanical structure small in size, which also contributes to its viability as a source of power. This book posits that the ability to study the physics of IEC in very small volume plasmas makes it possible to rapidly investigate a design to create a power-producing device on a much larger scale. Along with this hypothesis the book also includes a conceptual experiment proposed for demonstrating breakeven conditions for using p-B 11 in a hydrogen plasma simulation.  This book also: Offers an in-depth look, from introductory basics to experimental simulation, of Inertial Electrostatic Confinement, an emerging method for generating fusion power Discusses how the Inertial Electrostatic Confinement method can be applied to other applications besides fusion through theoretical experiments in the text Details the study of the physics of Inertial Electrostatic Confinement in small-volume plasmas and suggests that their rapid reproduction could lead to the creation of a large-scale power-producing device  Perfect for researchers and students working with nuclear fusion, Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) Fusion: Fundamentals and Applications also offers the current experimental status of IEC research, details supporting theories in the field and introduces other potential applications that stem from IEC...|$|R

This paper intends to demonstrate that some strategies which belong to the design discipline {{can be applied to}} the industrial system to produce innovation in terms of new processes, products and materials, crossing different expertises and areas of <b>application</b> to generate <b>spin-off.</b> Currently, more and more research and design teams are composed by people with different nationalities, who often have different cultural backgrounds from each other. The professional collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures are proliferating mainly because the technological contents and the environmental requirements have become so complex that no company can have in itself the skills and resources to innovate. Innovation today is no longer only a enterprise innovation but an innovative result born from a network of relationships and cooperation that comes from the outside and even through the organisation of multidisciplinary working groups, capable of contributing with other points of view, to the growth of a new manufacturing reality. Also, strategic design methodologies can be used to improve the efficacy of the education system reproducing with students the same dynamics and structures that characterized the professional and industrial fields. This approach has the privilege to bring close the students to the real needs and rhythms of working with the everyday reality of professional firms, companies and research centres that very often use this innovative formula involving different kind of people to define in a short time new project scenarios.

40|$|Ever since Peter Shor's {{ground-breaking}} {{discovery in}} 1994 of an algorithm capable of factoring large integers on a quantum-mechanical computer exponentially faster than using any known classical method, research on quantum computing has boomed. Quantum information – a unique mixture of computer science, physics and mathematics – has {{developed into a}} new branch of information theory. On the experimental side, physicists from many different disciplines including atomic, solid-state and low-temperature physics, as well as optics, are striving today towards a practical quantum computer. All the candidate quantum bit (qubit) technologies {{have one thing in}} common: They rely on the controlled time-evolution of a closed quantum system, a seemingly paradoxical task. In this Thesis the temporal control of quantum systems is studied. The topics included can be divided into two according to the type of temporal evolution; geometrical or dynamical. Geometrical realization-independent methods for quantum computing are studied first. Then the study is extended into dynamical quantum computing and the so-called Josephson charge-qubit register is considered as a test bench. Finally, a <b>spin-off</b> <b>application</b> of the geometrical evolution of a Josephson junction system is studied, i. e. Cooper pair pumping. A novel Cooper pair pump, the Cooper pair "sluice", is introduced. The work on quantum computing reported in this Thesis is theoretical while the Cooper pair "sluice" is studied both theoretically and experimentally. Numerical simulations, both sequential and parallel, are used extensively throughout the Thesis. The experiments were carried out under cryogenic mK conditions and the sample fabrication was done using e-beam nanolithography. Because the execution time of a quantum algorithm is always limited by the inevitable process of decoherence, it is important to utilize any measure available for accelerating quantum computations. It is found that practical quantum algorithms could greatly benefit from classical computer-aided optimization. Moreover, it is found that even a modest demonstrator of a full quantum algorithm using Josephson charge qubits is just barely realizable within present-day coherence times. However, the experimental part of this Thesis shows clear evidence of the functioning of the "sluice". While the worldwide effort of improving the coherence properties of qubits is underway, the "sluice" could well find practical use, e. g., in metrology in the foreseeable future. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Noble Metal Reducible Oxide (NMRO) {{catalysts}} for the {{low temperature}} oxidation of carbon monoxide were developed by NASA for the reoxidation of carbon monoxide which forms by the dissociation of carbon dioxide during the operation of sealed carbon dioxide lasers. The NMRO catalyst, which consists of a noble metal {{in conjunction with a}} reducible metal oxide, was evaluated under conditions that will be encountered in a CO 2 laser operation, namely temperatures in the range 298 to 373 K and no significant reaction gas components other than CO, CO 2 and O 2. The NMRO catalysts may have significant potential for <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> such as the prevention of carbon monoxide build-up in closed spaces as in space vehicle cabins or submarines, and the elimination of the cold start-up problem of automobile exhaust catalysts. The most significant difference in the conditions of these possible future applications is the high moisture content of the gases to be processed. Lack of understanding of the effects of water vapor and high temperature on catalyst activity and operation for extended periods are currently the main stumbling blocks for the transfer of this NASA technology to be used for commercial purposes. In the original proposal the following objectives were stated: To obtain experimental data on the adsorption, desorption and reaction characteristics of CO and CO 2 the catalysts under high moisture conditions; to collect evidence on the presence of carbonate and hydroxyl surface species and their involvement in the CO oxidation mechanism; and to model the reaction system using a Monte-Carlo simulation to gain insight on the various steps involved. After the work has commenced the NASA technical monitor Mr. David Scheyer informed us that there was increased interest in the possible use of the NMRO catalysts as automobile exhaust catalysts and therefore NASA wanted to know whether the catalysts can operate at high temperatures as well as with high moisture gases. At that meeting it was decided that investigation of the high temperature performance of the NMRO catalysts should be given priority and replace the Monte-Carlo simulation objective. As a result, the modified objectives of the investigation were taken as the investigation of the high-temperature activity of the NMRO catalysts, and the effect of water vapor on the performance of these catalysts...|$|R
40|$|The ICF Annual Report {{provides}} {{documentation of}} {{the achievements of the}} LLNL ICF Program during the fiscal year by the use of two formats: (1) an Overview that is a narrative summary of important results for the fiscal year and (2) a compilation of the articles that previously appeared in the ICF Quarterly Report that year. Both the Overview and Quarterly Report are also on the Web at [URL] Beginning in Fiscal Year 1997, the fourth quarter issue of the ICF Quarterly was no longer printed as a separate document but rather included in the ICF Annual. This change provided a more efficient process of documenting our accomplishments with-out unnecessary duplication of printing. In addition we introduced a new document, the ICF Program Monthly Highlights. Starting with the September 1997 issue and each month following, the Monthly Highlights will provide a brief description of noteworthy activities of interest to our DOE sponsors and our stakeholders. The underlying theme for LLNL's ICF Program research continues to be defined within DOE's Defense Programs missions and goals. In support of these missions and goals, the ICF Program advances research and technology development in major interrelated areas that include fusion target theory and design, target fabrication, target experiments, and laser and optical science and technology. While in pursuit of its goal of demonstrating thermonuclear fusion ignition and energy gain in the laboratory, the ICF Program provides research and development opportunities in fundamental high-energy-density physics and supports the necessary research base for the possible long-term application of inertial fusion energy for civilian power production. ICF technologies continue to have <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> for additional government and industrial use. In addition to these topics, the ICF Annual Report covers non-ICF funded, but related, laser research and development and associated applications. We also provide a short summary of the quarterly activities within Nova laser operations, Beamlet laser operations, and National Ignition Facility laser design. LLNL's ICF Program falls within DOE's national ICF program, which includes the Nova and Beamlet (LLNL), OMEGA (University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics), Nike (Naval Research Laboratory), and Trident (Los Alamos National Laboratory) laser facilities. The Particle Beam Fusion Accelerator (Z) and Saturn pulsed-power facilities are at Sandia National Laboratories. General Atomics, Inc., develops and provides many of the targets for the above experimental facilities. Many of the ICF Annual Report articles are co-authored with our colleagues from these other ICF institutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} of the EBIT (Electron Beam Ion Trap) program in N Division of the Physics and Space Technology Directorate at LLNL continues to contribute significantly {{to the understanding of}} physical processes with low energy highly charged ions in atomic physics, plasma physics, and material science. Low-energy highly charged ions (up to U 92 +), provided by the EBIT facilities, provide a unique laboratory opportunity to study high field effects in atomic structures and dynamic interaction processes. The formation, existence, and structure of highly charged ions in astrophysical environments and laboratory plasmas make highly charged ions desirable for diagnosing various plasma conditions. The strong interaction of highly charged ions with matter and the response of solid surfaces make them a sensitive analysis tool and possibly a future capability for materials modifications at the atomic scale (nano technology). These physical applications require a good understanding and careful study of the dynamics of the interactions of the ions with complex systems. The EBIT group hosted an international conference and a workshop on trapped charged particles. The various talks and discussions showed that physics research with trapped charged particles is a very active and attractive area of innovative research, and provides a basis for research efforts in new areas. It also became obvious that the EBIT/RETRAP project has unique capabilities to perform important new experiments with trapped very highly charged ions at rest, which are complementary to and competitive with research at heavy ion storage rings and other trapping facilities planned or in operation in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Atomic structure research at EBIT provides ever better and more experimental complete benchmark data, supplying data needed to improve atomic theories. Research highlights through 1996 and 1997 include hyperfine structure measurements in H-like ions, QED studies, lifetime and polarization measurements on high-Z highly charged ions. Studies of the interaction of highly charged ions with solid surfaces and thin foil targets reveal new interaction phenomena. The measurements of high secondary ion sputter yields {{led to the development of}} a prototype electron/ion emission microscope, which allows simultaneous topographic and chemical composition analysis with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The enabling technology to trap, confine, and cool hundreds of highly charged ions in a precision Penning trap has been established and first evidence for the formation of a strongly coupled highly charged ion plasma via a sympathetic laser/ion cooling scheme has been observed. The benefits to DOE programs for a continued long term EBIT program are evident. The program requires the application and development of state-of-the-art experimental techniques necessary for spectroscopy, ion confinement and manipulation with <b>spin-off</b> <b>applications</b> in other laboratory programs. Thus, it serves as an excellent training ground for young scientists who will later work on energy-related plasma research or similar areas. It promises new research results towards the growth of our understanding of basic physics phenomena in atomic, nuclear and plasma physics, such as solid phases, astrophysical plasma evolution, and quantum control. This reserach will also provide input for applications in areas like ion beam manipulation and control for materials research. The activities at EBIT have created great interest among scientists from other areas (e. g. biology and environmental sciences) with several new ideas and research directions emerging. External funding for the project has in part been provided by the DOE office of Basic Energy Science (Chemical Science Division) and by NASA...|$|R
