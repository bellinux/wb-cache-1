40|$|Path {{integration}} enables desert arthropods to find back {{to their}} nest on the shortest track from any position. To perform path integration successfully, speeds and turning angles along the preceding outbound path have to be measured continuously and combined to determine an internal global vector leading back home at any time. A number of experiments have given an idea how arthropods might use allothetic or idiothetic signals to perceive their orientation and moving speed. We systematically review the four possible model descriptions of mathematically precise path integration, whereby we favour and elaborate the hitherto not used variant of egocentric cartesian coordinates. Its simple and intuitive structure is demonstrated {{in comparison to the}} other models. Measuring two speeds, the forward moving speed and the <b>angular</b> <b>turning</b> rate, and implementing them into a linear system of differential equations provides the necessary information during outbound route, reorientation process and return path. In addition, we propose several possible types of systematic errors that can cause deviations from the correct homeward course. Deviations have been observed for several species of desert arthropods in different experiments, but their origin is still under debate. Using our egocentric path integration model we propose simple error indices depending on path geometry that will allow future experiments to rule out or corroborate certain error types.

Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting. The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} desert ants to gauge the ground distances of sloped sections in a three-dimensional (3 D) outbound path. Ground distance estimation, {{as opposed to a}} simple measurement of walking distances, is a necessary prerequisite for precise path integration in undulating terrain. We trained ants to visit a feeder along a path that included an <b>angular</b> <b>turn</b> as well as a 'hill', resulting in an outbound path with a distinct 3 D structure. We then observed the ants' return path in a test field on level ground. From the angles of the ants' return path on the test field one can infer which property of the hill segment was fed into the ants' path integration module, the actual walking distance or the ground distance. The results show clearly that it is the ground distance that Cataglyphis fortis feeds into its path integrator, and suggest that the ants are able to keep an accurate home vector also in hilly terrain...|$|R

Considering the fact that participants had to reason the direction in the featureless corridor, two hypotheses were proposed: (i) reasoning about directions falls into qualitative reasoning by using a small number of coarse angular categories (four 90 ° categories or eight 45 ° categories: 90 ° categories consist of front, back, left, right; 45 ° categories consist of 90 ° categories and the four intermediates) that reference axes generate; (ii) reasoning about directions would be done by recalling the rotation angle from the traveling direction to the direction that participants tried to answer. In addition, the configuration of reference axes that participants employed was examined. Both hypotheses were supported, and the data designated that reference axes consisted of eight directions: a pair of orthogonal axes and diagonals. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main problem}} that appears with {{tracking}} high-performance targets is the severe random {{change in the}} target motion in the model used by a uni-modal filter; e. g., Kalman filter. The interacting multiple model (IMM) {{can be considered as}} a multi-modal approach that solves Kalman filter problems with nonlinear target models. Though, it still requires prior knowledge about the target model as well as limited to white Gaussian noise. An adaptive filter that is able to deal with nonlinear models as well as colored noise is the particle filter. The efficiency and accuracy of the particle filter and its extensions depend mainly on two key factors: the propagation function used to re-allocate the particles and the number of particles used to estimate the posterior distribution. High performance targets with maneuverability that exceeds 7 g need more particles to be tracked successfully. On the other hand, more particles mean more complexities in the tracking algorithm. In this paper, high-performance targets are tracked by fuzzy logic particle filter (FLPF); which uses fuzzy logic systems (FLS), to track targets when they start to maneuver. It estimates the <b>angular</b> <b>turn</b> rate, which is included as a state component, and tunes dynamically the number of particles used to estimate the posterior distribution. Meanwhile, when the target is moving according to a linear model, the unscented Kalman filter is used to track it.
