5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to the Sunrise Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E
5|$|North of Ann Arbor, {{the freeway}} runs through {{woodlands}} and near several lakes. In {{the community of}} Whitmore Lake, US23 crosses into Livingston County near the city's namesake body of water. East of Brighton, the freeway intersects I-96 and continues north to an intersection with M-59 south of Hartland. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs toward the city of Fenton. The trunkline passes through town <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> back toward the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches {{the south side of}} the Flint area.|$|E

5|$|Starting at {{its western}} {{terminus}} at the Vienna/Fairfax-GMU station in Virginia, the tracks {{run on the}} median strip of Interstate 66 until they enter a tunnel under Fairfax Drive just before the Ballston-MU station. Although originally proposed to follow I-66 through Arlington, city planners successfully argued that the line be relocated to Fairfax Drive, which has since stimulated high rise development along the line's route. At the Clarendon station, the tunnel shifts to Wilson Blvd. and 16th Street North. The tunnel then turns north and merges with the Blue Line just before entering the Rosslyn station which is located under North Lynn Street. The tunnel continues under the Potomac River <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> to the east to travel under I Street NW in the District of Columbia.|$|E

At Bercilak's castle, Gawain is submitted to tests of his loyalty and chastity, wherein Bercilak sends his wife to seduce Gawain and arranges that each time Bercilak gains prey in hunting, or Gawain any gift in the castle, each shall exchange his gain for the other's. At New Year's Day, Gawain departs to the Green Chapel, <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> to receive his blow, {{only to have the}} Green Knight feint two blows, then barely nick him on the third.

5|$|RE11 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with FM 1929, {{to the north}} of a small farm. The roadway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward through rural areas on a large peninsula on the lake. The road continues north, traveling through scrub land before it intersects the Ray Stoker Jr. Highway, <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> slightly northeast for a short distance. After continuing north, the roadway bends northeast, as it intersects the former route of RM 2134. The highway intersects a small road leading to a residential community on the lake, before continuing northeast, where it intersects County Road 4763 (CR 4763), which leads to a small residential area. It turns north and continues for a short distance, after which the highway bends northwest, and proceeds to its northern terminus, a boat-launch ramp on the coast of the lake. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} a numerical study of a cold-formed steel beam known as LiteSteel Beam (LSB) subject to combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions. The LSB sections are produced by a patented manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and electric resistance welding. They have a unique shape of a channel beam with two rectangular hollow flanges. To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the strength of LSB sections under combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions. Hence a numerical study was undertaken to investigate the behaviour and strength of LSBs subject to combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions. In this research, finite element models of LSBs were developed to simulate the combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour <b>and</b> strength of LSBs. They were then validated by comparing their results with test results and used in a parametric study. Both experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the current design equations are not suitable for combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> capacities of LSBs. Hence improved design equations are proposed for the capacities of LSBs subject to combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions...|$|R

5|$|The Kansas Turnpike then leaves Lawrence <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> to the {{northeast}} before leaving Douglas County and entering Leavenworth. It overpasses Mud Creek before passing under K-32. Northeast of here at mile 209, the Lawrence Service Area {{is located in the}} median. Afterward, the turnpike has a diamond interchange with 222nd Street, which is signed as Leavenworth County Road 1, at Exit 212 (Tonganoxie/Eudora). The highway then travels northeast and passes through it eastern terminal toll booth. This is the final toll booth on the route travelling east and all vehicles must pay their final toll before continuing. The turnpike then enters Bonner Springs. It crosses Wolf Creek before leaving Leavenworth County and entering Wyandotte County. In Bonner Springs, the turnpike intersects K-7, westbound US-24, westbound US-40, and the southern terminus of US-73 at Exit 224 (Bonner Springs, formerly Exit 223) with a trumpet interchange. The mileposts on the route switch to match those of I-70 after this interchange.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} Missouri, Route 144 begins at Route 32 in Millers. The route intersects Miller Switch Road <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> south. It heads south-southeast through rural land, {{crossing}} Janca Creek and approaching Hawn State Park. The road then enters into forests as it {{heads toward the}} park. Upon reaching Hawn Park Road, Route 144 turns eastward and parallels the northern boundary of the park. The road enters the park <b>and</b> <b>bends</b> northward slightly before terminating at Bauer Road. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated 152 vehicles traveling near the western terminus. This is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.
