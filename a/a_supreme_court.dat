5|$|In January 1900, Taft {{was called}} to Washington to meet with McKinley. Taft hoped <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{appointment}} was in the works, but instead McKinley wanted to place Taft on the commission to organize a civilian government in the Philippines. The appointment would require Taft's resignation from the bench; the president assured {{him that if he}} fulfilled this task, McKinley would appoint him to the next vacancy on the high court. Taft accepted on condition he was made head of the commission, with responsibility for success or failure; McKinley agreed, and Taft sailed for the islands in April 1900.|$|E

The judicial system has been changed several times since Malawi gained independence in 1964. Conventional courts and traditional courts have been used in varying combinations, with varying degrees of success and corruption.|$|E
5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>court</b> trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister Jos√© Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation of public funds to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E

Any questions as to membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E
5|$|In 1851 the Supreme Court was reorganized {{under the}} new state constitution. The {{position}} of justice was changed from an appointed position to an elected one. Judicial terms were changed to six years and the Court's size was set to {{a minimum of three}} members and not more than five. The Court's judges quickly became overwhelmed by an ever-increasing caseload. In 1853 the minimum was increased to four members and in 1872 it was increased to five. The Court has remained at a minimum of five justices since that time. In 1867 the general assembly transferred all the law books in the Indiana State Library to the Court to create <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Law Library. The library grew to become the primary legal library for the state and includes more than seventy-thousand volumes.|$|E

With slight variation, the body to meet in that form until 1776, when Maryland, now a state independent of British rule, passed a new constitution that created an electoral college to appoint members of the Senate. This electoral college was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City. In 1972, because of <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> decision, the number of districts was increased to 47, and the districts were balanced by population rather than being geographically determined.|$|E

Urging Homer and Marge to enforce stronger discipline on Bart {{with the idea}} that he could grow up to become <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Justice if he turns his life around, the two return home to find that Bart stole and broke Grampa's false teeth. Therefore, Bart is sent up to his room without dinner as punishment, but Homer sneaks up and brings him some pizza, making Bart promise to behave. However, Bart continues to get in trouble and Homer's attempts to discipline him fail. Eventually he promises Marge to make the next punishment stick.|$|E

5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC.

5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} to achieve {{geographic}} balance, nineteen states have never produced <b>a</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Justice. Some states have been over-represented (although partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed), with New York producing fifteen justices, Ohio producing ten, Massachusetts nine, Virginia eight, six each from Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and five from Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey. A handful of justices were born outside the United States, mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court. These included James Wilson, born in Fife, Scotland; James Iredell, born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson, born in County Antrim, Ireland. Justice David Josiah Brewer was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now ƒ∞zmir, Turkey). George Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born Justice, {{and the only one}} of these for whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter, born in Vienna, Austria.
