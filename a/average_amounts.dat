500|$|On June21, large swells {{of up to}} [...] {{caused a}} 498-tonne oil tanker, the Colombo Queen, to run aground in {{southern}} Taiwan. Rescue crews were unable to reach the ship as {{it was still in}} the storm. Although no fuel was reported to have leaked, the ship struck a coral reef, damaging the coral. Once Linfa passed, rescuers were able to reach the nine crew members on the ship. Officials estimated that it would take over a week to remove all [...] of fuel from the tanker. In Taiwan, two people were hit by fallen trees and two monks were struck by a wall that collapsed during a ceremony. Rip currents in Taiwan resulted in one death after a boy went into the water unwatched. Six hikers also went missing. Power to all 505 residences of Chiangchun was also lost during the storm. <b>Average</b> <b>amounts</b> of [...] of rain were recorded across southeastern parts of Taiwan on June21. The highest total was [...] in Taitung. Further rainfall of [...] fell on June22, pushing totals over [...] in isolated areas along southeastern areas. In Kinmen County, 50 trees were downed, six billboards were destroyed and two homes lost their roofs. By June22, power companies reported that 2,834 residents had lost power in Wuqiu Township for several hours. Severe damage was reported in the agricultural sector in Taiwan, leaving NT$400million (US$12.1million) in losses.|$|E

According to the study, [...] "for the first time, sufficient loss occurred to reasonably be described as an Arctic ozone hole." [...] The study analyzed data from the Aura and CALIPSO satellites, and determined that the larger-than-normal ozone loss was due to an unusually long period of cold weather in the Arctic, some 30 days more than typical, which allowed for more ozone-destroying chlorine compounds to be created. According to Lamont Poole, a co-author of the study, cloud and aerosol particles on which the chlorine compounds are found [...] "were abundant in the Arctic until mid March 2011—much later than usual—with <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> at some altitudes similar to those observed in the Antarctic, and dramatically larger than the near-zero values seen in March in most Arctic winters".|$|E

50|$|The law {{of value}} (German: Wertgesetz) {{is a central}} concept in Karl Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, first expounded in his polemic The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) against Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, with reference to David Ricardo's economics. Most generally, it refers to a regulative principle of the economic exchange of the products of human work: the relative exchange-values of those products in trade, usually expressed by money-prices, are proportional to the <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> of human labor-time which are currently socially necessary to produce them.|$|E
50|$|Excess demand {{can raise}} the prices of {{products}} traded, and excess supply can lower them; but if supply and demand are relatively balanced, the question arises of what regulates the settled exchange-ratios (or average price-levels) of products traded in that case, {{and this is what}} the law of value is intended to explain. According to the law of value, the trading ratios of different types of products reflect a real cost structure of production, and this cost structure ultimately reduces to the socially <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> of human labor-time required to produce different goods and services.|$|E

A five-day menu used by the Latin American Civic Association Head Start Program was evaluated and children attending one morning program and children attending one afternoon program were observed in the study to determine the amount of food consumed. The amount of food designated on the menu as a portion size was analyzed and the <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of food actually consumed by the children was analyzed for nutrient content by computer. The <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of food in the five-day menu for both the morning and afternoon program met the nutritional goal of one-third of the RDA for kilocalories, protein, iron, calcium, phosphorous, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin C, niacin and vitamin B 12. The <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of food in the morning five-day menu also met the nutritional goal for vitamin B 6. Neither menus contained proper amounts of food to meet the nutritional goal for zinc or folacin. The <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of food consumed by the morning and afternoon group of children met the nutritional goal for protein, iron, calcium, phosphorous, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin C. The <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of food consumed by the morning group also met the nutritional goal for vitamin B 12. Neither group consumed an <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of food which provided the nutritional goal for calories, zinc, niacin, vitamin B 6 or folacin.

30|$|As far as {{the impact}} of loan amount on total monthly income of the {{households}} is concerned, it {{is evident from the}} (Table 5) that there is negative relation between them. Total income rises by Rs. 0.151 with one rupee reduction in loan amount disbursed by the target Islamic Microfinance institutions. It is already mentioned in the study that the <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of loan offered by Akhuwat Foundation,NAYMET and Farz Foundation is Rs 21, 375, Rs. 16, 120 and Rs. 11, 823 respectively. Table 3 portrays that the <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of income earned, after taking loan, by a household is 24, 002, 26, 550 and 30, 540 for the clients of Akhuwat Foundation, NAYMET and Farz Foundation respectively. These results indicate that the higher the loan amount the lower is the amount of income generated. Akhuwat Foundation lends highest <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of loan (Rs. 21, 375) which generates lowest <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of income (Rs. 24, 002) while Farz Foundation offers lowest <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of loan (Rs. 11, 823) which generates highest <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of income (Rs. 30, 540). This is the reason that loan amount is in inverse relationship with income (Table 5). The inverse relationship between loan amount and total income seems surprising but it can be better understood and justified by law of diminishing returns (i.e. increase in output is proportionately smaller as compared to input after a certain level). Therefore it will be worth investigating in some future research endeavor to observeand estimate appropriate amount of loans for better socio-economic uplift of the society.|$|R
50|$|Unlike typical known {{extraterrestrial}} impact structures, Shiva is teardrop shaped, roughly 600 x 400 km. It is also unusually rectangular. Chatterjee {{argues that}} the low angle of an impact combined with boundary fault lines and unstable rock led to this unusual formation. The crater also is reported to contain larger than <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> of alkaline melt rocks, shocked quartz, and iron oxide laced with iridium. These types of rocks and features suggest an impact origin. The age of the crater is inferred from the Deccan traps, which contain relatively high amounts of iridium (an element extremely rare in the Earth's crust but more common in asteroids).|$|E

By the 19th century, then-sufficient sunspot records allowed researchers to infer periodic cycles in sunspot activity. In 1845, Henry and Alexander observed the Sun with a thermopile and determined that sunspots emitted less radiation than surrounding areas. The emission of higher than <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> of radiation later were observed from the solar faculae.Sunspots had some importance in the debate over the nature of the Solar System.

50|$|Perception of peers’ sexual {{attitudes and}} {{behaviour}} {{can increase the}} amount of sexual content watched by adolescents; this, in turn, can influence sexual behavior. Believing that one’s friends approve of sexual activity and have a high level of non-coital sexual experience predicts heavier viewing of sexual material, relative to other types of television. Collins and colleagues found a relationship between the amount of sexual content in television viewed and sexual behavior in adolescents. Adolescents who viewed one standard deviation more sexual content than average showed sexual behavior similar to adolescents, 9 to 17 months older, who viewed an average amount of sexual programming. Adolescents who viewed the highest level of televised sexual content doubled the likelihood of initiating intercourse within the following year, compared to adolescents who viewed <b>average</b> <b>amounts.</b> However, the inability to control for prior interest in sex before television viewing may affect the accuracy of the results.|$|E
