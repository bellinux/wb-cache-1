50|$|Civil {{society and}} certain media outlets also took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> against the bills, {{and claimed that}} the government's {{reasoning}} for these bills conceals an intent to pardon convicted politicians and cease ongoing cases against accused politicians.|$|R
50|$|The young lawyer’s name, Charvaka, is a {{reference}} to the ancient Indian atheist Cārvāka, said to have founded the first atheist system of Indian philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference.

Subsequently, she published the book Modi, Muslims and Media, documenting <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance.</b>|$|R
5|$|Opposition {{political}} parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished. In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, which allow arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions, should be enacted to replace the ISA. The National Solidarity Party took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> in February 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 1999, the National Academy of Sciences adopted <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance.</b> Its {{publication}} Science and Creationism {{stated that}} [...] "Scientists, like many others, are touched with {{awe at the}} order and complexity of nature. Indeed, many scientists are deeply religious. But science and religion occupy two separate realms of human experience. Demanding that they be combined detracts from the glory of each." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Yugoslav authorities, under Slobodan Milošević, {{regarded}} the KLA as terrorist group, though many European governments did not. In February 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton's {{special envoy to}} the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, condemned both {{the actions of the}} Serb government and of the KLA, and described the KLA as [...] "without any questions, a terrorist group". UN resolution 1160 took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Liberal Democrats took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> to the Conservatives, {{and were}} {{also of the}} opinion that setting targets every five years would be an abdication of responsibility, because a {{government}} typically remains in power for only four years.

50|$|The centre-right, liberal-conservative Coalition Avenir Quebec or CAQ, led {{by former}} PQ cabinet {{minister}} Francois Legault, is now opposed to sovereignty but takes a moderate nationalist approach to identity and favours strongly a primary role for Quebec in its internal affairs.

50|$|The NAACP {{has taken}} <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> and has cited {{the same data}} used by the ACLU. The NAACP has been strong {{supporters}} of the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act - H.R. 1523 and has reached out {{to members of congress}} to get this act passed. This act is designed to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana possession and supports prohibiting federal enforcement of marijuana laws in states which have lesser penalties.|$|R
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance.</b> The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|R
40|$|Common Law, {{as practiced}} around the world, permits what it doesn't prohibit. Compared to Roman Law practice, which prohibits what it doesn't permit, the Common Law makes {{economic}} innovation easy. Easy economic innovation, in turn, promotes rapid economic adaptation [...] broad technological improvements in goods, services, and processes. Since faster economic adaptation rates in Common Law countries {{stem from the}} Common Law's prior permission, Roman Law countries could raise their economic adaptation rates by adopting <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Damien Cave of the New York Times, who {{has called}} Powhida the [...] "gadfly {{of the art}} establishment," [...] {{has pointed out that}} the artist's own rising fame {{presents}} a problem for an artist who critiques the art market as feudal and celebrity obsessed. New York dealer-turned Museum of Contemporary Art director Jeffrey Deitch takes <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance,</b> saying, [...] "The irony is that by exposing art celebrity culture, he's becoming a celebrity himself... So hats off to him." ...|$|R
50|$|Amongst the Ashkenazi Orthodox rabbinical leadership, {{religious}} Zionists form a minority. Generally speaking, most Sephardi Haredi {{authorities have}} never shared the anti-Zionism of their Ashkenazi counterparts, and some (such {{as the late}} Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu) are strongly affiliated with Religious Zionism, taking <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> to the Hardal movements.. However, there are anti-Zionist elements in the Sefardic communities as well. It is known that the late Baba Sali supported and celebrated the anti-Zionist views of the Satmar Rebbe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{group has}} been {{involved}} in a free speech case involving the then-ANC Youth leader Julius Malema and the singing of [...] "Shoot the boer" [...] song, which according to them made many Afrikaners feel degraded and believed it to [...] "incite harm against" [...] whites. The song was later banned as hate speech by South Africa's high court. AfriForum adopted <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> towards the word Kaffir, arguing that it should not be used at all.|$|R
2500|$|The California Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Kahn v.

5000|$|Negri and Hardt take <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance,</b> {{arguing that}} the {{intertwined}} network of interests in the global capitalism leads to the decline of individual nation states, {{and the rise of}} a global Empire which has no outside, and no external enemies. As a result, they write, [...] "The era of imperialist, interimperialist, and anti-imperialist wars is over. (...) we have entered the era of minor and internal conflicts. Every imperial war is a civil war, a police action." [...] (Hardt & Negri 2000).|$|R
2500|$|John Locke {{denied that}} the phrase [...] "free will" [...] made any sense (compare with {{theological}} noncognitivism, <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> {{on the existence of}} God). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to postpone a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: [...] "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".|$|R
50|$|Many of Shaykh Yusuf al-Nabahani's poems, books, and teachings have remained, {{but very}} little is printed about his {{personal}} life, and activities. What is known is that he worked and campaigned against the Wahhabi movement and the reformers in Cairo like Muhammad Abduh and al-Afghani who were changing Sunni Islam. Yusuf was {{a firm believer in}} the law, or Shariah in restricting all Sufi activity, being of the Shafi madhab or thought of Sunni Islam holding <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> to al-Ghazali in his later years on Sufism.|$|R

5000|$|PCB took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance,</b> {{saying they}} will [...] "defeat Serra on the ballots and Dilma on the streets". PSTU, {{in the other}} hand, {{advocated}} the null voting on the second round. PV held a convention, {{where most of the}} 92 voting members decided that the party should stay neutral in the second round. Party members were free to support either of the two candidates, but they were forbidden to use flags or other party symbols. If they did so, they could have been punished with disaffiliation.|$|R
2500|$|This {{contrasts}} readings by Caracostea and Tudor Vianu, {{who see the}} Morning Star as primarily angelic—if {{he appears}} [...] "handsome as a daemon" [...] during his second incarnation, it is because passion has momentarily transfigured him.

50|$|No openly LGBT Russian {{has been}} elected to the parliament. The United Russia, Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the A Just Russia are the four major {{political}} parties in Russia {{and they tend to}} ignore LGBT-rights issues or endorse a socially conservative <b>stance</b> in opposition. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> tends to be taken with the smaller political parties.

5000|$|Kenton Smith, from Uptown, reiterates <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance.</b> He {{states that}} the archeologists and astronomers (archeologists being the historians of what’s {{underneath}} the earth and astronomers being the archeologist of the cosmos) have the most in common as they both recreate the past. The documentary is praised for its stunning visuals and impressive views of the cosmos but despite the aesthetics, it evokes the idea that we, according to Smith, “concern ourselves with fleeting power and evil deeds, treating both {{as though they are}} more than mere smudges on a much larger blueprint.” ...|$|R
5000|$|With a 60% majority, the Amherst College faculty {{rejected}} {{the opportunity to}} work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the [...] "information dispensing" [...] teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading. The Duke University faculty took <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> in the spring of 2013.

40|$|Abstract: The {{literature}} in economic methodology has witnessed {{an increase in}} the number of studies which, drawing upon the postmodern turn in social sciences, pay serious attention to the non-epistemologicaldiscursive elements of economic theorizing. This recent work on the “economic discourse ” has thus added a new dimension to economic methodology by analyzing various discursive aspects of the construction of scientific meanings in economics. Taking <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance,</b> this paper explores Michel Foucault’s archaeological analysis of scientific discourses. It aims to show that his archaeological reading of the history of economic thought provides <b>an</b> <b>articulate</b> nonepistemological framework for the analysis of the discursive elements in the history of economics and contemporary economic theorizing...|$|R

However, in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in mala fides situations until a case with a mala fides factual situation arises.

30|$|Research {{and theory}} suggest that macro-level {{variables}} filtrate through more proximate {{circumstances in which}} children and adolescents grow up (Bronfenbrenner 1979). In case of the acculturation process, <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>stance</b> has been put forward by Bourhis et al. (1997) in their Interactive Acculturation Model (IAM). The IAM claims an interactionist relationship {{between the individual and}} the acculturative context: State policies and other circumstantial conditions affect individuals’ acculturation orientations and also the outcomes that emerge from different combinations of contextual conditions and individual-level acculturation orientations. Hence, when examining the process of acculturation, its conditions, orientations and outcomes, it seems inevitable to take contextual variables into account.|$|R
