5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front <b>axle.</b> These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank <b>axle</b> with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front <b>axle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting tandem <b>axle,</b> {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore <b>axle</b> using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front <b>axle</b> and a tandem <b>axle</b> with a driven fore <b>axle,</b> called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled <b>axle</b> for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled <b>axle</b> for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, {{the company}} moved its <b>axle</b> {{production}} from Helsinki {{to a new}} factory at Hämeenlinna. In 1995, <b>axle</b> production was separated into an independent unit called Sisu Axles; this was sold to investors in 1999. The main factory builds military vehicles; the state separated it from the parent company in 1996 and renamed it Patria Vehicles Oy. Its main products are Patria AMV armoured personnel carriers.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live <b>axle</b> rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear <b>axle</b> was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{suburban}} electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115km/h, with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130km/h {{on the same}} track, and up to 160km/h on specified lines. The maximum <b>axle</b> loading of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne <b>axle</b> loading operating. Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>axles</b> are {{produced}} by Sisu <b>Axles.</b> The steering front <b>axles</b> are type FSND-10-P with maximum ten tonnes capacity and disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|Sisu <b>Axles</b> is {{specialised}} on highly customised {{heavy vehicle}} <b>axles</b> in niché markets. The <b>axles</b> are designated {{to be used}} in rough conditions.|$|R
500|$|There is one {{exception}} to the formula: two consecutive sets of tandem <b>axles</b> may carry [...] each if the overall distance {{between the first and}} last <b>axles</b> of these tandems is [...] or more. For example, a five-axle truck may carry 34,000pounds both on the tractor tandem <b>axles</b> (2 and 3) and the trailer tandem <b>axles</b> (4 and 5), provided <b>axles</b> 2 and 5 are spaced at least [...] apart.|$|R
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the <b>axle</b> box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one <b>axle.</b> In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|MACS was {{initially}} tested out at two truck inspection stations in Kentucky, with transponders installed in 220trucks. Exact time, date, location, weight and <b>axle</b> data were logged as a truck approached an equipped station.|$|E
5|$|The Cab {{and drive}} <b>axle</b> {{portion of a}} large {{capacity}} truck and trailer. Since {{the primary purpose of}} the Cab is to pull the trailer, it is rightly referred to as a tractor. The various kinds of tractors are Yard, Day, and Sleepers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} monthly fees {{were for}} {{three types of}} vehicles and the rates per month for [...] "tractor-trains" [...] of 7 <b>axles</b> or more was $275, [...] "tractor-trailers" [...] of 4-6 <b>axles</b> paid $150, and trucks with 2-3 <b>axles</b> paid $75. These rates were for registered users with transponders; single-use permits had an additional $16.25 service charge. The toll rates were later changed to cover four types of commercial vehicles {{based on the number}} of <b>axles.</b> Toll rates have increased based on inflation and as of April 1, 2016 the tolls had risen to $78 for 2 to 4 <b>axles,</b> $157 for 5 or 6 <b>axles,</b> $289 for 7 or 8 <b>axles</b> and $380 for 9 <b>axles</b> or more. The corresponding charges for single use are $97, $175, $307 and $398.|$|R

50|$|All Dana 50 TTB <b>axles</b> were leaf sprung <b>axles.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hotshot vehicle or {{truck is}} {{essentially}} a pick-up with a larger load capacity than a personal truck. Hotshots are typically single <b>axle</b> 1-ton to 3-ton trucks, which can be either a dual or single tire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and <b>axle</b> (or <b>axle</b> and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|CMVs are {{required}} to pass through weigh stations at the borders of most states and some large cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and <b>axle</b> weight using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.|$|E
50|$|There is one {{exception}} to the formula: two consecutive sets of tandem <b>axles</b> may carry 34000 lb each if the overall distance {{between the first and}} last <b>axles</b> of these tandems is 36 ft or more. For example, a five-axle truck may carry 34,000 pounds both on the tractor tandem <b>axles</b> (2 and 3) and the trailer tandem <b>axles</b> (4 and 5), provided <b>axles</b> 2 and 5 are spaced at least 36 ft apart.|$|R
50|$|First {{and second}} <b>axles</b> are steerable, all the <b>axles</b> are driving.|$|R
50|$|The {{class was}} so named under the Swiss {{locomotive}} and railcar classification system. According to that system, G 2/3+2/3 denotes a two bogie narrow gauge steam locomotive, {{with the front}} bogie being fitted with three <b>axles,</b> two of them drive <b>axles,</b> and the rear bogie having only two <b>axles,</b> both of them drive <b>axles.</b>|$|R
5|$|FF Developments, in {{addition}} to their design work on the gearbox and rear <b>axle</b> assembly were given responsibility for their manufacture. The aluminium chassis components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including chassis and body components, consists of approximately 3000 unique parts.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was {{more powerful than the}} P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter <b>axle</b> load and to be double-ended with a cab {{in the center of the}} carbody. Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E
5|$|The SL79 make up 40 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the newer}} SL95. Following the {{delivery}} of the SL95 low-floor trams in 1999 and 2000, Oslo Sporveier has a pure articulated fleet. The newer series has a greater turning radius, heavier <b>axle</b> load and is two-directional. The radius and <b>axle</b> load of the SL95 {{makes it impossible for}} it to operate around Majorstuen, requiring lines 11, 12 and 19 to use SL79-units. With the 1999-extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet, the tramway received its first terminus without a balloon loop, making it necessary for lines 17 and 18 to be served only by SL95 units. These also serve line 13, since it is a continuation of the service along the Sinsen Line from Majorstuen. The SL79 operate on the Briskeby, Ekeberg, Frogner, Gamleby, Grünerløkka–Torshov, Kjelsås and Vika Lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
5000|$|G 2/3+2/2 denotes a two bogie {{narrow gauge}} steam locomotive, {{with the front}} bogie having three <b>axles,</b> two of them drive <b>axles,</b> and the other bogie being fitted with just two drive <b>axles.</b>|$|R

50|$|In Scout IIs, Dana 30 front <b>axles</b> and Dana 44 rear <b>axles</b> were {{standard}} until 1974, with front Dana 44 <b>axles</b> as {{a special}} order. After 1974 Dana 44 front and rear <b>axles</b> became standard on all Scout IIs. Available gear ratios were 2.72, 3.07, 3.31, 3.54, 3.73, 4.09, 4.27 and 4.54. Trak-Lok limited slip differentials were optional.|$|R
5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the <b>axle</b> bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{use for the}} Di 3 was {{to operate}} the three non-electrified long-distance lines of NSB: the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line. Following the {{delivery}} of the first batch in 1957, they were from 2 June used on the Dovre Line, north of Otta to Trondheim, and further north along the Nordland Line to Mo i Rana. The stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland Line, and reduced travel time by one hour. From Hamar to Otta, the track did not have sufficient permitted <b>axle</b> load. From the second batch of eight units, five were put into service on the Bergen Line, the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines. Necessary upgrades of the permitted <b>axle</b> load {{had been made to}} the Dovre Line and Nordland Line, and the locomotives were in use from Hamar to Saltdal. On 30 November, the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske, and the full length operated with Di 3.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an <b>axle</b> broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front <b>axle</b> load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{the formula}} A × B × C is used. Even if the {{information}} contained by C is needless, it means that only front <b>axles</b> are steered. This can give information about the distribution of <b>axles.</b> For example, provide manufacturers the chassis configuration 8*4*4 {{to show that the}} vehicle has two steered front <b>axles</b> and two driven rear <b>axles</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The driving <b>axles</b> {{were fixed}} rigidly into the {{locomotive}} frame. To improve curve running the wheel flanges {{of the driving}} wheels were reduced. The carrying <b>axles</b> were designed as Adams <b>axles</b> and had leaf return springs.|$|R
50|$|Rear <b>axles</b> offered include tri-drive {{options and}} {{planetary}} hub reduction <b>axles</b> from Renault Trucks.|$|R
