They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms, some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus - phosphorus bonds.

One roundworm of note, Caenorhabditis elegans, lives in the soil and has found much use as a model organism. C. elegans has had its entire genome sequenced, as well as the developmental fate of every cell determined, and every neuron mapped.|$|E

25|$|As {{more women}} with Turner {{syndrome}} complete pregnancy thanks to modern techniques to treat infertility, {{it has to}} be noted that pregnancy may be a risk of cardiovascular complications for the mother. Indeed, several studies had suggested an increased risk for aortic dissection in pregnancy. The influence of estrogen has been examined but remains unclear. It seems that the high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy in women with Turner syndrome {{may be due to the}} increased hemodynamic load rather than the high estrogen rate. Of course, these findings <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> need to be remembered while following a pregnant patient with Turner syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for {{performing}} arthroscopies is to repair or trim a painful and torn or damaged meniscus. The technical terms for the surgery is arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Arthroscopic surgery, however, {{does not appear to}} result in benefits to adults when performed for knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis who have a meniscal tear. This {{may be due to the}} fact that a torn meniscus may often not cause pain and symptoms, which may be caused by the osteoarthritis alone. Some groups have made a strong recommendation against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in nearly all patients, stating that the only group of patients who may - or may not - benefit are those with a true locked knee. Professional knee societies, however, highlight other symptoms and related factors they believe <b>are</b> <b>important,</b> <b>and</b> continue to support limited use of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in carefully selected patients.|$|E

[...] The show consists of five women's monologues about wardrobe malfunctions, puberty's relationship with personal wardrobe, first date outfits, lucky underwear, prom dresses, favorite boots, irreplaceable shirts, the detested, disorganized purse, and experiences in the dressing room. The recollections about the clothing prompt the women's memories about their mothers, boyfriends, husbands, ex-husbands, sisters and grandchildren.|$|E

500|$|The {{leader of}} the Saint Rose Crusaders, [...] is never clearly {{identified}} within the series as being male or female but it is left to the readers to decide due to the ambiguous character designed used. Reviewers of the series found it both interesting and disturbing that Duke's clothing is similar in design to the white robes worn {{by members of the}} Ku Klux Klan (an American white supremacy group once led by a man named David Duke). Within a la Mode, Duke is not shown to have any racial prejudices– Duke instead appears before four ostracized children endowed with special powers, shunned by their families and societies because they were different. Duke, drawn by their loneliness and internal cries for help, takes them in, assures them that they <b>are</b> <b>important,</b> <b>and</b> helps them find a purpose in life. The manga suggests that Duke came up with the plan of using the remaining Chimera Anima to take over the world.|$|E
500|$|Wagman takes {{issue with}} the way Davis moves from topic to topic and time period to time period. [...] Davis gives long {{personal}} histories of the principal players in his history, but fails to explain the reason they <b>are</b> <b>important,</b> <b>and</b> is compelled to repeat every positive claim made about Sesame Street. [...] In spite of this, Wagman states, Davis demonstrates the love and respect Cooney and the show's cast and crew had for each another. [...] For example, when Calloway {{was diagnosed with a}} mental illness, the show never fired him, and Wagman calls Henson's funeral [...] "heartbreaking". [...] Gillespie finds the [...] "nasty backstage wrangling" [...] and behind-the-scenes stories compelling. [...] Alex Altman of Time Magazine agrees, and calls Davis [...] "an unabashed fan of the show's charms rather than a dispassionate historian". [...] He also considers Davis' use of language breathless and his portrayals of the show's creators overly flattering.|$|E
