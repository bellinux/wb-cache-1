To finance the enterprise he was granted a loan by the Duchy of Cornwall. In 1557 John Trelawny, John Tredeneck and Thomas Treffry were directed to take charge of the mines Kranich had discovered, and the Duchy of Cornwall advanced a loan of £600 to finance the enterprise. Although considerable lead was produced, the <b>anticipated</b> <b>production</b> of copper and silver did not materialise. The lead was sent to Treffry, who died in 1563, at which time it passed into the hands of his son, John, who refused to deliver it to Carnsew and Tredeneck, who had taken over the mines and were responsible for repayment of the loan. The outcome of a Chancery suit for recovery of the lead is not known.|$|E

50|$|It has {{sometimes}} been alleged that Triumph were instructed to use the proven all-aluminium Rover V8, originally designed by Buick, but claimed {{that it would not}} fit. Although there was a factory attempt by Triumph to fit a Rover engine, which was pronounced unsuccessful, the decision to go with the Triumph V8 was probably driven more by the wider engineering strategy and {{by the fact that the}} Buick's different weight and torque characteristics would have entailed substantial re-engineering of the Stag when it was almost ready to go on sale. Furthermore Rover, also owned by British Leyland, could not necessarily have supplied the numbers of V8 engines to match the <b>anticipated</b> <b>production</b> of the Stag anyway.|$|E

50|$|The Dreamers {{is set in}} {{the town}} of Sonoma at a time when California was no longer under Mexican control but not yet a state either (1848). In the opera, the Empress Isadora and Manuel Garcia - two social outcasts - sit around a campfire singing about the “lies and legends” of California when Sam, an African-American, enters. He asks the couple who owns the large house, which is {{standing}} behind them. Isadora and Garcia tell him that it is the house of General Vallejo - the former proprietor of California who lost everything during the infamous Bear Flag revolt (an incident about which he still has nightmares). And indeed, inside the house, the Vallejos are finding little sleep with tormenting visions of their past and present (so called “dreams that are real and wounds that will not heal.”). The following day is characterized by Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson’s Regiment of New York Volunteers’ largely <b>anticipated</b> <b>production</b> of Othello. The entire town filters over to the Colonnade Theatre where the show is about to start. As Sam approaches the entrance, he is denied admission because he is black. However, they eventually let him into the theatre and seat him in the Vallejos’ box to the bemusement of a gathering crowd. As the production of Othello begins, Johnny Rowe - who has been cast in the title role - is trying to keep the attention of a distracted audience that is now anxiously awaiting the arrival of the General Vallejo and his family. Though late, the Vallejos do indeed arrive only to find themselves the laughing stock of Sonoma. With the performance now completely disrupted, the actors stop and watch as the General launches a vicious racial attack upon Sam. The Vallejos, furious, begin to leave but reluctantly agree to stay after the entire audience apologizes. The crowd sings “My Old Kentucky Home” to break the tension, which allows the dreams of Sonoma to be shared, and the opera concludes with the town of Sonoma singing about the very nature of dreams.|$|E
