5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{attracted}} many reviews, {{with interest}} from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially {{the division of}} fauna and flora along what soon {{became known as the}} Wallace line, natural selection and uniformitarianism. Nearly all agreed that he had provided <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> comprehensive account of the geography, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was little known to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and as a piece of literature.|$|E

25|$|Weinrich's painting, Still Life, {{made about}} 1926, {{may have been}} shown in the 1927 show. Representative of some aspects of her mature style, it is modernist but does not show Cubist influence. The objects pictured are entirely recognizable, but treated abstractly. Although fore- and {{background}} are distinguishable, the objects, as colored forms, make <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> visually satisfying surface design.|$|E

25|$|Karachi, Pakistan's {{largest and}} most populous city, {{presents}} <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> colourful combination {{of the old and}} new. The National Stadium became Karachi's fifth and Pakistan's 11th first-class ground. The inaugural first-class match was played at NSK between Pakistan and India on 21–24 April 1955, and it became a fortress of Pakistan cricket. In 34 Tests between that first match and December 2000, Pakistan won 17 and were never beaten. Their only Test defeat on the ground came in the gloom against England in 2000–01.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} confusing {{fact about}} the Secretariat's internal organization {{is the use}} of a specially structured sequence of numbers to refer to different internal divisions. For example, the Undersecretariat of Interior Intelligence is numbered '8', and its dependencies, such as the Directorates of Counterintelligence and Judicial Surveillance are numbered '84' and '85' respectively. The same case applies for the Undersecretariat of Exterior Intelligence, or '3', its divisions go from '32' for the Directorate of Foreign Intelligence to '34' for the Division of Transnational Crime and International Terrorism.|$|E

25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for {{both public and private}} expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also have found in it <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> pleasurable field of study, in its exemplification of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and on its own terms.|$|E
25|$|Tides in the Chesapeake Bay exhibit <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> unique {{behavior}} due to {{the nature}} of the topography (both horizontal and vertical shape), wind driven circulation, and how the Bay interacts with oceanic tides. Research into the peculiar behavior of tides both at the northern and southern extents of the Bay began in the late 1970s. One study noted sea level fluctuations at periods of 5 days, driven by sea level changes at the Bay’s mouth on the Atlantic coast and local lateral winds, and 2.5 days, caused by resonant oscillations driven by local longitudinal winds, while another study later found that the geometry of the Bay permits for a resonant period of 1.46 days.|$|E
25|$|While {{acting as}} Governor of Xuzhou, Su Shi in 1078 AD wrote a {{memorial}} to the imperial court about problems faced in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture which was under his watch and administration. In <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> revealing passage about the Chinese iron industry during {{the latter half of}} the 11th century, Su Shi wrote about the enormous size of the workforce employed in the iron industry, competing provinces that had rival iron manufacturers seeking favor from the central government, as well as the danger of rising local strongmen who had the capability of raiding the industry and threatening the government with effectively armed rebellion. It also becomes clear in reading the text that prefectural government officials in Su's time often had to negotiate with the central government in order to meet the demands of local conditions.|$|E

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
25|$|While Heath/Zenith's {{computer}} {{business was}} successful, {{the growing popularity}} of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits. While their assembly was still <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products; BYTE reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 IBM PC compatible cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble. The continuation of the integration trend (printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to surface mount components and LSI ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in home automation and lighting products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.|$|E

500|$|On three {{occasions}} Merrick {{left the}} hospital and London on holiday, spending a few {{weeks at a time}} in the countryside. Through elaborate arrangements that allowed Merrick to board a train unseen and have an entire carriage to himself, he travelled to Northamptonshire to stay at Fawsley Hall, the estate of Lady Knightley. He stayed at the gamekeeper's cottage and spent the days walking in the estate's woods, collecting wild flowers. He befriended a young farm labourer who later recalled Merrick as <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> well-educated man. Treves called this [...] "the one supreme holiday of [...] life", although in fact there were three such trips.|$|E
500|$|Richard Eisenbeis at Kotaku found Takumi very unlikable, to {{the point}} of being unsure whether the player is meant to sympathize with him. He also noted that the game was short {{compared}} to the later Science Adventure games, and that the main characters never come together as a group and are not a vital part of Takumi's life, with Takumi instead [...] "wandering in and out of their stories". Despite this, he found the plot and world gripping, and said that the game was not bad, but that it [...] "might as well be nothing" [...] compared to Steins;Gate. Jenni Lada at TechnologyTell recommended the game, calling it <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> mature story, but noted its lack of an English release as unfortunate. Game Informer included Chaos;Head on a list of games they wanted to see localized; they considered a localized version likely due to Steins;Gate English release in 2014.|$|E
