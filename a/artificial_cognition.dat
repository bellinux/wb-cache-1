Biological <b>cognition</b> is here conceived and synthetically analyzed as a broadly extended and distributed dynamic process emerging from the interplay between body, environment and nervous system. Accordingly, we first analyze a minimalist case study where the ‘body’, through a very simple non-neural internal bio-regulatory system (an ‘energy level’), acts as a self-organized dynamic action selection mechanism. It modulates the activity of the neurocontroller as appropriate to the current context.

40|$|In {{order to}} reach higher degrees of flexibility, {{adaptability}} and autonomy in manufacturing systems, {{it is essential to}} develop new rescheduling methodologies which resort to cognitive capabilities, similar to those found in human beings. <b>Artificial</b> <b>cognition</b> is important for designing planning and control systems that generate and represent knowledge about heuristics for repairbased scheduling.

In this work, to achieve the aforementioned goals, a novel approach to generate rescheduling knowledge in the form of dynamic first-order logical rules is proposed. The proposed approach is based on the integration of reinforcement learning with artificial cognitive capabilities involving perception and reasoning/learning skills embedded in the Soar cognitive architecture.

40|$|Naturalized {{epistemology}} {{and artificial}} cognitive systems One {{of the obvious}} ways to start building artificial cognitive systems is to reuse existing theories of cognition. As philosophy abounds with such theories, {{it is not surprising}} that there are strong affinities between certain methodologies in AI and epistemology. For example, GOFAI approaches seem to be inspired by a view that knowledge is a formal, logical theory (as advanced by logical positivism). Connectionist approaches share a black-box behaviorist view on the cognitive agent. The current embedded and embodied AI is largely informed by phenomenological analysis of Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger, translated into engineering requirements. Evolutionary epistemology inspires attempts to evolve cognitive agents, etc. At the same time, there can be insights in the research on <b>artificial</b> <b>cognition</b> that help develop philosophical views in epistemology. For example, the philosophical discussion of the frame problem, though often off the mark from the AI point of view, has helped many philosophers recognise how vague their ideas on knowledge were (see, for example, Dennett 1984, Fodor 1987).

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{approach the}} problem of building autonomous systems by looking to biology for inspiration. This {{has given rise to}} a wide-range of artificial systems mimicking their biological counterparts—artificial neural networks, artificial endocrine systems, and artificial musculoskeletal systems are prime examples. While these systems are succinct and work well in isolation, they can become cumbersome and complicated when combined to perform more complex tasks. Autonomous behaviour is one such complex task. This thesis considers autonomy as the complex behaviour it is, and proposes a bottom-up approach to developing autonomous behaviour from cognition. This consists of investigating how cognition can provide new approaches to the current limitations of swarm systems, and using this as the basis for one type of autonomous behaviour: <b>artificial</b> homeostasis. Distributed <b>cognition,</b> a form of emergent cognition, is most often described in terms of the immune system and social insects. By taking inspiration from distributed cognition, this thesis details the development of novel algorithms for cognitive decision-making and emergent identity in leaderless, homogenous swarms. Artificial homeostasis is provided to a robot through an architecture that combines the cognitive decision-making algorithm with a simple associative memory.

40|$|Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) {{traditionally}} use a ternary encoding to generalise {{over the}} environmental inputs and to associate appropriate actions. However, {{a number of}} schemes have been presented beyond this, ranging from integers to artificial neural networks. This thesis investigates the use of Dynamical Genetic Programming (DGP) as a knowledge representation within LCS. DGP is a temporally dynamic, graph-based, symbolic representation. Temporal dynamism {{has been identified as}} an important aspect in biological systems, <b>artificial</b> life, and <b>cognition</b> in general. Furthermore, discrete dynamical systems have been found to exhibit inherent content-addressable memory. In this thesis, the collective emergent behaviour of ensembles of such dynamical function networks are herein shown to be exploitable toward solving various computational tasks. Significantly, it is shown possible to exploit the variable-length, adaptive memory existing inherently within the networks under an asynchronous scheme, and where all new parameters introduced are self-adaptive. It is shown possible to exploit the collective mechanics to solve both discrete and continuous-valued reinforcement learning problems, and to perform symbolic regression. In particular, the representation is shown to provide improved performance beyond a traditional Genetic Programming benchmark on a number of a composite polynomial regression tasks. Superior performance to previously published techniques is also shown in a continuous-input-output reinforcement learning problem. Finally, it is shown possible to perform multi-step-ahead predictions of a financial time-series by repeatedly sampling the network states at succeeding temporal intervals.
