5|$|In January and February 1554, Wyatt's {{rebellion}} broke out; it {{was soon}} suppressed. Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though {{it is unlikely that}} she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador Simon Renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, Stephen Gardiner, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including Lord Paget, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to Woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfield. Crowds cheered her <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

The Station is centrally located near the old (now redundant) railway station, which serves now as Metrocali's headquarters.

Recently, in their last float renovation wave, Colombian coaches operators have opted for Brazil's Marcopolo buses.

25|$|While {{scouting}} sixteen {{miles from}} Camp Wright on the Selvies River, near present-day Burns, Captain Loren L. Williams and {{a party of}} twenty Oregon infantrymen from Company H were ambushed by a band of hostile Indians. Williams and his troops fought a harrowing retreat back to Camp Wright, defending themselves for about fifteen hours before they reached safety. <b>All</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Indians fired from concealed positions. At one point, they even set a brush fire in the soldiers path {{to prevent them from}} escaping. Despite their continuous attacks, the Indians only wounded two soldiers. In his report, Williams stated that his long-range rifles killed fifteen Indians. He also stated that his superior weaponry {{was the only thing that}} prevented his party from being overrun.|$|E
25|$|Agents for the Tidewater Railway quietly struck {{deals with}} the landowners and various {{communities}} <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Many were small towns and villages that had been passed by when the big railroads were choosing routes and building 20–25 years earlier, and the new railroad was welcomed. At several key points, negotiations were especially sensitive. Roanoke was one such place, as the Norfolk & Western had virtually put Roanoke on the map only 20 years earlier when it had been only a tiny town known as Big Lick. However, {{in the spirit of}} free enterprise, the leaders of the City of Roanoke agreed to provide the needed right-of-way through the city along the north bank of the Roanoke River. This was only a short distance from N's general offices and principal shops.|$|E

500|$|In 1862, several Union gunboats had {{successfully}} passed onto the river between Vicksburg and Port Hudson, interfering with Confederate supply and troop movements. [...] In March 1863, {{after they had}} been captured or destroyed, naval commander David Farragut sought to run the river past Port Hudson {{in a bid to}} regain control over that area, and convinced Banks to make a diversionary land attack on the Confederate stronghold. Banks marched with 12,000 men from Baton Rouge on March 13, but was unable to reach the enemy position due to inaccurate maps. He then compounded the failure to engage the enemy with miscommunications with Farragut. [...] The naval commander successfully navigated two gunboats past Port Hudson, taking fire en route, without support. Banks ended up retreating back to Baton Rouge, his troops plundering <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> The episode was a further blow to Banks's reputation as a military commander, leaving many with the false impression he had not wanted to support Farragut.|$|E

At this point, [...] "To the great Surprise and Astonishment of every one in Less than half an Hour after Coming to an Anchor, the Brig & Sloop Both Gote under way without firing a Gun" [...] and [...] "made down the River against the Tide of flood."

Access to Hampton Roads frontage with enough adjoining land to build a new coal pier was crucial to the whole scheme. Undeveloped land was located at Sewells Point where the Page-Rogers interests purchased [...] of frontage on Hampton Roads, and adjoining land. To facilitate building of the new railroad, Norfolk provided a right-of-way extending virtually completely around the city to reach Sewells Point.|$|E
