Web service composition may save time and expense in software development. In this paper, we introduce the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> hierarchy in the OWL-S Ontology Framework for dynamic web service composition. In our approach, the web services are composed at the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> level which is {{a higher level of}} abstraction than concrete services. The super instance of an <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> is also introduced to help describe the service is attached with an instance pool including all instances of the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> to facilitate fail-over and dynamic compositions.

In addition, nonfunctional features such as requester and provider contexts and quality of service are considered to refine the search results according to the requester requirements...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{periodicals}} {{published in}} Japan were studied {{by analyzing the}} journals abstracted in Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICZ), the most comprehensive <b>abstracting</b> <b>service</b> for Japanese medical journal articles. Since the inauguration of medical periodicals in 1869, the number of journals has increased remarkably. In 1963 ICZ abstracted 1, 074 journals published in Japan (960 in Japanese and 114 in other languages). Of these 1, 074 titles, 855 were on medical sciences, of which 740 were substantive. A subject analysis of the substantive journals in ICZ, {{as compared to the}} 124 Japanese journals currently indexed in Index Medicus, was also made. Data were presented relating the number of periodicals {{to the size of the}} medical scene in Japan and the United States, and it was pointed out that good control of the literature, by whatever methods, requires a knowledge of the extent of the publications...|$|E

40|$|Start-up {{problems}} for a journal include attracting authors and building initial readership, but challenges {{further down the}} line include building visibility and maintaining credibility. One of the key strategies {{in this regard is}} indexing. According to the literature, the main reasons for having a journal indexed or listed in an <b>abstracting</b> <b>service</b> relate to visibility, and to quality, in terms of credibility and prestige. In this paper, I will look at each of these in more detail. For concrete examples, I will draw upon my experience with indexing an interdisciplinary journal in the social sciences, Africa Insight, of which I am currently the editor. Our experience, in a nutshell, has been that getting the journal indexed does create more visibility, and that it certainly confers some credibility – but it has had little effect on the bottom-line of subscriptions and sales...|$|E
40|$|Open access (OA) publishing, whereby authors, their institutions, {{or their}} {{granting}} bodies pay or provide a repository through which peer-reviewed work is available online for free, is championed {{as a model}} {{to increase the number}} of citations per paper and disseminate results widely, especially to researchers in developing countries. We compared the number of citations of OA and non-OA papers in six journals and four books published since 2000 to test whether OA increases number of citations overall and increases citations made by authors in developing countries. After controlling for type of paper (e. g., review or research paper), length of paper, authors' citation profiles, number of authors per paper, and whether the author or the publisher released the paper in OA, OA had no statistically significant influence on the overall number of citations per journal paper. Journal papers were cited more frequently if the authors had published highly cited papers previously, were members of large teams of authors, or published relatively long papers, but papers were not cited more frequently if they were published in an OA source. Nevertheless, author-archived OA book chapters accrued up to eight times more citations than chapters in the same book that were not available through OA, perhaps because there is no online <b>abstracting</b> <b>service</b> for book chapters. There was also little evidence that journal papers or book chapters published in OA received more citations from authors in developing countries relative to those journal papers or book chapters not published in OA. For scholarly publications in conservation biology, only book chapters had an OA citation advantage, and OA did not increase the number of citations papers or chapters received from authors in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Psychological {{treatments}} {{are designed to}} treat pain, distress and disability, and are in common practice. No comprehensive systematic review has been published since 1999. OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} psychological therapies on pain, disability, and mood. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological therapy were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE and Psychlit and CENTRAL from the beginning of each <b>abstracting</b> <b>service</b> until January 2008. A further search was undertaken from January 2008 to August 2008. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and from discussion with investigators. SELECTION CRITERIA: Full publications of RCTs of psychological treatments compared with an active treatment, waiting list or treatment as usual. Studies were excluded if the pain was primarily headache, or was associated with a malignant disease. Studies were also excluded if the number of patients in any treatment arm was less than 10. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifty-two studies were examined with a quality rating scale specifically designed for use with these studies. Data were extracted from 40 studies (4781 participants) by two authors. Two main classes of treatment (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Behaviour Therapy (BT)), were compared with two control conditions (Treatment as Usual (TAU) and Active control (AC)), at two assessment points (immediately following treatment and six months following treatment), giving eight comparisons. For each comparison, treatment effectiveness was assessed on three outcomes: pain, disability, and mood giving a total of 24 analyses. MAIN RESULTS: Overall there is an absence of evidence for BT, except for pain immediately following treatment compared with TAU. CBT has some small positive effects for pain, disability and mood. At present there is insufficient data on quality or content of treatment to investigate their influence on outcome. The quality of the trial design has improved over time but the quality of treatments has not. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: CBT and BT have weak effects in improving pain. CBT and BT have minimal effects on disability associated with chronic pain. CBT and BT are effective in altering mood outcomes, and {{there is some evidence that}} these changes are maintained at six months...|$|E
