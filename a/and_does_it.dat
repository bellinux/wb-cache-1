[...] Common Sense Media's Kate Pavao praised its relevant themes for teenagers: [...] "Readers will find themselves quickly feeling sorry for the protagonist and worrying about him throughout his transformative journey." [...] For The A.V.

500|$|Upon release, Perfect Dark {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from magazines and websites. Critics praised multiple {{aspects of the}} game, particularly its graphics, sound and value. Joe Fielder of GameSpot felt that Perfect Dark is [...] "unparalleled" [...] as a console first-person shooter, while Nintendo Power said that the game [...] is [...] "more compelling than most action movies and much deeper than any video game of its type." [...] Martin Kitts, writing for N64 Magazine, described it as [...] "dauntingly huge", stating that it [...] "takes everything that made its predecessor such an enduring favourite <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> bigger, better and more often." [...] Chi Kong Lui of GameCritics criticised the weak characters and unoriginal storyline, but nevertheless judged the [...] "extraordinary amount [...] of high-quality multiplayer modes and features", meant that [...] "the game is still a blast".|$|E

Biddle {{gave the}} episode {{one and a}} half stars and commented [...] "Carey always keeps you watching, {{although}} he's always threatening to be funnier than he is. But more than any other Friends ripoff, this show's supporting actors slow down the central character – they're set decoration. Comic scenes involving the full cast build, then trip over themselves." [...] Alan Pergament, writing for The Buffalo News, included The Drew Carey Show in his Top 10 new shows, noting [...] "Carey is a lovable goof and his male buddy show has the chance of becoming the male version of Designing Women." [...] Pergament cited the lack of prominent female characters and [...] "a reliance on too many risque-language jokes" [...] as the weaknesses of the show. The Washington Post's Tom Shales found the episode funny, adding [...] "The Drew Carey Show bucks all the prevailing sitcom trends <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> endearingly." ...|$|E

He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique {{found the}} {{production}} {{design and the}} cinematography overwhelming, but he considered the narrative engagement of Sewell's amnesiac character to be ultimately successful. Biodrowski writes, [...] "As the story progresses, {{the pieces of the}} puzzle fall into place, and we gradually realize that the film is not a murky muddle of visuals propping up a weak story. All the questions lead to answers, and the answers make sense within the fantasy framework." [...] The reviewer compared Dark City to the director's preceding film The Crow in style but found Dark City to introduce new themes and to be a [...] "more thoroughly consistent" [...] film. Biodrowski concluded, [...] "Dark City may not provide profound answers, but it deals seriously with a profound idea, <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> {{in a way that is}} cathartic and even uplifting, without being contrived or condescending. As a technical achievement, it is superb, and that technique is put in the service of telling a story that would be difficult to realize any other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the Los Angeles Times {{wrote of}} her videos, [...] "this footage {{is a major}} hoot", and BroadwayWorld.com {{described}} Ballinger as an [...] "Internet Superstar." [...] The Times of London commented that although Miranda's videos have made her [...] "a darling of the Broadway musical-theatre scene ... is not online but on stage that Miranda truly comes to ghastly life." [...] In 2010, a BroadwayWorld review of Miranda's live comedy act said that Ballinger's [...] "'Miranda Sings' persona is a very unique and original concept devised by a very creative imagination. ... Miranda {{is not to be}} missed. [...] the old saying goes, it takes talent to be that bad". Another commentator wrote similarly: [...] "It's so awful, it's brilliant." [...] Woman Around Town called Miranda [...] "an atrocious, comedic masterpiece." [...] Perez Hilton praised Miranda's parody of the hit song [...] "Chandelier" [...] as [...] "the crowning achievement of music video parodies ... utterly fantastic". TheaterJones noted that Ballinger: [...] "has hit on a character that reflects the zeitgeist of our time <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> with tongue firmly planted in cheek." [...] In 2015, Playbill concluded: [...] "Miranda Sings is a huge talent. With very demonstrative facial expressions, a unique take on makeup and wardrobe and her almost unbelievable vocal stylings, she cuts an undeniable figure in the world of online music video." [...] The Guardian characterized Miranda's channel as [...] "so bad it's great". Miranda has been compared with such absurd comic creations as Roseanne Roseannadanna and Andy Kaufman's characters, Kimmy Schmidt, [...] "a distaff Napoleon Dynamite" [...] and Pee-wee Herman.|$|E
2500|$|This sonnet is {{important}} because it is the first one that Shakespeare gives us. It sets the tone {{for the rest of the}} collection of sonnets. According to Helen Vendler, this sonnet can be “as an index to the rest of the sonnets". The main reason she says that it {{is important}} is because it brings [...] "into play such a plethora of conceptual material; it seems a self-conscious groundwork laid for the rest". Scholars like Helen Vendler think that this particular sonnet may have been composed after the others. She says that because of the [...] "sheer abundance of values, images, and concepts important in the sequence which are called into play" [...] and [...] "the number of significant words brought to our attention" [...] in this sonnet, that it [...] "may have been deliberately composed late, as a 'preface' to the others". Philip Martin says that Sonnet 1 is important to the rest because it [...] "states the themes for the sonnets immediately following and also for the sequence at large". To him, the themes are announced in this sonnet and the later ones develop those themes. Joseph Pequigney says that Sonnet 1 does serve an introductory <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> unconventionally; [...] "it might on that very account be seen as a befitting way to begin the least conventional of Renaissance love-sonnet sequences". It provides a [...] "production of metaphorical motifs that will recur in the upcoming sonnets, particularly in the next fourteen or so; it gives the concepts of beauty and time and their interrelationship, as also the emblem of the rose, all of which carry the weight in the other sonnets; and it shows the theme of reproduction, to be taken up in all except one of the sixteen ensuing poems".|$|E
