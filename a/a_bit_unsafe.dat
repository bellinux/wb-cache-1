50|$|A snaffle is not {{necessarily}} <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> with <b>a</b> jointed <b>bit</b> mouthpiece, as is often thought. <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> is <b>a</b> snaffle because it creates direct pressure without leverage on the mouth. It is <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> without <b>a</b> shank. Therefore, a single- or double-jointed mouthpiece, though the most common designs for snaffle bits, does not make <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>a</b> snaffle. Even a mullen mouth (a solid, slightly curved bar) or <b>a</b> bar <b>bit</b> is <b>a</b> snaffle.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> pelham <b>bit</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>bit</b> {{used when}} riding a horse. It has {{elements}} of both <b>a</b> curb <b>bit</b> and <b>a</b> snaffle <b>bit.</b> In this respect <b>a</b> pelham <b>bit</b> functions similar to a double bridle, and like a double bridle it normally has [...] "double" [...] reins: a set of curb reins {{and a set of}} snaffle reins. [...] Because it has <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> shank and can exert curb-style pressure on the horse, it is considered <b>a</b> curb <b>bit.</b> Like all curb <b>bits,</b> <b>a</b> pelham <b>bit</b> has <b>a</b> mouthpiece, shanks with both purchase and lever arms, a ring for rein attachment {{at the bottom of the}} shank, and a curb chain. But like <b>a</b> snaffle <b>bit,</b> <b>a</b> pelham <b>bit</b> also has <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> ring on either side of the mouthpiece. Like some curb <b>bits,</b> <b>a</b> pelham <b>bit</b> usually has [...] "loose" [...] shanks - hinged at the mouthpiece in the same way that the rings of <b>a</b> snaffle <b>bit</b> are hinged. When two sets of reins are used, the snaffle rein generally is wider, to help distinguish it from the curb. A [...] "cowboy pelham" [...] is a western style of loose-jawed curb bit with additional rings at the mouthpiece allowing a second set of reins to be added.|$|R
