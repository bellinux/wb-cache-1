A DEA is comprised of a polymer sandwiched between two compliant electrodes. When voltage is applied between the two electrodes, electrostatic attraction between the electrodes compresses the elastomer in that direction and stretches it {{in the other two}} directions. DEAs produce dimensional changes (strains) up to 300 % upon application of an electric field. DEAs have tremendous potential for applications requiring large displacements and have been demonstrated for many macro-scale (centimeter and larger) applications such as robots, loudspeakers, and motors. There are potentially many useful applications for micro-scale DEAs (less than millimeter-sized devices with micron-sized actuators) in the fields of micro-robotics, micro-optics, and micro-fluidics. However, miniaturization of DEAs is challenging because many of the materials and DEA fabrication methods used on the macro-scale cannot be adapted for micro-scale fabrication of DEAs.

This thesis explores the feasibility of developing fabrication strategies for micro-scale DEAs by adapting micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. In addition, fabrication protocols for micro-scale DEAs have been developed. The other aspect of this thesis is the design of bending DEAs. Benders are useful because for a given actuation strain, greater deflection can be observed by controlling the stiffnesses and thicknesses of different layers. A general guideline for designing bending DEA configurations such as unimorph, bimorph, and multilayer stacks was developed using a multilayer analytical model. The design optimization is based on the effect of thickness and stiffness of different layers on curvature, blocked force, and work. Complaint electrodes and their design are important for DEAs to enable the elastomer to stretch unrestricted. Thus, design criteria for the fabrication of crenellated electrodes and crenellated elastomers with electrodes were investigated. This guideline enabled design of structures with appropriate axial or bending stiffnesses based on the amplitude, angle, length, and thickness. Simple analytical equations for axial and bending stiffness for crenellated electrodes with different shapes were derived. In addition, numerical simulations of crenellated elastomer with stiff electrode were performe...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of polymer microfabrication technologies for the realization of two major components of a pneumatic tactile display: a microactuator array and a complementary microvalve (control) array. The concept, fabrication, and characterization of <b>a</b> kinematically-stabilized <b>polymeric</b> microbubble <b>actuator</b> (¡°endoskeletal microbubble actuator¡±) were presented. A systematic design and modeling procedure was carried out to generate an optimized geometry of the corrugated diaphragm to satisfy membrane deflection, force, and stability requirements set forth by the tactile display goals. A refreshable Braille cell as a tactile display prototype has been developed based on a 2 x 3 endoskeletal microbubble array and an array of commercial valves. The prototype can provide both a static display (which meets the displacement and force requirement of a Braille display) and vibratory tactile sensations. Along with the above capabilities, the device was designed to meet the criteria of lightness and compactness to permit portable operation. The design is scalable with respect to the number of tactile actuators while still being simple to fabricate. In order to further reduce the size and cost of the tactile display, a microvalve array can be integrated into the tactile display system to control the pneumatic fluid that actuates the microbubble actuator. A piezoelectrically-driven and hydraulically-amplified polymer microvalve has been designed, fabricated, and tested. An incompressible elastomer was used as a solid hydraulic medium to convert the small axial displacement of a piezoelectric actuator into a large valve head stroke while maintaining a large blocking force. The function of the microvalve as an on-off switch for a pneumatic microbubble tactile actuator was demonstrated. To further reduce the cost of the microvalve, a laterally-stacked multilayer PZT actuator has been fabricated using diced PZT multilayer, high aspect ratio SU- 8 photolithography, and molding of electrically conductive polymer composite electrodes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Magnetic field {{sensitive}} gels, called ferrogels, are chemically cross-linked polymer networks swollen by a ferrofluid. The monodomain magnetic particles, with {{a typical}} size of about 10 nm, couple {{the shape of}} the polymer gel to the nonuniform external magnetic field. Shape distortion occurs instantaneously and disappears abruptly when an external magnetic field is applied or removed, respectively. This work provides a thermodynamic analysis of shape transition based on the free energy of the swollen network that includes the elasticity of network chains as well as magnetic interactions of finely dispersed solid particles with the external field. It is shown that noncontinuous shape transition is due to a shift of equilibrium state from one local minimum to another one, similar to a first-order phase transition. The discussions presented here may be useful for the design of magnetically active soft <b>polymeric</b> <b>actuators.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Polymeric microactuators are {{potentially}} useful in micromechanical systems and lab-on-a-chip systems. However, manufacturing of miniature <b>polymeric</b> <b>actuators</b> has been complicated {{owing to the}} necessity of including electrodes for actuation or using lithographic techniques for patterning. Here, we demonstrate that all-polymer microdevices can be fabricated using inkjet printing technology in combination with self-organizing liquid-crystal network actuators. We exploit the self-assembling properties of the liquid crystal to create large strain gradients, and light-driven actuation is chosen to allow simple and remote addressing. By using multiple inks, microactuators with different subunits are created that can be selectively addressed by changing the wavelength of the light. The actuators mimic the motion of natural cilia. These artificial cilia {{have the potential to}} create flow and mixing in wet environments such as lab-on-a-chip applications.
