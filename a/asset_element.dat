40|$|The {{quantity}} of assets, especially {{the quality of}} assets, {{plays a crucial role}} in development of enterprises. For the time being, most studies about asset quality of enterprises are limited to qualitative analysis and there are rarely studies of quantitative evaluation. DEA analysis method is one which studies whether a multiple element input and multiple output system is relatively effective. We may regard an enterprise as a system with input of <b>asset</b> <b>element</b> and output of quality benefit. This article employed a quantitative method to discuss asset quality evaluation based on DEA Model by irrationally selecting <b>asset</b> <b>element</b> input indexes and quality benefit output indexes. Then, the author analyzed applicability and merits as well as disadvantages of this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{expectations}} towards {{asset management}} systems (AMS) often exceed what most AMS can or do deliver. The disappointment of stakeholders with an implemented AMS frequently {{leads to the}} abandonment of the otherwise sound principles of asset management. A review of the critical components of transport asset management systems highlighted several issues of which the treatment of uncertainties and the treatment selection method were explored in detail. Though performance forecasts based on average values may be right on the average, they are most likely wrong when looking at smaller segment levels in specific cases – i. e. most of the time. The key performance indicator for the Sydney Harbour Bridge maintenance requires that {{only a very small}} proportion of the paint is in need of immediate repair. To meet the specified maintenance objectives, a model is required that can contemplate both the extent and severity of the paint condition of each element of the Bridge. The paper discusses and describes the development of a suitable model based on Markov chains. The model has a broader application well beyond the Sydney Harbour Bridge as it is suitable for modelling condition parameters defined in terms of discrete condition states. The model relieves the users from the tyranny of the commonly used statistical parameters describing central tendencies, such as the average, thus making characterisation of an <b>asset</b> <b>element</b> more representative and thus accurate. As multiple conditions on the same element are possible, the accuracy of the budget and condition forecast also increases...|$|E

A space-based resource economy could produce, transport, and store resource at distributed locations such as the lunar surface, stable orbits, or Lagrange points to avoid Earth‟s deep gravity well.

40|$|Accounting {{assessment}} {{is a process}} with tax implications on accounting figures. In fact, {{when it comes to}} evaluation, we need to clarify exactly what is being refered to: it s about the individual assessment of an asset or liability, or about the global assessment of a business. So, in a narrower approach, in accounting we are particularly interested in the individual assessment of assets and liabilities. In the evaluation, the concept of value is the primary element, accounting, especially along with the application of the principle of economic prevalence over the juridic, managed to convey the best measure those interested, information about how to create, to mesure and how to comunicate to business partners the value.

40|$|This paper aims {{to define}} the role of Geomorphology in the {{assessment}} of the impact of human activities on the environment. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) should be carried out for specific projects, in order to evaluate their suitability for the quality of the environment. In fact, each planned activity may have an impact on various environmental components. Among these, the natural component must be examined in terms of geomorphological hazards, which may endanger a project, and of geomorphological <b>assets</b> (<b>elements</b> forming the educational and cultural heritage of the landscape), which may be damaged to various extents by human activities. The relationships between humans and environment are taken into account, with particular attention to the effects of a project on the geomorphological environment. From a geomorphological point of view, after having assessed the suitability of a certain location, mainly with respect to its morphography and morphometry, the geomorphological hazards of the area which may threaten the project (risk) must be considered; then the geomorphological assets, which may be damaged by the same project (direct impact) have to be individuated. Human activities may produce two other kinds of effect: the first refers to the consequences of the geomorphological hazards induced by a project on the project itself (direct risk) and on the surronding areas (indirect risk); the second takes into account the potential deterioration of a geomorphological asset due to hazards induced by the project (indirect impact). Examples of these different cases are presented...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To {{investigate}} the evolutionary {{process of the}} retail logistics network formation, and to propose a relationship framework between the logistics asset buyer (the retailer) and the logistics asset supplier (the third-party logistics firm). Design/methodology/approach – The evolutionary process {{is based on the}} way the <b>asset</b> specificity <b>element</b> of transaction costs theory can be perceived by the logistics asset buyer and the logistics asset supplier. The <b>asset</b> specificity <b>element</b> is linked to both network and buyer-supplier relationship theories with the aim of conceptualising a buyer-supplier relationship framework. Secondary data for the UK food retail chain are also employed. Findings – A new relationship framework is developed based on the buyers’-suppliers’ perceptions in relation to logistics asset specificity, and the conditions required for the formation of the retail logistics network are illustrated. If transaction costs are perceived as high by both the buyer and the supplier of a logistics asset, the retailer will engage into a fourth-party logistics network formation where the use of information technology systems is of critical importance. At this stage, these systems will become the primary co-ordination device for the reduction and absorption of complexity in the retail chain. Originality/value – The paper offers a unique buyer-supplier partnership framework by proposing that the formation of a fourth-party logistics network will decrease the complexity of modern retail logistics operations. The paper will assist retail managers responsible for the development of logistics strategies and will be beneficial to researchers examining logistics and supply chain management operations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{critically}} revise the well-established attitude towards economic theorizing of property as a complete bundle of rights over well-defined uses. While some authors have previously introduced the incomplete dimension of property in their discourse, they have conceptualized incompleteness either in terms of undiscovered uses, weakly enforced rights or weakly partitioned rights. We move from a different idea of incompleteness, namely the initial lack of attribution of well-defined rights over new undefined uses of an asset. We suggest a possible direction of future research towards a theory of incomplete property, namely a theory of property intended as an incomplete bundle of defined and undefined rights over the uses of an <b>asset.</b> The <b>elements</b> of the theory here delineated may contribute to reconcile and to integrate under a common framework some of the main debated issues on the nature and the dynamics of property rights.

We find that ownership of jewelry and low value livestock, such as chickens and other poultry, are the assets most strongly associated with women’s participation in paid work. However, the strength of women’s rights over the assets they own also matters.

40|$|The {{culture of}} reglating {{behavior}} {{in the defense of}} human life is as ancient as social interaction itself. Both are necessarily mutually related in order to achieve coexistence, security, and justice, according to the covenants established in each society. In the modern State, the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Citizen led to institutionalizing public force to achieve these objectives. In the western world, this operates from the principle of “monopoly of legitimate physical violence” postulated by Weber. This is the political device for the distribution and conservation of power. However, the great transformation, “during {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, involving the global economic markets and the system of nation states through daily life and the psychological dynamic of families and individuals,” according to David Garland (2005, p. 141) generated a shift in the matters handled by the State, including people’s security, tranquility, care for their <b>assets,</b> and <b>elements</b> in the environment that make life possible. In Colombia, the force of law and order predominantly focuses its attention on high-impact crime, and very little on citizen conflicts affecting coexistence. Meanwhile, private surveillance and security have skyrocketed in caring for the integrity and assets of private citizens, through mechanisms and means such as firearms, which had formerly been for the exclusive use of the members of forces of law and order.

This paper empirically evaluates one of the explana-tions for this puzzle that rests on the simultaneous presence of uninsur-able labor income risk and limited accessibility of TDA <b>assets.</b> Together, these <b>elements</b> lead some borrowing-constrained households to forgo tax efficiency in favor of allocations that provide more liquidity in bad income states—an outcome labeled as precautionary portfolio choice. The analysis of household-level portfolio data from the Survey of Consumer Finances suggests that both the choice of whether to hold a tax-efficient portfolio {{and the degree of}} portfolio tax inefficiency are related to the presence and severity of precautionary motives. 1. ...|$|R

Because municipal water-supply systems, frequently publicly owned and operated, face little capital-market competition and generally cannot go bankrupt, they lack incentives to operate efficiently. Private systems also face operational and management problems as a result of rate-of-return regulation and unequal tax treatment with publicly owned systems. Rate regulation removes incentives to innovate and adopt least-cost practices.

40|$|For {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the twentieth century, trusts served two pivotal roles. The first was as a vehicle to help mitigate federal and state estate tax burdens, the rates of which could be quite significant. The second was to assist in asset preservation, safeguarding trust beneficiaries from their profligacy, former spouses, creditors, and the like. At the start of the twenty-first century, Congress passed legislation that curtailed the impact of the federal estate tax, and many state legislatures have followed suit, either eliminating or significantly reducing their estate taxes. As a result of these legislative changes, trust instrument reliance to mitigate transfer tax burdens is no longer a commonplace objective. Instead, the role of trusts has shifted entirely toward asset preservation, buoyed by state legislative reforms that facilitate fulfillment of this role. However, state legislative reform measures that are designed to strengthen the <b>asset</b> preservation <b>element</b> of trusts are replete with problems. In particular, they drain government coffers as they pit states against one another and the federal government; furthermore, insofar as they promote an aristocracy-like environment (where wealth cascades down from one generation to the next), they thwart economic mobility, an essential component of our nation 2 ̆ 7 s financial fabric. Using three specific examples of states 2 ̆ 7 aggressive efforts to attract trust formation within their borders, this analysis demonstrates the shortcomings associated with the evolving role of trusts in asset preservation and its corrosive effects.
