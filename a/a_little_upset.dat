25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had children. When they asked homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent said yes. Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>upset,</b> if one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay men were more likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between older and younger gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>upset.</b> Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E

On July 30, 2012, Hamilton released a collaboration mixtape entitled Cinematic Hallucinations: The Bully And The Pet with rapper S.K.E. The Heistman. On August 17, 2012 during an interview Hamilton talked about his change in his music stating [...] "When I was incarcerated, my songs got a little more aggressive, but after I did some time and came back to NYC, I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>upset</b> at my fans because they were saying some pretty harsh things about me when I was locked up. This is not how you should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte said it best it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E

5000|$|The episode [...] "Vatos" [...] {{marked the}} last regular {{appearance}} of Emma Bell as Amy, whose character was killed {{off in the}} conclusion of the installment.
