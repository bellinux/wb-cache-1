5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than adults to their predators.|$|E

30|$|The bridge <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to the {{far-field}} accelerograms, {{which means}} that the mentioned bridge <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to seismic effects due to far-field earthquakes than near faults. This outcome is consistent with the response of the bridge observed in the earthquakes in far-field. It seems that the bridge location in relation of the epicenter does not impact importantly the fragility curves.|$|R
5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
30|$|Livestock {{in general}} <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to {{predation}} when {{released into the}} forests without accompanying herders, especially during farming seasons. Cattle, particularly the indigenous breeds, <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> among different livestock types. Proper livestock herding with accompanying livestock herders could minimize predation losses. We recommend development of a comprehensive livestock management policy that will ensure minimal livestock losses to wild predators.|$|R

5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than others. The most {{prominent}} early effects {{are in a}} part of the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|Survival horror {{games are}} a subgenre of horror games, where the player {{is unable to}} fully prepare or arm their avatar. The player usually {{encounters}} several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option, such as {{a limited number of}} weapons or invulnerable enemies, if weapons are available, their ammunition is sparser than in other games, and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare, if even available at all. Thus, players <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than in action games, and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where the odds are weighed decisively against the avatar. This gameplay shifts away from direct combat, and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them. Games try to enhance the experience of vulnerability by making the game single player rather than multiplayer, and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E

25|$|It {{refers to}} the {{intrinsic}} (or natural) vulnerability of a groundwater system to pollution. Intrinsically, some aquifers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to pollution than other aquifers. Shallow unconfined aquifers are more at risk of pollution because there are fewer layers to filter out contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{discovered}} that memory enhancements for emotional information tend to be greater after longer delays than after relatively short ones. This delayed effect {{is consistent with the}} proposal that emotionally arousing memories {{are more likely to be}} converted into a relatively permanent trace, whereas memories for nonarousing events <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to disruption.|$|E

25|$|Modern cutting {{technology}} {{has allowed the}} development of increasingly complex and hitherto unthinkable shapes, such as stars and butterflies. Their proportions are mostly {{a matter of personal}} preference; however, due to their sharp terminations and diamond's relative fragility, these cuts <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to accidental breakage and may therefore be more difficult to insure.|$|E
25|$|Masonry saucer domes, {{because they}} exist entirely in compression, {{can be built}} much thinner than other dome shapes without {{becoming}} unstable. The trade-off between the proportionately increased horizontal thrust at their abutments and their decreased weight and quantity of materials may make them more economical, but they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to damage from movement in their supports.|$|E
25|$|Under SGT the E>A>C>D voters {{effectively}} {{determine the}} winners of the two final seats. Under WIGT {{as a result of the}} E>A>C>D votes failing to contribute to the election of candidate A and transferring at an increased value, C wins a seat as opposed to D. SGT systems <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to this form of tactical voting than WIGT systems.|$|E
40|$|We provide exact {{relations}} {{giving the}} probability of individual and coalitional manipulation of three specific social choice functions (Borda rule, Copeland rule, Plurality rule) in three-alternative elections when the notion of self-selectivity is imposed. The {{results suggest that the}} Borda rule <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to coalitional manipulation than the Copeland rule and the Plurality rule. However, Plurality rule seems to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to individual manipulability when the number of voters is greater than a certain threshold value. In addition, {{the probability of}} individual and coalitional manipulation tends to vanish significantly when the notion of selfselectivity is imposed...|$|R

25|$|When {{schooling}} fish stop to feed, {{they break}} ranks and become shoals. Shoals <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to predator attack. The shape a shoal or school takes {{depends on the}} type of fish and what the fish are doing. Schools that are travelling can form long thin lines, or squares or ovals or amoeboid shapes. Fast moving schools usually form a wedge shape, while shoals that are feeding tend to become circular.|$|E
25|$|As {{underweight}} children <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> {{to almost}} all infectious diseases, the indirect disease burden of malnutrition {{is estimated to}} be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the direct effects of malnutrition. The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.|$|E
25|$|Research into moose {{predation}} {{suggests that}} {{their response to}} perceived threats is learned rather than instinctual. In practical terms this means moose <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> in areas where wolf or bear populations were decimated {{in the past but}} are now rebounding. These same studies suggest, however, that moose learn quickly and adapt, fleeing an area if they hear or smell wolves, bears, or scavenger birds such as ravens.|$|E
