5|$|The Steam overlay {{shows the}} player's friends on both Steam and the PlayStation Network, with {{achievements}} rewarded for both Steam and PlayStation Network Trophies. Players can unlock {{the game on}} Steam for Windows and OS X for no additional charge. The integration of Steamworks on the PlayStation 3 allows Valve to collect data <b>about</b> <b>problems</b> that arise after shipping and push appropriate updates. Valve has stated they do not plan on integrating other PlayStation 3 features, such as 3D television or PlayStation Move support. In June 2012, Valve announced that the PlayStation 3 version would be patched later that year to include support for the PlayStation Move motion controller, and to add the additional content that was previously provided with the Hydra, under the name Portal 2 In Motion. The patch was released in early November 2012. A free co-op add-on for the Portal 2 In Motion content was added in June 2013. Valve said that despite additional support for PlayStation 3 over Xbox 360, the core game is the same on both platforms.|$|E
5|$|The first udema Gamla was c. 30m (100ft) {{long and}} with a draft of 1.5m (5ft). The later udemas,Torborg and Ingeborg, carried a mizzen mast, and were both longer and wider, 37m (121ft) long and almost 9m (29ft) wide with a draft of just over 3m (10ft). Torborg, built in 1772, had three {{additional}} 12-pounders, eleven in the centerline and two in the bow facing forwards, housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports, but with the rowing seats left undecked. This arrangement proved to be less successful with reports <b>about</b> <b>problems</b> with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke. She was also a poor sailer and slow under oars, earning the udema a poor reputation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the relationship between the disposition of critical thinking and the perception <b>about</b> <b>problem</b> solving skills of the students. In descriptive studies correlational model was used. Disposition of critical thinking points data was collected in this study by using the “The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory” developed by Facione, Facione and Giancarlo(1988) and the perceptions <b>about</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving Skills data was collected by using the problem solving skills inventory adapted into Turkish by Sahin, Sahin and Heppner(1993). Based on the findings of the study, it was revealed that there was a moderate, positive and significant relationship between pre-service music teachers’ disposition of critical thinking and perceptions <b>about</b> <b>problem</b> solving...|$|R

5|$|After {{the divorce}} was finalized, Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from Oak Park, Illinois, who was 23years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a former Lieutenant Governor of Missouri. Both Virginia's parents and Boyce's son Ben opposed the relationship. In May 1910, after the planned {{marriage}} was announced, an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce sustained a facial wound. Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs. Two days later, Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon. Almost immediately, there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers <b>about</b> <b>problems</b> within the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a daughter, whom they named Virginia. A few months later, in December 1911, Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter. After Boyce's wife filed for divorce in March 1912, she moved to Santa Barbara, California, with their daughter and her parents. Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $100,000 settlement. Years later, the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts, a New York banker, and moved with her and Boyce's daughter to Greenwich, Connecticut. The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts. She did not meet her natural father, Boyce, until she was eight years old.|$|E

A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions <b>about</b> <b>problems</b> with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E
5|$|When Cord wakes up, {{he finds}} Chi who was {{instructed}} to kill him, but she decides to free him after a conversation. Cord and Chi head for the quayside at level 1 and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter. After they free Alexandria, they fly away as the base is destroyed. After they spot Nagarov's nuclear submarine, they land on it. Cord and Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched. They {{take care of the}} guards, and hear messages <b>about</b> <b>problems</b> with the reactor. After they split up, Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level. Lukyan later ambushes Cord, but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine. In the bridge room, Nagarov enters armed with a gun, and after their conversation, Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder. Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch. After releasing Chi, a message is heard {{that there is only one}} minute left to a critical reactor failure. They return to the deck and are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes. In the end sequence, Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets. The game ends showing Cord, Chi, and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets.|$|E

40|$|We {{automatically}} generate mutation operators for Genetic Algorithms (GA) and tune them {{to problem}} instances {{drawn from a}} given problem class.

We use Register Machines to explore a constrained design space for mutation operators. We show how two commonly used mutation operators (viz. one-point and uniform mutation) can be expressed in this framework. Iterated local search is used to search the space of mutation operators, and on a test-bed of 7 problem classes we identify machine-designed mutation operators which outperform their human counter-parts...|$|R
