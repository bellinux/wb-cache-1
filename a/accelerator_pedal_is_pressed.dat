5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{carbureted}} engines, such as single cylinder Briggs & Stratton lawn-mower engines, feature a single small throttle plate over a basic carburetor {{with a single}} venturi. The throttle is either open or closed (although {{there is always a}} small hole or other bypass to allow a small amount of air to flow through so the engine can idle when the throttle is closed), or some intermediate position. Since air velocity is crucial to the functioning of a carburetor, to keep average air velocity up, larger engines require more complex carburetors with multiple small venturis, typically two or four (these venturis are commonly called [...] "barrels). A typical [...] "2-barrel" [...] carburetor uses a single oval or rectangular throttle plate, and works similarly to a single venturi carburetor, but with two small openings instead of one. A 4-venturi carburetor has two pairs of venturis, each pair regulated by a single oval or rectangular throttle plate. Under normal operation, only one throttle plate (the [...] "primary") opens when the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> <b>pressed,</b> allowing more air into the engine, but keeping overall airflow velocity through the carburetor high (thus improving efficiency). The [...] "secondary" [...] throttle is operated either mechanically when the primary plate is opened past a certain amount, or via engine vacuum, influenced by the position of the accelerator pedal and engine load, allowing for greater air flow into the engine at high RPM and load and better efficiency at low RPM's. Multiple 2-venturi or 4-venturi carburetors can be used simultaneously in situations where maximum engine power is of priority.|$|E
40|$|Torsional {{resonances}} in {{the vehicle}} powertrain are undesired phenomena in automotive vehicles, since they cause longitudinal oscillations {{in the vehicle}}, which affect the driveability {{in a negative way}} and cause mechanical wear. It is the damping of these torsional resonances that has been the goal for this research work. The thesis has an experimental focus on powertrain control, modelling and verification. A two-inertia model of a heavy duty vehicle powertrain has been implemented in Matlab/Simulink and has been verified experimentally. Different model based linear controllers have been developed and validated both through simulations and experiments in a heavy duty vehicle. The aim with the controllers is to damp out the oscillations that occur in the powertrain during a tip-in and a tip-out (when the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> and released). The controllers use the engine as an actuator to work in anti-phase with the powertrain oscillations. The focus has been to develop a control system that takes the engine limitations like e. g. ~the smoke limiter into consideration. To keep the control signal below the maximum available engine torque, a reference governor has been introduced in the control system. Another requirement on the control system has been to keep good response of the vehicle during the control. Simulations show {{that it is possible to}} achieve a damped powertrain with a control signal that works within the limits of the engine and that gives good response of the vehicle. Also the experimental results show that the control system has a damping effect on the powertrain and that it is possible to achieve this result without loosing any response. This gives an indication that the suggested control method might be a feasible approach to reduce powertrain oscillations in a vehicle. More work is however needed to commercialize this idea. For example, the impact of backlash and model variations must be investigated and taken care of in a final control system...|$|E
5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, {{in which the}} brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> <b>are</b> <b>pressed</b> simultaneously. Classically, the brake <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> with the ball of the right foot and the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the right heel, while the clutch <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> by the left foot. However, variants are possible, with the brake and accelerator pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R

50|$|A {{substantial}} number of British buses built between about 1935 and 1960 had preselector transmission, particularly those built by Daimler and AEC, and some by Leyland. Some were mechanical, whereas the AEC RT type, universal in London at this period, had the gearbox air-operated (compressed air was also used for the brakes, windscreen wipers, etc.), which gave off a characteristic hiss when the change gear <b>pedal</b> <b>was</b> <b>pressed.</b> Typical operation of London buses was {{they had a very}} low first gear, only used on hills, so the driver when starting would select second gear, depress and release the change gear pedal to engage the transmission, and then select third ready for changing gear on the move, all this done while the bus was still stationary. On starting, just the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>was</b> <b>pressed,</b> the gear change to third made at about 15 mph by just pressing the left pedal, and that could well suffice to the next stop where the bus would be stopped in gear and the process repeated.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce the lateral {{dynamics}} shock caused by mechanical gap of a dual-motor-independently-drive electric vehicle while the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>was</b> quickly <b>pressed</b> down, the Kalman filter was adopted to design a dynamics smoothness controller. Simulation results proved the effectiveness of the control strategy - it could improve the smoothness of the lateral dynamics effectively. The effect on the control performance of the value of process noise - Q was discussed. It is important to select an appropriate Q to balance the improvement of dynamics smoothness and the increased response time for the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal...</b>|$|R
50|$|The name {{stems from}} pre-WW2 {{vehicles}} where the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>was</b> in the centre (between the clutch {{on the left}} and the foot brake to the right). The brake was able to be operated with the heel whilst the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> could <b>be</b> simultaneously <b>pressed</b> with the toe. The technique is carried out in modern cars by operating the brake with the toe area, while rocking the foot across to the right to operate the throttle with {{the right side of the}} foot. With practice, it becomes possible to smoothly and independently operate both pedals with one foot. The technique is common in all forms of motorsports.|$|R
2500|$|Under [...] "normal", {{progressive}} and linear acceleration and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, {{and the same}} sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds {{in one of the}} higher gears with a light throttle opening, and the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> then <b>pressed</b> down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> opening, and <b>is</b> completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual operation mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|R
50|$|While the Sonett V4 was {{assembled}} in Sweden, {{nearly the entire}} production was exported to the United States, with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of between US$3,200 and US$3,800 (US$ to US$ in today's dollars). In addition to its unusual fiberglass body, the Sonett V4 featured advanced safety features for its day, including a roll bar, three-point seat belts, and high-back bucket seats to protect against whiplash injury. Sonett V4s also sported a few oddities compared to standard American sports cars like e.g. Corvette, such as front wheel drive; a freewheeling clutch that disengaged automatically whenever the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>was</b> no longer <b>pressed,</b> and a column-mounted shifter, rather than a typical floor-mounted shifter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{figures for}} the revised turbo engine for the FG XR6 Turbo mimic the old FPV turbo I6, {{but this is an}} {{incorrect}} assumption and the motors are not the same. Firstly, it has a redesigned low-profile intake plenum, as opposed to the circa 1994 broadband manifold intake which originated in the naturally aspirated EF Falcon. The engine employs a new turbocharger and intercooler in conjunction with the Barra 195s hardware and software updates. The result is that the FG XR6 Turbo is actually faster than both FPV's BF Typhoon and the FG XR8. The FG XR6 Turbo uses a smaller turbo than the BA/BF XR6 Turbo so it can spool faster, make more usable power, and make less noise than the larger turbo. This engine also features a 53 Nm overboost feature. The feature can engage depending on the driving style, and when the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> fully <b>pressed</b> to the floor, it can call the computer to overboost and add an additional 53 Nm on top of the 533 Nm, making it a total of 586 Nm of torque for a maximum of 10 seconds. However, depending on the ambient temperature and conditions, this figure is significantly higher than 586Nm. Some sources claim over 640Nm is achieved for 10 seconds. Ford also under-quoted Barra 270T FG's power figures, Ford Engineers claim that the actual power output is close to or over 305kw. Numerous dynamometer printouts from various standard XR6s with the Turbo engine, as well as standard high 12 second passes at drag racing events from various owners Australia wide, help to back up Ford Engineers' claims.|$|R

5000|$|Brake Assist detects {{circumstances}} in which emergency braking is required by measuring {{the speed with which}} the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> depressed. Some systems additionally take into account the rapidity of which the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> released, pre-tensioning the brakes when a [...] "panic release" [...] of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> noted. When panic braking is detected, the Brake Assist system automatically develops maximum brake boost in order to mitigate a driver's tendency to brake without enough force. In doing so, Brake Assist has been shown to reduce stopping distance by a significant margin (up to 20% in some studies).|$|R

50|$|To restart, {{the driver}} simply takes his {{foot off the}} brake and presses the accelerator. In ECO mode, the clutch was {{disengaged}} when the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>was</b> released for maximum economy, so the car freewheels as much as possible, with the clutch re-engaging {{as soon as the}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> or brake <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> touched.

3000|$|The {{real-time}} {{data from the}} dSPACE-DS 1103 can be saved and monitored in Matlab/Simulink environment as illustrated in Fig. 3. Figure  9 shows the first test results when the vehicle runs straight. Normally, <b>accelerator</b> and brake <b>pedal</b> <b>are</b> {{not allowed to be}} pushed at the same time. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 a for <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position and Fig. 9 b for brake pedal position. When the accelerator is pushed, longitudinal velocity increases and so as acceleration. The deeper position of the pedal, the higher velocity and acceleration. Considering the time interval (0 – 20 s), the Fig. 9 can be interpreted as follows. When the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> pushed in the first 14 s, the car is sped up with the acceleration of about 2.5  m/s^ 2 (Fig. 9 c) maximum, as the car reaches the velocity of 24  m/s^ 2  (Fig. 9 d).

50|$|Additionally, traffic {{regulations}} {{in a large}} number of countries require trucks to always drive with an engaged gear, which in turn provides a certain amount of engine braking (viscous losses to the engine oil and air pumped through the engine and friction losses to the cylinder walls and bearings) when no <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>is</b> applied.|$|R

5000|$|The {{advent of}} concern about fuel economy and {{emissions}} had major impacts on engine design. Some of the trade-offs reduced throttle response.
