5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him {{for the murder of}} billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, British {{obstetrician}} Dr. James Blundell made efforts to treat hemorrhage by transfusion of human blood using a syringe. In 1818 following experiments with animals, he performed {{the first successful}} transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient's husband <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>donor,</b> and extracted four ounces of blood from his arm to transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the transfusion of blood. He made {{a substantial amount of}} money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).|$|E

500|$|Because {{of these}} traditions, kings {{have had an}} {{important}} role in maintaining the Sangha, and publicly performed grand acts of merit, as is testified by epigraphic evidence from South and South-East Asia. In Sri Lanka, from the tenth century CE onward, kings have assumed the role of a lay protector of the Sangha, and so have Thai kings, during the periods of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya (fourteenth until eighteenth centuries). In fact, a number of kings in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma have described themselves as Bodhisattas, and epithets and royal language were established accordingly. In short, kingship in traditional Buddhist societies was connected with the Sangha as a field of merit: the king assumed an exemplary role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> to the Sangha, and the Sangha legitimated the king as a leader of the state. Both facilitated one another, and both needed each other. In times of famine or other hardship, it was traditionally believed that the king was failing, and the king would typically perform meritorious activities on a grand scale. In this way the king would be able to improve the kingdom's conditions, through his [...] "overflow karma" [...] (Walters). A similar role was played by queens.|$|E

Shin possessed a unique genetic makeup {{that allowed him to}} assimilate any form of tissue and organ without any chance of rejection, serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> of the Sharingan arm that Danzo Shimura possessed. Eventually, setting up base in Kaguya's dimension, Shin left with his younger clone [...] "sons" [...] with a resolution to eliminate Sasuke Uchiha for [...] "tarnishing" [...] the Uchiha name. Shin also believes that the world can only evolve through conflict and that the lasting peace created {{after the end of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War is a stagnation that he needs to destroy by reviving the Akatsuki. When Shin formally introduces himself, using one of this clone sons as a human shield, he targets Sarada to attack Sasuke before being wounded by Sakura. Shin is forced to retreat with Sakura as his captive, murdering his burnt clone to have the kunoichi transplant the child's organs into him. However, when Naruto and Sasuke come to save their teammate with Taka, Sarada, and Chocho, Shin finds himself betrayed by his clones and is killed. In the end, after a majority of them were decimated, Naruto decided to have Shin's clones entrusted to Kabuto at the orphanage, where each of them were given their own names and allowed to learn and develop their own desires separate from their 'father'. He is voiced by Nobuyuki Hiyama in the Japanese anime.|$|E
