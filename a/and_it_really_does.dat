"It is a {{long time}} since I {{received}} your dearest, kindest of letters, and if I did not answer it sooner, it was not from want of gratitude, but attendance on my poor dear mother and assistance to our landlady occupies me at every minute that I can spare from giving music lessons to some private families, and an evening class. I am very thankful to be able to earn something, so as to take off something of the burthen on my dear brother's shoulders. For, alas! the care and support of my mother and me weigh very heavily upon him. The proprietor of the Lacustrian has parted with his other clerk, and my brother has the entire business of not only writing, extracting for, and editing the paper, but of correcting the press, and he dares not remonstrate or demand better payment, as we live from week to week, and he could not afford to be dismissed. He is at the office all day, beginning at six in the morning to meet the central intelligence, he only rushes home for his meals, and goes back to work till twelve or one o'clock at night. Even then he cannot sleep. I hear him tossing about with the pain in his back that sitting at his desk brings on, and his hands are so tired by writing, and with the heat, which has been dreadful for the last few weeks, and has taken away all the appetite he ever had. You would be shocked to see him, he is so thin and altered; I cannot think how he is to continue this, but he will not hear of my writing to Lady Travis Underwood. He is never angry, except when I try to persuade him, and you never saw anything like his patience and gentleness to my poor mother. She never did either, she cannot understand it at all. At first she thought he wanted to coax the confession out of her, and when she found that it made no difference, she could not recover from her wonder--he, whom she had deserted in his babyhood, and so cruelly injured in his manhood, to devote himself to toiling for her sake, and never to speak harshly to her for one moment. She knew I loved her, and she had always been good to me, except when O'Leary forced her to be otherwise, but his behaviour has done more to touch her heart than anything, and I am sure she is, as Pere Duchamps says, a sincere penitent. She is revived by the summer heat, and can sit under the stoop and enjoy the sweet air of the lake; but she is very weak, and coughs dreadfully in the morning, just when it is cooler, and my brother might get some sleep. She tries to be good and patient with us both, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> soothe her when my brother can sit by her, and talk in his cheerful droll way; but he can stay but a very short time. He has to rush back to his horrid stuffy office, and then she frets after him and says, 'But what right have I to such a son?' and she begins to cry and cough." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{review by}} China stated [...] "It's {{a bit of}} a mixed bag to say the least.

Glenn's voice sounds more {{delicate}} than in the 80s <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> interplay beautifully with the fx. The lyrics are typical H17 political comment, smack up to date and very good with it. However, in spite of a very convincing start the chorus is a real downer, very weak indeed. A synthpop chorus by numbers with none of the reassurance of their old hits. Imagine the chorus to Temptation with all the oomph taken out. Thats why it got the 'dated' comment in Melody Maker I reckon. Not having heard the album I hesitate to say this, but maybe they've more work to do on the new sound." ...|$|E

We {{are interested in the}} result of performing integration over connections in the path integral. To find this function, we compute its moments, i. e. integrals with powers of that variable.

PACS numbers: 04. 60. -m Quantum gravityStrict definition of the functional integral is possible for Gaussian case; for small deviations from this case it is considered to be definable perturbatively. For general relativity system perturbative expansion is poorly defined due to nonrenormalizability of gravity, and we have non-Gaussian path integral. The action is essentially nonlinear, but in the Cartan-Weyl form, in terms of tetrad and connections, the action can be viewed as linear in some field variable which is bilinear in the tetrad. Suppose we have performed integration over connections and are interested in the dependence of the result on the tetrad bilinears. Of course, different bilinears are not independent, but nothing prevent us from studying analytical properties on the extended region of varying these bilinears as if these were independent variables. Since we do not possess exact definition of non-Gaussian functional integral, we need its finite dimensional realization on minisuperspace gravity system, or Regge calculus [1].
