40|$|Practices of Proximity pays {{attention}} to the central issue of wide-spread discursive representations of the English language and writing as colonial properties. To this end, it offers a study of appropriation which may be fruitful in testing pre-conceived representations of the English language, opening up endless possibilities on the roles the “users of the English language can play, and – attitudinally – above all, how others view {{the importance of this}} use” (Kachru 1990, 4). Insisting on the complex, ultimately open-ended and multilateral ownership of languages and writing by all who inhabit and use them, Practices of Proximity investigates the appropriation of the English language taking place in the Australian literary contact zone between the official ‘white’ Australia – the <b>apparent</b> <b>owners</b> of both the land and the English language – and Indigenous Australian peoples...|$|R

50|$|There {{must be some}} act or some knowing {{omission}} on {{the part}} of the principal - if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the presence of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering <b>apparent</b> authority. Business <b>owners</b> can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the termination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority.|$|R

50|$|Informal {{de facto}} {{freezing}} {{may also be}} undertaken in most common law jurisdictions by a third-party guardian or assetholder, {{where he has been}} informed that those assets are imposed with a constructive trust in favour of someone other than the <b>apparent</b> <b>owner.</b> The freeze may be effected by issuing a letter to the asset holder or guardian in question, informing them of the true origin or beneficial ownership of the targeted funds or assets, and advising them of their potential accessory civil and possible criminal liability in the event of any transfer or disposal of the assets in question. Such devices may be employed in cases where a victim of fraud suspects that targeted funds or assets may be transferred to another location where it might be impractical to gain access to them. However, the use of this technique within the United States is not generally accepted.|$|E
50|$|The foursome flees, and a mystically-empowered St. Germaine pursues Susan and Cammy—believing that Susan has the amulet. Johnny {{actually}} has the amulet, {{but when he}} and Parrish prepare to aid the teenage girls, they are confronted by Zarathos, the demonic Spirit of Vengeance and <b>apparent</b> <b>owner</b> of the Amulet of Z. Johnny agrees to bond with Zarathos in order to rescue Susan and Cammy, but Parrish grabs the amulet at the last possible moment during the bonding ritual. Consequently, Parrish and Zarathos are transformed into the Ghost Rider. Just as the now-monstrous St. Germaine {{on the verge of}} killing Susan and Cammy, the motorcycle-riding Ghost Rider intervenes. Realizing that the monster is particularly vulnerable to water, the Ghost Rider collapses a water tower, drowning him and thwarting Dracula's plan. In the aftermath of the battle, Ghost Rider attempts to flee the scene, but Johnny grabs the amulet from him—separating Parrish from Zarathos. As a result, Zarathos, the amulet and the motorcycle all disappear.|$|E
50|$|A wreck is {{categorized}} as property belonging to no <b>apparent</b> <b>owner,</b> that either sinks to the seabed, or floats {{on the surface}} of the water, whether it be intentionally cast overboard, or as the result of an accident. The term encompasses the hull of the vessel and its fixtures, as well as any other form of object on board, such as cargo and stores, and personal effects of the crew and passengers. This also encompasses the narrower definition of salvage, that is, property that has been recovered from a wreckage, or the recovery of the ship itself. There are a number of factors that contribute to the formation of a shipwreck, that can be divided into physical and cultural processes. A site can be affected by physical processes, that is, naturally occurring processes, such as the corrosion caused by salinity and ocean currents, or the growth of native and foreign marine organisms. It can also be affected by cultural processes, that is, by human interactions, such as adding or removing materials from the site of the wreck. Any archaeological activity, such as excavation, may also be considered invasive and tampering.|$|E
40|$|Provisions allow {{firms to}} defer the funds in {{times when they}} reach {{positive}} results, for the periods, in which they assume higher costs or for less economically successful periods. Similarly to allowances they are accounting items, which do not overestimate assets and revenues, and vice versa underestimate the costs and liabilities. It requires taking of all risks of loss that are known {{at the time of}} compiling of the financial statements into accounting. Reserves represent accruals in a broader sense, as they assign to the revenues generated today associated costs in order to record these revenues again in the future with the aim to eliminate the costs actually incurred. This is the way how enterprises can preclude the risks of financial distress that could arise from lack of resources needed to cover future expenses and they help to strengthen the material substance, since the creation of reserves reduces the possible distribution of the <b>apparent</b> profits to <b>owners.</b> Procedures for the creation and using of reserves are governed by Czech accounting legislation, which allows enterprises a broader application {{in the form of a}} general requirement of establishing reserves for risk and loss, while banks cannot create reserves for general banking risks and other unforeseeable risks. Differences are also among Czech and international rules on creation of reserves. In addition, there are different procedures in terms of fiscal (tax) reserves. The aim of this contribution is therefore to analyze methods of the crea­tion and using of reserves from accounting and tax perspective, especially in terms of their eligibility and entitlement and to propose modifications to enable the unification of the theoretical approaches...|$|R
40|$|The recent house price cycle has {{highlighted}} {{concerns about}} housing affordability. But is the recent deterioration in housing affordability a short-term problem, {{or is it}} a continuation of long-term trends? The Productivity Commission notes that the recent deterioration in housing affordability reflects cyclical price pressures, and these will eventually be reversed (Productivity Commission 2004 : xii). In other words, fluctuations in house prices (and rents) are inherent features of the housing market; once prices (and rents) stabilise, housing will become more affordable as incomes catch up. We aim to address this issue by comparing housing affordability and tenure share trends from 1981 to 2001. Specifically, we look at households by income quintiles and age group in Victoria. We find that housing affordability has deteriorated, particularly for those in the lowest two income quintiles. Most importantly, deterioration is not restricted to one inter Census period. It is a trend that is evident through every inter Census period from 1981 to 2001. Furthermore, we find that among younger households, those under 35 years of age, the share of home purchasers and outright owners is in long-run decline. This is particularly <b>apparent</b> amongst home <b>owners</b> in the two lowest income quintiles. These patterns could reflect delay in making the transition into homeownership rather than the thwarting of homeownership aspirations over the life course. Even if it is a delay, there is a policy concern, because more people are approaching pensionable age with high levels of mortgage debt. Our findings indicate a long-run trend deterioration in housing affordability. We expect the situation to have worsened as interest rates have risen since 2001, and house prices continued to increase into 2003...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Former {{industrial}} {{or commercial}} sites that have been left unused are typically referred to as brownfield sites, or simply, brownfields. Many communities have such properties that are abandoned, idle or underused. Despite public efforts to facilitate brownfields revitalization projects, the rate of remediation remains unexpectedly slow. Efforts to resolve this nationwide problem have included legislative liability relief, federal grants and loans to facilitate revitalization, {{and state and local}} government initiatives for economic development assistance, among others. The slow process of brownfields revitalization suppresses economic growth for entire communities, and poses a substantial threat to human health and the environment. This research provides insight into the root causes of the slow rate of remediation. This research looks into the overall understanding of the three different stakeholder groups (private, public, regulatory) as experts regarding the impact of costs and benefits associated with brownfield remediation projects when considering property owners as the fourth stakeholder group. The expert panel validates the notion that brownfield property owners are the primary decision-makers and it is their cost/benefit analyses that define and directly contribute to the rate of brownfield remediation projects. This dissertation offers a conceptual model of a brownfield property owner’s decision-making process when deciding whether to remediate or not and identifies factors and sources of information influencing the property owners’ decision, including the importance and reliability of each. An objective analysis of the data collected in this research suggests that property owners perceive zero net benefits exist to remediate, if their analysis focuses solely on the remediation [...] and not on the cost of the status quo of the existing contaminated property. It is also <b>apparent</b> that property <b>owners</b> use the least reliable sources of information when facing factors that have the most impact on their cost/benefit analyses. When decisions are made based on poor information, property owners may conclude that remediation is not beneficial and they may not take action to remediate...|$|R
5000|$|Commercium is a {{legal term}} {{relating}} to ancient Roman Law. The term refers to the general rule that the law of a community was {{for the members of}} that community only, and that the stranger was without rights. Commercium was the chief of the private rights, which Latin cities had originally not only with Rome but with each other. If a foreigner had no treaty to the contrary with the city in which he or she entered, that foreigner could be seized and enslaved then their goods could be taken as [...] bona vacantia (vacant goods, meaning things found without any <b>apparent</b> <b>owner).</b> Eventually a foreigner could rely upon the [...] ius gentium (the right of the nations) in lieu of a treaty. Nevertheless, the bond of commercium meant more than this. It meant that the Latin was admitted to the Roman methods of acquiring property and of contracting obligations. In Ulpians words [...] "Commercium est emendi vendendique invicem ius" [...] (Commerce is the right of buying and selling with each other) does not quite get across the actual definition of the right of commercium, therefore it must be taken as giving only a rough description of the term.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the response of}} Australian cats with lymphosarcoma to chemotherapy and/or surgery in relation to patient and tumour characteristics, haematological and serum biochemical values and retroviral status. DESIGN: Prospective study of 61 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma subjected to multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. PROCEDURE: An accepted chemotherapy protocol utilising l-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate and prednisolone was modified and used to treat 60 cats with lymphosarcoma. Clinical findings were recorded before and during therapy. As far as practical, cases were followed to death, euthanasia or <b>apparent</b> cure. <b>Owner</b> satisfaction {{with the results of}} chemotherapy was determined using a questionnaire sent after the completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: One cat, with lymphosarcoma limited to a single mandibular lymph node, was treated using surgery alone and was cured. The other 60 cats were treated using multi-agent chemotherapy, although seven cats with localised intestinal, ocular and subcutaneous lesions had these lesions partially (2 intestinal lesions) or completely (2 eyes, 2 intestinal lesions and a cluster of regional lymph nodes) resected prior to starting chemotherapy. The median survival time for these 60 cats was 116 days. Of the 60 cats, 48 rapidly went into complete remission following the administration of 1 -asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone (complete remission rate 80 %) and these cats had a median survival of 187 days. Three cats were censored from further analysis as their long-term survival data were uninterpretable because they died of causes unrelated to lymphosarcoma or were prematurely lost to follow-up. Twenty cats were classed as &# 39;long-term survivors&# 39; based on survival time in excess of one year and at least 14 were &# 39;cured&# 39; based on the absence of physical evidence of lymphosarcoma 2 -years after initiating treatment. In other words, of the 48 cats that reached complete remission, in excess of 29 % were &# 39;cured&# 39;. Despite detailed analysis, few meaningful prognostic indicators based on patient or tumour characteristics were identified, although long-term survivors {{were more likely to be}} less than 4 -years (P= 0. 04) and to have tumours of the T-cell phenotype (P= 0. 06). Excluding the one FeLV ELISA-positive cat with mediastinal LSA, 7 of 9 cats less than 4 years-of-age were long-term survivors (median survival time > 1271 days). There was a strong association between achieving complete remission and long-term survival (P = 0. 003). On the basis of 27 replies to a questionnaire, owners were generally very satisfied with the response to chemotherapy, irrespective of the survival time of the individual patient. Eighty five percent of owners expressed complete satisfaction with their decision to pursue chemotherapy and 70 % believed their cat&# 39;s health status improved during the first 2 -weeks of treatment. Importantly, 78 % of owners considered that chemotherapy required a very substantial time commitment on their part. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to cure approximately one quarter of cats with lymphosarcoma using sequential multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. FeLV-negative cats younger than 4 years (typically with mediastinal lymphosarcoma) had a particularly favourable prognosis. The decision to embark on chemotherapy should be based on the results of induction chemotherapy with l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone, as the response to this was a good predictor of long-term survival. Cats surviving the first 16 weeks of chemotherapy generally enjoyed robust remissions (in excess of 1 year) or were cured of their malignancy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{factors contributing}} to ICT adoption among SMEs in fashion industry and examines the impacts of the adoption on marketing capabilities and business performance. To identify the ICT adoption determinants, this study uses the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework developed by Tarnatzky and Fleischer (1990), based on this framework, technological factors are examined using five factors namely relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Meanwhile, the marketing capabilities are derived from marketing capability that was developed by Vorheis and Morgan (2001, 2005) and further modified by several researchers such as Morgan et al., (2003), Theoharakis and Hooley (2003). Furthermore, business performance is analyzed by using SMEs’ owners/managers perception on their business performance including revenue growth, profit growth, as well as number of employee growth. The findings confirmed that technological, organizational, and environmental factors play essential roles in the adoption of ICT among SMEs operating in the fashion industry. All technological factors namely relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability are found to significantly influence the ICT adoption positively. Moreover, both owner/manager knowledge and owner/manager innovativeness were two organizational factors that contributed to ICT adoption. In regards to the environmental factors, this study shows that competitive pressure, market turbulence, and institutional intervention were important environmental factors influencing ICT adoption among SMEs. However, market turbulence shows significant but negative relationship to the adoption. This study further indicates that ICT adoption significantly and positively influences marketing capabilities namely planning flexibility, marketing implementation, product development, pricing, and communication. It also shows that among five dimensions of marketing capabilities, marketing implementation has the highest contribution, it seems that ICT adoption help SMEs to better and faster execute marketing strategies. Finally, this research reveals that marketing capabilities namely planning flexibility, marketing implementation, product development, pricing, and communication have significant influence toward firm’s business performance. Marketing implementation {{is found to be}} one of marketing capabilities that have highest contribution to the business performance, marketing implementation is marketing activities associated with the ability of SMEs to allocate marketing resources, translate and execute marketing strategies into action quickly and monitor marketing performance. Furthermore, this current research has provided important theoretical contributions into the body of knowledge related to the technology adoption theory by adding new understanding on how this theory can be adopted in the firm level in fashion industry context, secondly, the resource-based view of the firm theory by strengthening and confirming how organizational capabilities enhance firm performance, and finally, linkage of technology adoption theory and resource based view of the firm theory by providing a new holistic perspective that relates the consequences of technology adoption model to the development of organizational capabilities and business performance. Moreover, the results provides several managerial and policy implications on how to increase the adoption of ICT among SMEs. There is a need to educate and train SMEs owners, employees, and business partners, such initiatives provide an opportunity to try various applications, and to use and leverage ICT for their businesses. Access to any formal/informal training seems to be crucial to improve SMEs knowledge, skill, and competency. One of the strategies is to offer proper ICT training with competency building training for SME owners and employees. Involvement in any networks, cooperation (third party such as companies and academic institutions), and cluster activities also enables SMEs to engage in informal training and development. Also, it is important that ICT benefits have to be believable and <b>apparent</b> for SME <b>owners.</b> Mentorship program can be one solution to support SMEs where successful adaptors can act as role models for other SME owners and allow them to transfer experience and expertise to other fellow SME owners. While this current study provides useful empirical insight, it has several limitations that must be acknowledged. This study employs a nonprobability sampling that limits the generalizations of the findings. Moreover, business performance measurements namely, sales and profit are based on respondent perception...|$|R
