5|$|Although Arsenal {{had been}} {{fighting}} relegation in both the two previous seasons, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> chairman's restriction on spending, Chapman nevertheless moved to Arsenal soon afterwards, attracted both by the London club's larger crowds and a salary of £2,000, double what he earned at Huddersfield Town. At Arsenal, Chapman immediately made an impact by signing 34-year-old Charlie Buchan, an England international and Sunderland's all-time record goalscorer, whom he made Arsenal captain.|$|E
5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> {{absence of any}} physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E

5|$|A {{combination}} of Federal and State funding was obtained, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> {{controversy over the}} number of stops and route, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on {{what was to be}} the 99th–105th Streets segment, which was projected to cost $17.48 million (worth about $ today). However, the city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, and in September 1975 construction on the line stopped, and the tunnels were sealed. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity of the streets above, and in case construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 {{and the death}} of his eldest son Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the wardship of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, but the pair eventually lost out to them. By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands <b>and,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E

5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E

5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders <b>and,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> fact he was stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E
5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to be the ones to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, {{the castle}} became {{increasingly}} valued for its hunting facilities {{rather than its}} military defences. It fell into disrepair <b>and,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> construction of new living quarters and service facilities, {{by the middle of}} the 16th century it was derelict. Henry VIII sold the property to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the castle buildings were demolished. It was not until the 19th century, when Mary and Fulke Greville Howard inherited the property, that the castle was renovated and restored. Victorian scholars examined the site, and it was opened to the public. In 1958 the castle passed into the custody of the state, which carried out further stabilisation work and a programme of archaeological investigation. In 1998 English Heritage passed the management of the site back to its current owner, Baron Howard of Rising, who continues to operate the castle as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Gregory faced {{opposition}} to his reign in Nyssa, and, in 373 Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium had {{to visit the}} city to quell discontent. In 375 Desmothenes of Pontus convened a synod at Ancyra to try Gregory on charges of embezzlement of church funds and irregular ordination of bishops. He was arrested by imperial troops {{in the winter of}} the same year, but escaped to an unknown location. The synod of Nyssa, which was convened in the spring of 376, deposed him. However, Gregory regained his see in 378, perhaps due to an amnesty promulgated by the new emperor Gratian. In the same year Basil died, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> relative unimportance of Nyssa, Gregory took over many of his brother's former responsibilities in Pontus.|$|E
