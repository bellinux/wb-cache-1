5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in a hung jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not understand that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E

40|$|Every day in America, <b>a</b> case of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> makes {{headlines}} {{across the}} television, newspapers, websites, and social media. These tragedies deeply affect those directly involved and the {{communities in which}} the crimes take place. Not only are individuals physically and mentally affected by <b>violent</b> <b>crime,</b> but communities and cities suffer an economic loss from rising <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates. Reducing the current rates of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> (robbery, assaults, rapes, and murders) can reduce costs for cities and taxpayers, while ultimately {{improving the quality of}} life for Americans. Research into what affects <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates lead to discoveries that unemployment, gun ownership, and more interestingly, temperature, were some of the factors that affects <b>a</b> cityâ€™s <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate. This study aims to expound on the temperature variable by examining a previously unstudied variable â€“ latitude â€“ on <b>a</b> cityâ€™s <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate. This study aims to conduct an economic analysis through multi-variable regressions in support of the hypothesis that the latitude of a city does in fact have significance in <b>a</b> cityâ€™s <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate.

25|$|A further factor making {{bank robbery}} unattractive for criminals in the United States is the {{severity}} {{with which it}} is prosecuted. Accounts at all U.S. banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a corporation of the federal government, bringing bank robbery under federal jurisdiction and involving the FBI. United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for bank robbery gives long prison terms, which are usually further enhanced by the use or carrying of loaded firearms, prior criminal convictions, {{and the absence of}} parole from the federal prison system. As with any type of robbery, the fact that bank robbery is also inherently <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> typically causes corrections administrators to place imprisoned bank robbers in harsher high-security institutions.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Dick Wolf {{developed}} a concept {{for a new}} television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially {{toyed with the idea}} of calling it Night & Day but then hit upon the title Law & Order. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.|$|E
25|$|Truth-in-sentencing (TIS) and {{abolition}} of parole were ultimately passed in a Special Session of the General Assembly with the House voting 89–7 and the Senate voting 34–4 {{in favor of}} the measure.

According to the law, prison sentences increased for offenders without prior convictions for violent crimes by 125 percent, 300 percent for those with a prior felony conviction that originally had a maximum penalty of less than 40 years, and 500 percent for those with a felony conviction of <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> that originally had a minimum penalty of more than 40 years.

A demonstration involving about two hundred Arubans took place that evening outside the courthouse in Oranjestad in anger over Twitty's remarks, with signs reading [...] "Innocent until proven guilty" [...] and [...] "Respect our Dutch laws or go home." [...] Satish Kalpoe's attorney threatened legal action over Twitty's allegations, which he described as [...] "prejudicial, inflammatory, libelous, and totally outrageous." [...] On July 8, 2005, Twitty read a statement that said her remarks were fuelled by [...] "despair and frustration" [...] and that she [...] "apologize to the Aruban people and to the Aruban authorities if I or my family offended you in any way." ...|$|E
500|$|Chancellor Wang Anshi, also {{a renowned}} prose stylist, wrote a work {{on matters of}} state justice in the 11th century. Wang wrote that private interests, {{especially}} of those seeking vigilante justice, should in almost all circumstances never trump or interfere with public justice. In the ancient Classic of Rites, Rites of Zhou, and [...] "Gongyang" [...] commentary of the Spring and Autumn Annals, seeking vengeance for <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> against one's family {{is viewed as a}} moral and filial obligation, although in the Rites of Zhou state intervention between the instigating and avenging parties was emphasized. Wang believed that the state of Song China was far more stable than those in ancient times and abler to dispense fair justice. Although Wang praised the classic avenger Wu Zixu (526–484 BC), Michael Dalby writes that Wang [...] "would have been filled with horror if Wu's deeds, so outdated in their political implications, had been repeated in Song times." [...] For Wang, a victim exacting personal revenge against one who committed an egregious criminal act should only be considered acceptable when the government and its legal system became dysfunctional, chaotic, or ceased to exist. In his view, the hallmark of a properly functioning government was one where an innocent man was never executed. If this were to occur, his or her grieving relatives, friends, and associates should voice complaints to officials of ever increasing hierarchic status until grievances were properly addressed. If such a case reached the emperor—the last and final judge—and he decided that previous officials who heard the case had erred in their decisions, he would accordingly punish those officials and the original guilty party. If even the emperor for some reason made a fault in pardoning a party which was truly guilty, then Wang reasoned that the only explanation for a lack of justice was the will of heaven and its judgment which was beyond the control of mortal men. Wang insisted that submitting to the will of heaven in this regard {{was the right thing to}} do, while a murdered father or mother could still be honored through ritual sacrifices.|$|E

2500|$|Because donor {{organs are}} in short supply, {{there are more people}} waiting for a {{transplant}} than available organs.

The 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay student, is a notorious such incident in the U.S. LGBT people, especially lesbians, may become the victims of [...] "corrective rape", <b>a</b> <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> with the supposed aim of making them heterosexual.

In addition, we find that MMLs in inland states lead to a reduction in crime in the nearest border state.
