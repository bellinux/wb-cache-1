40|$|Introduction: There {{are growing}} {{concerns}} about the emergence of resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Since the widespread <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACTs,</b> {{there has been a}} decrease in the systematic surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance in many malaria-endemic countries. The aim of this work was to test whether data on travellers returning from Africa with malaria could serve as an additional surveillance system of local information sources for the emergence of drug resistance in endemic-countries. Methodology: Data were collected from travellers with symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria returning from Senegal (n = 1, 993), Mali (n = 2, 372), Cote d'Ivoire (n = 4, 778) or Cameroon (n = 3, 272) and recorded in the French Malaria Reference Centre during the period 1996 - 2011. Temporal trends of the proportion of parasite isolates that carried the mutant genotype, pfcrt 76 T, a marker of resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and pfdhfr 108 N, a marker of resistance to pyrimethamine, were compared for travellers and within-country surveys that were identified through a literature review in PubMed. The in vitro response to CQ was also compared between these two groups for parasites from Senegal. Results: The trends in the proportion of parasites that carried pfcrt 76 T, and pfdhfr 108 N, were compared for parasites from travellers and patients within-country using the slopes of the curves over time; no significant differences in the trends were found for any of the 4 countries. These results were supported by in vitro analysis of parasites from the field in Senegal and travellers returning to France, where the trends were also not significantly different. Conclusion: The results have not shown different trends in resistance between parasites derived from travellers or from parasites within-country. This work highlights the value of an international database of drug responses in travellers as an additional tool to assess the emergence of drug resistance in endemic areas where information is limited...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{interventions}} {{to prevent and}} treat malaria have long existed. Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) simultaneously prevent bites by mosquito vectors, reduce vector abundance, and prevent further transmission to community members. Anti-malarial drugs such as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) effectively treat disease while minimizing the potential for drug resistance. Contextual, logistical, and household factors in malaria holo-endemic areas, however, threaten the effectiveness of malaria interventions. Research presented in this dissertation uncovers specific factors which contribute to malaria risk and compromise access, availability and compliance to anti-malarial interventions. Using spatial analytic methods, a household-level survey of Malawian children from 2007 was analyzed to explore associations of urbanicity factors with parasitemia prevalence. The same database was analyzed to evaluate whether proximity to health facilities, which distribute ITNs, was associated with ITN possession and compliance. A comprehensive survey of a community in Kenya was undertaken to assess factors that determine ITN use under a no-cost distribution scheme. Finally, the problem of ACT availability under a large, global, subsidy program was analyzed through a shop-level survey of certified retail shops in Tanzania. Results indicated that rather than following a sharp divide, malaria risk inversely follows a smooth gradient of urbanicity. ITN possession and use {{were found to be}} inversely vary with distance to nearest health facility. In Kenya, a direct to household distribution led to nearly universal ITN use, but heterogenities among age groups persisted. In Tanzania, it was found that demand for malaria medications and market competition factors influenced stocking and early <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACTs</b> in drug shops. Policy makers must consider the problems of proper classification of target locations when designing intervention plans. Distributional strategies which center of fixed locations will lead to geographic shortfalls in ITN use and possession, particularly among at highest risk for disease. Comprehensive programs which deliver ITNs directly to households can increase ITN possession and use, but inherent age based heterogeneities in use may compromise control efforts. The success of anti-malarial interventions will depend on multi-pronged approaches which account for proper measurement of target areas, logistics, targeting efficiency, and a deep understanding of household and provider factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} that an Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick would incorporate {{in the laws}} would be better put in the preamble to a constitution, because of their symbolic and educational value. They comprise two possible fundamental protections : the first is protection against discrimination (or the entrenchment of formal equality)  ; the second is protection against assimilation (or resultant equality). It is this second objective which stresses {{the need for the}} recognition of collective rights in New Brunswick, such as the right to distinct social, educational and cultural institutions and, by implication, the need for the most advanced form of autonomy possible for each distinct linguistic community. One may wonder whether the Act gives the courts of New Brunswick a clear enough indication of the objectives of the Legislature to allow them to put aside the restrictive concept of equality developed in the interpretation of human rights legislation in Canada ? It would seem that the preamble to the Act limits its purpose to a declaration of principle. This legislative intent is best demonstrated by the fact that no section giving a right of action to citizens is included. The Act also has some very important limitations that result from various difficulties of interpretation. These difficulties are enhanced {{by the fact that the}} Act itself is not constitutional in nature. Section 1 borrows its language from Section 2 of the Official Languages Act of Canada, this section having been interpreted in a positive but uncertain way in Air Canada v. Joyal. Given the fact that the purpose of the Act, as set out in the preamble, is to create a set of political principles for the government of New Brunswick, it is difficult to see where it could be given a wider interpretation than the Canadian Bill of Rights with regard to the term « equality ». Whatever success was obtained in the courts has depended on the fact that the rights set out were in each instance very clear. Section 2 is the most difficult to understand because it gives no indication as to the means through which the government of New Brunswick is to ensure equality between the linguistic communities. The reference to distinct institutions is extremely uncertain and could only be given some legal force if the courts were to recognize that they have the duty to determine the true meaning of the section in a discretionary manner. But here the Act does not provide for any sanction and reflects the intention of creating declaratory legislation only. Section 3 is more or less a declaration of intent. The problem raised by the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> of a declaratory nature was raised last year in the Forest case. The difficulty is that the declaratory judgment does not generally constitute an order given to the government or the Legislature to act in a specific way. In the United States, the Courts of Equity found that they could take into consideration the common interest in deciding whether there were obstacles to a mandatory order resulting from the application of declaratory legislation. In Canada, the courts have been very timid. One might ask whether the Act is likely to bring about a better understanding between the two linguistic communities of New Brunswick. Politically, it is obvious that the Act will not provide a true framework for political change. Legally, it can be said without doubt that the Act will not create any rights or bring about an era of judicial interventionism. However, even an implicit adoption of the concept of collective rights could mark a turning point in the relationship between the two linguistic communities in New Brunswick...|$|E
