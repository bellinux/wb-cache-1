500|$|In {{later years}} I {{learned that he}} had always liked me <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was worth educating, {{and for that reason}} he made an effort on this trip to get to know me. He did it cleverly. He knew that I was bewildered by some of the things {{expected}} of me as a candidate's wife ... Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E
500|$|From 1958 to 1959 Williamson {{worked for}} Harvey Comics collaborating with former EC artists Reed Crandall, Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of Jack Kirby (for Race to the Moon #2–3 and Blast-Off #1). [...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I {{remember}} {{going up to}} Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, <b>and</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> can follow this, it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E

60|$|Ireland! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of Robert Emmet, {{and that}} last speech of his before Lord Norbury; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of Tommy Moore, and his amatory verses: <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of Curran, Grattan, Plunket, <b>and</b> O'Connell; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of my uncle's ostler, Patrick Flinnigan; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of the {{shipwreck}} of the gallant Albion, tost to {{pieces on the}} very shore now in sight; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should {{very much like to}} leave the ship and visit Dublin and the Giant's Causeway.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 October 2008, at an inquest {{into the}} death, a police {{surveillance}} officer {{admitted that he}} had deleted a computer record of Cressida Dick's instruction that they could allow Menezes to 'run on to Tube as [...] not carrying anything.' At the inquest he told the court that 'On reflection, I looked at that <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> cannot actually say that.' The IPCC announced that it would investigate the matter ' highest level of investigation'.|$|E
2500|$|... "My 25 {{years in}} {{literature}} {{have not been}} easy. While fully aware of how weak and inadequate my efforts have been, I still feel like I've every reason to continue: I never came under somebody else's flag, and my writing, good or bad, it's {{not for me to}} judge, contained only what I myself felt <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> remained true to my own understanding of things, never violating for any fleeting reason the modest talent nature gave me. One of my guiding lights has always been my desire to tell my country the truth about itself. Whether or not I succeeded, is not for me to tell," [...] Pisemsky said in reply.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the seven}} years after she {{graduated}} college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: [...] "My parents did not like my choices <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was doing stupid things with my life, {{and they told me}} so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'" [...] As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond.|$|E

2500|$|Andrews {{was born}} in Bangor, Maine. His parents {{divorced}} when he was 12 months old. He was raised by his mother's parents in Pineville, Louisiana. They moved to Monroe, Louisiana, when he was ten years old. After he {{graduated from high school}} in Monroe, he decided to live with his mother in St. Louis. They did not get along very well. He said, [...] "I was young and set in my ways <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> knew everything like every child does." [...] He worked for his stepfather as a maintenance man at the motel that his stepfather managed. Andrews needed parts to repair a broken vacuum cleaner, so he went to the O.K. Vacuum repair shop co-owned by Rusty Wallace's father and uncle. Gary Wallace, Rusty's uncle, had a conversation with Andrews about vacuum cleaners and other topics. Gary Wallace offered Andrews a job. Andrews helped move the vacuum cleaner repair shop to a larger facility. Andrews worked closely with Rusty Wallace and the two got to know each other well. [...] After work, he helped fix Wallace's USAC stock car, starting in 1979. He moved with Wallace to the ASA in 1983 when the team won the championship. Wallace moved from USAC to NASCAR in 1984, and Andrews moved to Louisiana to run Wallace's Sportsman for his driver Nicki Fraisson. Andrews quit in 1986.|$|E
