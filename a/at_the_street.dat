25|$|Twelve {{years after}} Arnink {{moved into the}} new {{building}} he sold the business to his superintendent, Harry Knickerbocker. Wanting to expand the business, Knickerbocker again commissioned Montross. The second garage {{was similar to the}} first in decoration and overall form, save for an extra story at the top. It differed in its wide single garage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> level with no text and lacked the roofline finials.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{buildings}} on the lot. The main house is a two-story timber frame house on a stone foundation sided in clapboard with fish-scale shingle in {{the apex of the}} front cross-gable on the main hipped roof. The similarly cross-gabled west side projects slightly from just north of the main entrance, sheltered by a flat roof. There is a white picket fence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is an irregular shape, {{designed to fit}} its lot. The facades facing Woodward and Cadillac Square are sheathed in grey granite <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> level and limestone above; these facades have massive five-story Corinthian pillars modeled after the columns of the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum. The {{first floor of the}} building houses retail space, while the upper floors were designed as commercial offices.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the Reign of Terror, {{in spite}} of attacks in the Convention, in the press, and on {{placards}} posted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> corners, Grégroire appeared in the streets in his episcopal dress and performed daily Mass in his house. After Maximilien Robespierre's fall (the Thermidor), he acquired Robespierre's house (in present-day rue Bonaparte) from where he continued this practice. He was then the first to advocate the reopening of the churches (speech of 21 December 1794).|$|E
25|$|Stortinget is an {{underground}} rapid transit {{station on the}} Common Line of the Oslo Metro, Norway.

25|$|On February 16, 2017, Revis was {{involved}} in a street brawl in Pittsburgh around 2:40a.m. Revis was suspected to have attacked two men, knocking them unconscious. One follower attempted to record Revis on a cell phone, prompting Revis to snatch the phone and throw it out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> That night, Revis was charged for aggravated assault, robbery, terroristic threats and conspiracy stemming. Revis turned himself into police the following day and was released on non-monetary bond. All charges were dismissed March 15 after a friend of Revis testified that he was responsible for knocking the two men out.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2009, the NCPC {{released}} its Monumental Core Framework Plan, {{a comprehensive plan}} for creating places and spaces around the National Mall to increase the availability of space for new museums and memorials while adding residences and retail features {{that would make the}} city a more attractive place to live and work. The plan was adopted by the United States Commission of Fine Arts on March 19, 2009, and approved by the NCPC on April 2, 2009. The Monumental Core Framework Plan proposed adding a new visitor's center and memorial at Banneker Park, an intermodal transportation hub beneath Banneker Park, demolition of the Forrestal Building and its annex, and construction of apartment and office buildings along L'Enfant Promenade with retail and dining space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> level to accommodate tourists and residents alike. The framework plan also proposed covering over I-395 between Banneker Park and L'Enfant Plaza, covering over the CSX railway tracks (which currently cut L'Enfant Plaza off from the Forrestal complex of buildings), re-establishing Maryland Avenue SW between 12th and 7th Streets SW (it currently does not exist there, due to the presence of the railroad tracks), and restoring the view of the U.S. Capitol building along Maryland Avenue SW.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{massacre}} of Bulgarian civilians took part after the July battle of Stara Zagora when Gurko's forces had to retreat {{back to the}} Shipka pass. In {{the aftermath of the}} battle Suleiman Pasha's forces burned down and plundered the town of Stara Zagora which by that time was one of the largest towns in the Bulgarian lands. The number of massacred Christian civilians during the battle is estimated at 15,000. Suleiman Pasha's forces also established in the whole valley of the Maritsa river a system of terror taking form in the hanging <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> corners of every Bulgarian who had in any way assisted the Russians, but even villages that had not assisted the Russians were destroyed and their inhabitants massacred. As a result, as many as 100,000 civilian Bulgarians fled north to the Russian occupied territories. Later on in the campaign the Ottoman forces planned to burn the town of Sofia after Gurko had managed to overcome their resistance in the passes of Western part of the Balkan Mountains. Only the refusal of the Italian Consul Vito Positano, the French Vice Consul Léandre François René le Gay and the Austro–Hungarian Vice Consul to leave Sofia prevented that from happening. After the Ottoman retreat, Positano even organized armed detachments to protect the population from marauders (regular Ottoman Army deserters, bashi-bazouks and Circassians).|$|E

500|$|Philadelphia Inquirer {{architecture}} critic Inga Saffron {{described the}} Comcast Center as [...] "a respectable work of architecture" [...] that was [...] "dignified in its {{stance on the}} grid, generous in {{its relationship to the}} city, responsible in its treatment of the environment." [...] She felt the tower's shape reminded her of a giant flash drive. Saffron said the building excelled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> level, praising the plaza, concourse, and its connection to Suburban Station. In 2009 the Comcast Center was awarded the Urban Land Institute Award for Excellence in the Americas category for the transformation of what was once mostly a vacant lot into a transit gateway.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} has several Christmas traditions: {{it is known}} as the former production site of Frango mints and for the Walnut Room Christmas tree. [...] It also hosts an ornate decorated display windows series <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> level. The windows display includes thirteen themed windows along State Street that in recent years have displayed the themes of the unfolding of stories of Snow White, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Paddington Bear, The Night Before Christmas, Harry Potter, and Cinderella. [...] Annually a three-story tall conifer Christmas tree is brought in for the Holidays season. [...] In an effort to quell opposition to the merger/ conversion, Macy's made a formal statement of its intent to continue the traditions of a [...] Christmas tree, a seventh floor [...] "Frango" [...] viewing kitchen, and animated holiday window displays.|$|E
500|$|The ornate {{historical}} Chinese {{style of}} the theatre distinguishes itself from the Neo-Renaissance exterior of the Skinner Building.

Here, adorning the ceiling are plaster representations of wood brackets, beams, and carved reliefs painted in a [...] scheme and decorated with stenciled dragons and flower patterns. Carved cloud shapes screen light fixtures to create an indirect lighting effect as the viewer approaches the wooden, brass knobbed entry doors. The original central free-standing box office was replaced by the current box office located {{to the side of the}} entry as part of a 1979 renovation. The original Imperial guardian lions (Ruì Shī), commonly called foo dogs or foo lions, originally located outside the entry were moved inside as part of the 1979 renovation.|$|E

500|$|Lieven recounts how {{the rescue}} parties [...] "in their desperation,... were {{reckless}} with their lives" [...] {{in their attempts}} to find survivors; many were injured in small roof collapses, or suffered the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. Their endeavours saved lives throughout the remainder of the day and into the night, including a group of 18 men found at around 1:00am. They were the last survivors found. A total of 432 miners had died that day—although some bodies were not found until later—and 7 others died later in hospital or at home. A journalist from The Times wrote: [...] "The numbers are truly awful. We talk in awed terms of the decimation of a regiment in a bloody battle, but here a great community engaged in the pursuit of a peaceful vocation is threatened with the loss of at least a quarter of its able bodied manhood". On the surface the townsfolk waited for news; a reporter for The Dundee Courier thought: [...] "the scene at Senghenydd last night was depressing in the extreme. The streets were full of silent throngs of people who moved aimlessly about or stood stolidly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> corners." ...|$|E
