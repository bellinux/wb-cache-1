On one occasion in the 1890s, {{a party of}} gentlemen from the Croydon Club came riding into town and claimed that they had arranged a match against the Warrandyte Club <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to play them. They rode off in a huff. The Warrandyte Club apologised {{to them in the}} local press, but they never came back until 1910.|$|E

She had buried all of them with her own hands, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to console her. Within the same six months, the queen had even been taken as war booty and had had to bind the shoes of a queen who beat her and abused her. The king was the best lord she had ever known and his queen the worst woman.|$|E

500|$|From {{the advent}} of charts in the UK until 1969 several {{magazines}} and newspapers published their own charts, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> [...] "official" [...] singles chart. [...] In February 1969, however, Record Retailer and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile an official chart. [...] The Record Retailer chart is now considered by the Official Charts Company, the current compilers of the UK Singles Chart, to be the canonical source for number-one singles for the earlier part of the 1960s. [...] Charts compiled by Top Pops had fifteen number-one singles that did not reach the top spot in the Record Retailer chart; in comparison, a total of nine Top Pops number-ones did not top the rival New Musical Express chart. Seven Top Pops number ones did not top either of the other publications' charts. [...] Edwin Hawkins Singers' [...] "Oh Happy Day", Robin Gibb's [...] "Saved by the Bell", [...] Bee Gees' [...] "Don't Forget to Remember", and The Tremeloes' [...] "(Call Me) Number One" [...] all peaked at number two in both charts, Herman's Hermits' [...] "My Sentimental Friend" [...] and Don Fardon's [...] "Indian Reservation" [...] placed with one number two and one number three in each chart, and Stevie Wonder's [...] "My Cherie Amour" [...] reached fourth and third spot in the two charts.|$|E
500|$|At the September 2016 Family Research Council Action Values Voter Summit (VVS) in Washington, DC, where Republican {{presidential and}} vice presidential {{candidates}} Donald Trump and Mike Pence also spoke, Bevin [...] "both lamented {{and called for}} revolution and bloodshed to 'redeem' what [...] be lost" [...] if Hillary Clinton were to be victorious in the 2016 presidential election, according to one review of Bevin's speech. He used and echoed the language about [...] "the tree of liberty" [...] being refreshed by the blood of patriots and addressed his own family in the same regard– [...] "I have nine children ... it might be their blood [...] is needed." [...] A second review of the speech said Bevin [...] "urged young Americans especially to 'be bold' and to avoid the temptation to be silent {{in the face of}} left-wing ideologues attempting to remake America." [...] This review continued through [...] "Neville Chamberlains in the world" [...] contrasting with [...] "a Winston Churchill" [...] and [...] "It's a slippery slope.... First, we're killing [...] children , then it's 'Don't ask, don't tell,' now it's this gender-bending kind of 'don't be a bigot,' 'don't be unreasonable,' 'don't be unenlightened.'" [...] Before the final call to service and sacrifice in the speech, in this account, an audience member and then Bevin addressed [...] "hose blood will be shed" [...] in, as another account put it, [...] "violent metaphor." [...] Afterwards, Bevin was asked about the [...] "blood ... shed" [...] part of the speech and, according to a summary, [...] "appeared to say {{he was referring to the}} cost paid by men and women in uniform." [...] A third account of the VVS appearance said he had spoken without notes or teleprompter. Another account reported that he [...] "referenced the rise of the Nazis preceding the Holocaust twice, invoking German pastor Martin Niemöller's oft-cited quote that ends, 'then they came for me– <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> left to speak for me.'" ...|$|E

So {{much has been made of}} that fact over the years that it has been blown out of all proportion." [...] He added that, [...] "I remember that in the first half of that Test match at Christchurch, Roger Gould had a kick charged down and I went to pick it up one-handed...and knocked on. In a Test match! Then, in the second half, we got the ball and ran it from our own line. Gould gave me the ball <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in front of me except Allan Hewson, the All Black full-back. I tried to change hands and dropped the ball.

2500|$|Research on {{governance}} and teaching quality was conducted between 2009 and 2010 at AAU, Mekelle university (MU) and Jigjiga university (JU). [...] MU is a young, medium-sized university upgraded from a college in 2000 and JU {{is one of}} the twelve new small recently established universities. At AAU, long serving academics considered that governance had changed from democratic to autocratic. Previously, the three university bodies were strong and provided quality assurance but now the president had all the power with assemblies reduced to meetings and only a skeleton senate remaining. There were rules and regulations but they were ignored. Leaders were quarreling among themselves and preventing any attempt at change. University leaders used to be selected on merit, from those who had come up through the system, but now they were appointed by the government and their ability was questionable. There was no control from the university board since they were government officials with their own work and little interest in the university. Increasing numbers of academic staff were failing to attend their classes <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to check their attendance, research or student learning. The introduction of BPR had only produced another layer in the bureaucratic hierarchy, contrary to BPR recommendations to reduce hierarchy.|$|E
