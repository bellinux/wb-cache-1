40|$|<b>Automatic</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>press</b> {{is one of}} the key Ceramic {{machinery and}} equipments for pressing ceramic wall and floor tiles, and its frame withstands all of the work force when it works, so the work performances of the frame have an important impact on the structural performance of the entire <b>automatic</b> hydraulic <b>press.</b> Took the frame of 32. 8 MN <b>automatic</b> hydraulic <b>press</b> as research object, established its three-dimensional model through Pro/Engineer software and carried on contact finite element analysis for it by using the large commercial finite element software ANSYS to gain the stress and strain distribution of the frame, and then carried out a detailed analysis of the results. The work done can help to fully understand the structure properties of existing <b>automatic</b> hydraulic <b>press</b> and serve as guidance to further improve its performance, and at the same time provide a theoretical basis for the structural design of the same type of <b>automatic</b> hydraulic <b>press</b> frame.    </p...|$|R
50|$|Bloch {{was born}} to a Jewish family in Kansas City. In the 4th grade, Bloch found a hand press in his uncle's attic and began his first {{business}} as a printer. By {{the time he was}} 12, he had three <b>automatic</b> <b>presses</b> and was providing printing services to several Kansas City high schools. He sold his business to an Iowa college to use as a print course teaching model.|$|R

50|$|Most dashpot timers {{are used}} in sequential, {{automatic}} control applications where the completion of one operation causes the start of another process. Common applications include automatic milling machines, periodic lubrication, animated shop-window displays, staged start-up of pumps, <b>automatic</b> <b>presses,</b> and industrial washing machines. Dashpot timers are also used in motors, blowers, lighting, and control valves {{as well as in}} banking, retail, irrigation, and general industrial applications. Common problems with dashpot timers were variations in temperature, the entrance of dirt and other matter into the dashpot system, and general wear and tear of the system.|$|R
5000|$|Mercury Record Corporation {{was formed}} in the American city of Chicago in 1945 by Irving Green, Berle Adams, Ray Greenberg [...] and Arthur Talmadge. They were {{a major force in}} jazz and blues, {{classical}} music, rock and roll, and country music recordings. Early in the label's history, Mercury opened two pressing plants, one in Chicago and the other in St. Louis, Missouri. With the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>presses</b> and providing 24-hour turnaround, they went into direct competition with major recording labels such as Columbia, Decca, Capitol and RCA Victor.|$|R

50|$|In 1844, Carl August Reichenbach, {{nephew of}} the founder of KBA, Friedrich Koenig, and Carl Buz {{established}} the “Reichenbach’sche Maschinenfabrik” (Reichenbach's machine factory) in Augsburg.

5000|$|The [...] "Harris <b>Automatic</b> <b>Press</b> Company" [...] {{was founded}} by Alfred S. Harris in Niles, Ohio in 1895. The company spent the next 60 years {{developing}} lithographic processes and printing presses before acquiring typesetting company Intertype Corporation. In 1957, Harris acquired Gates Radio, a producer of broadcast transmitters and associated electronics gear, but kept the Gates brand name alive by putting the Gates sticker {{on the back of}} numerous transmitters that were labeled Harris on the front panels.|$|E
50|$|In the future, market {{demands for}} modern {{filtration}} industry {{are going to}} become finer and higher degree in separation, and particularly on the purpose of material recycling, energy saving, and green technology. In order to meet increasing demands for higher degree of dewatering from difficult-to-filter material, super-high pressure filters are required. Therefore, the trend in increasing the pressure for the <b>automatic</b> filter <b>press</b> will keep on developing in the future.|$|R
5000|$|In older washing machines, the {{permanent}} press setting sprays moisture during the spin cycle {{to maintain the}} moisture content of {{the permanent}} press fabrics above a certain specified limit to reduce wrinkling. [...] Most older clothes dryers feature an <b>automatic</b> permanent <b>press</b> setting, which puts clothes through a cool-down cycle {{at the end of}} the normal heated drying cycle. Modern dryers tend to include this as a standard feature.|$|R
