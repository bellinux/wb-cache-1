5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence. Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured <b>as</b> <b>slaves</b> in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{percent of}} the English adult male {{population}} is estimated to have died during the war, a rather large percentage by most standards. The impact on the Native Americans was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off <b>as</b> <b>slaves</b> that the entire Native American population of New England fell by sixty to eighty percent.|$|E

5|$|While the encomienda colonial labour-supply {{system was}} in the process of being established, slave raids became a part of the cycle of conquest. The Spanish would round up {{indigenous}} peoples, brand them <b>as</b> <b>slaves,</b> and trade them at ports on the Gulf of Mexico for horses and weaponry, allowing further conquest and the acquisition of new slaves for trade.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition recruited further forces on the march north to the Cuchumatanes. On the steep southern slopes they clashed with between four and five thousand Ixil warriors; a lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish besieged the city, and their indigenous allies penetrated the stronghold {{and set it on}} fire. This allowed the Spanish to break the defences. The victorious Spanish branded surviving warriors <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. Although heavily outnumbered, the Spanish cavalry and firearms decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Brian Blessed, Andy Secombe, and Lewis MacLeod voice, respectively, Boss Nass, {{the leader}} of the Gungan tribe who allies with the Naboo, Watto, a junk dealer on Tatooine who owns Anakin and his mother <b>as</b> <b>slaves,</b> and Sebulba, an aggressive, scheming podracer who is Anakin's rival.

5|$|Alvarado rested {{two days}} at Tazuzcalco, before {{proceeding}} to Miahuaclan, {{which had been}} abandoned by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of {{the province of the}} same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found {{that the majority of the}} inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b>|$|E
5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use <b>as</b> <b>slaves,</b> considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed {{as part of}} Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as slave labor. The ten-year plan would have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E

5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood <b>as</b> <b>slaves</b> with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|Bougainville {{questioned}} {{some of the}} men captured {{during the}} battle. He learned from them the disposition of men and materials all the way from Albany to Fort William Henry. Other captured British ended up <b>as</b> <b>slaves</b> to the Indians. Thomas Brown, who published a pamphlet that vividly described his captivity, spent almost two years in slavery, traveling as far as the Mississippi River before reaching Albany in November 1758.|$|E
5|$|Brycg stowe was a {{major centre}} for the Anglo-Saxon slave trade. Men, women and {{children}} captured in Wales or northern England were traded through Bristol to Dublin <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> From there the Viking rulers of Dublin would sell them on throughout the known world. The Saxon bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, whose diocese included Bristol, preached against the trade regularly and eventually it was forbidden by the crown, though it carried on in secret for many years.|$|E

5|$|Ibrahim {{used the}} {{confusion}} {{to land at}} Methoni in the Peloponnese. From Methoni, Ibrahim started pillaging the Peloponnese and taking many people <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> Ibrahim captured Tripolis but was stopped from capturing Nauplion by Kostantinos Mavromichalis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis. In retaliation, Ibrahim burnt down Argos before returning to Tripoli. Ibrahim decided to go with his army and join Reshid Pasha at Missolonghi in Central Greece. The Egyptians reached the city on December 12, 1825 and helped the Ottomans with the siege. On April 10, 1826, the city fell to the invaders and the city was sacked.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 and 1482, {{earthquakes}} {{destroyed the}} Jewish quarter, {{so that only}} 22 families remained in the city. After an epidemic of plague in 1498–1500, the Knights Hospitaller, who ruled the island at that time, expelled those of the remaining Jews who would not be baptized. In the next two decades, the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2,000 and 3,000 captured Jews who were kept <b>as</b> <b>slaves</b> to work on fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In 1627 Barbary Pirates {{from the}} Republic of Salé {{occupied}} Lundy for five years. The North African invaders, {{under the command}} of Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon, flew an Ottoman flag over the island. Some captured Europeans were held on Lundy before being sent to Algiers <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> From 1628 to 1634 the island was plagued by pirate ships of French, Basque, English and Spanish origin. These incursions were eventually ended by Sir John Penington, but in the 1660s and as late as the 1700s the island still fell prey to French privateers.|$|E

5|$|In 1851, the Oatman {{family was}} ambushed {{by a group}} of Ɖo:lkabaya Yavapai (though many historians argue that it is {{impossible}} to know whether or not these were Yavapai, or some other tribe). Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves <b>as</b> <b>slaves.</b> The story was widely published, and increased White settlers' fears of attack in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded <b>as</b> <b>slaves,</b> and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E
5|$|In the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers {{guarding}} {{their children}} from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work <b>as</b> <b>slaves</b> in the mine, never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the mine, the team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately crashing into the mine. The team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables.|$|E
