5|$|In the 2016 Presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton carried Virginia, {{marking the}} third {{consecutive}} win for the Democratic Party at the presidential level {{and the first time}} the state gave its electoral votes to a Democrat, who did not win the national Electoral Vote, since 1924. In contrast, the state gave Donald J. Trump the smallest percentage of Virginian votes for <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> Party presidential nominee since Thomas E. Dewey in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney earned over 50% of {{the vote}} in the precinct that {{included}} Trump Tower, one of two Manhattan voting precincts to do so (the other being the precinct that included the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel). However, although Trump received 23 votes in the district during the 2016 Republican primary, signifying the most votes of <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate there, there were 67 votes for his opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. In 2016, within the precinct that contained Trump Tower, 200 people voted for Clinton as opposed to 95 for Trump.|$|E

5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement needed only Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A Republican in the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E
50|$|Nelson's {{votes in}} the Senate often placed him {{at odds with the}} {{leadership}} of his party. A National Journal congressional vote rating from 2006 placed him to the right of five Senate Republicans (Gordon Smith, Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter, Susan Collins, and Lincoln Chafee). Mary Landrieu was the only other Democrat to place to the right of <b>any</b> <b>Republicans</b> (she placed to the right of Chafee). A similar 2007 National Journal congressional vote rating went evenfurther, placing him to the right of eight Senate Republicans (theabove five as well as Richard Lugar, Norm Coleman, and Mike DeWine), with Landrieu once again placing to the right of Chafee andbeing the only other Democrat to place to the right of <b>any</b> <b>Republicans.</b> For 2012, the American Conservative Union rated his overall performance at 48 percent, the highest given to any Democratic senator.|$|R

5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E

Unlike in 2002, when Kerry was reelected against only third-party opposition, the Democratic nominee faced a Republican opponent in 2008. The Republican candidate, businessman Jeff Beatty {{who had lost}} a congressional race two years earlier, was not considered a serious contender in this overwhelmingly Democratic state. Massachusetts had not elected a Republican Senator since Edward Brooke in 1972 and has not sent <b>any</b> <b>Republicans</b> to Congress since incumbents Peter Torkildsen and Peter Blute were defeated in 1996.|$|R

25|$|Of all {{candidates}} {{for public office}} in the U.S., Portman was the top recipient of corporate money from insurance industries and commercial banks in 2010.

25|$|On November 5, 2007, the {{campaign}} raised over $4.3 million.

5000|$|Time {{magazine}} {{carried a}} report of some voters with Callaway stickers on their cars voting in the Democratic runoff, presumably for Maddox {{on the theory that}} he would be a weaker opponent for Callaway than would have been Arnall. Maddox received 443,055 votes to Arnall's 373,004; one Arnall aide attributed the entire Maddox margin to the Republican crossovers. However, the Marietta Daily Journal dismissed the crossovers and speculated that supporters of Jimmy Carter largely backed Maddox. Callaway denied having urged <b>any</b> <b>Republicans</b> to support Maddox: [...] "the losers always blame the other party." ...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{political}} dominance of one party or the other in many states, the real political races during this period would often be within the party primary. Indeed, in many southern states, there was hardly <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> Party at all, and the serious candidates of both the conservative and liberal kind were all Democrats. For example, in the southern states the race might be between a populist left-wing Democrat and a conservative Democrat in the primary, while in {{regions of the country}} such as the Midwest or New England in which the Republican Party was dominant, the race might be decided in the primary between a progressive Republican and a conservative Republican.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment hit {{a low of}} 5.3% in 1988 after peaking at over 10% in 1982. Real GDP growth {{recovered}} throughout Reagan's term, averaging +3.5% per year, with a high of +7.3% in 1984. The {{average annual}} GDP growth during Reagan's presidency was the fifth highest since the Great Depression and the highest of <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> president. Inflation decreased significantly, falling from 13.6% in 1980 to 4.1% by 1988, and 16 million new jobs were created. The net effect of all Reagan-era tax bills resulted in a 1% decrease of government revenues (as a percentage of GDP), with the revenue-shrinking effects of the 1981 tax cut (-3% of GDP) and the revenue-gaining effects of the 1982 tax hike (~+1% of GDP), while subsequent bills were more revenue-neutral. However, tax revenue itself nominally increased massively by 103.1% from 1981 through 1989, {{largely as a result}} of more loopholes abolished than tax rates lowered.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge's lukewarm {{support for}} Douglas in his 1858 senatorial {{re-election}} bid against Abraham Lincoln convinced Douglas that Breckinridge would seek the Democratic presidential nomination, {{but in a}} January 1860 letter to his uncle, Breckinridge averred he was [...] "firmly resolved not to". Douglas's political enemies supported Breckinridge, and Buchanan reluctantly dispensed patronage to Breckinridge allies, further alienating Douglas. After Breckinridge left open the possibility of supporting a federal slave code in 1859, Douglas wrote to Robert Toombs that he would support his enemy and fellow Georgian Alexander H. Stephens for the nomination over Breckinridge, although he would vote for Breckinridge over <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> in the general election.|$|E
25|$|When {{fundraising}} {{results from}} the second quarter were released, Romney had lent a total of $8.9 million to his campaign from his personal funds. From April to June, he spent $20.7 million, more than <b>any</b> other <b>Republican</b> candidate.|$|R
2500|$|When Cramer's two Republican {{legislative}} {{colleagues in}} 1951 named him minority leader, the Democrats teased them for [...] "caucusing {{in a phone}} booth." [...] Because the Florida legislature operates under {{the rules of the}} United States House of Representatives, Cramer was able to assert political [...] "minority rights;" [...] he raised his personal and the party visibility in state politics. In the state House, Cramer defended junior colleges from challenges waged by the four-year institutions. Having attended a two-year institution, Cramer considered junior colleges essential to lower-cost educational opportunities for state residents. Cramer worked to establish the state's first anti-crime commission, but the Democrats refused to name <b>any</b> <b>Republicans</b> to the panel.|$|R

500|$|Cooper's first {{political}} {{service was}} {{as a member of}} the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, he was elected county judge of Pulaski County. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1939, he joined the U.S. Army in 1942. During World War II, he earned the Bronze Star Medal for reorganizing the Bavarian judicial system after the allied victory in Europe. While still in Germany, he was elected circuit judge for Kentucky's 28th district. He returned home to accept the judgeship, which he held for less than a year before resigning to seek election to A.

500|$|Mathias' {{disagreements}} {{with the administration}} became well-known, causing columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak to name him the [...] "new supervillain... in President Nixon's doghouse". Evans and Novak also commented that [...] "not since [...] was defeated with White House connivance has <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> so outraged Mr. Nixon and his senior staff as Mathias. The senator's liberalism and tendency to bolt party lines have bred animosity in the inner sanctum". Due to their differing ideologies, there was speculation that Mathias {{was going to be}} [...] "purged" [...] from the party by Nixon in a similar manner as Goodell in 1971, but these threats disappeared after the Watergate scandal escalated. By the numbers, Mathias sided with the Nixon administration 47% of the time, and voted with the majority of his Republican colleagues in the Senate 31% of the time, during his first term.|$|E
500|$|True to his word, Buckner {{never again}} met Bradley {{in a joint}} debate. Rumors began to {{circulate}} that Buckner was afraid to meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors. The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J. Durham and State Senator Albert Seaton Berry, criticizing the Democratic record in the state. The Democratic Henderson Gleaner was also critical, opining [...] "We {{should be ashamed of}} ourselves." [...] Throughout the state, Bradley hammered the issue of the blind trust afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury. Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of <b>any</b> <b>Republican</b> gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's black voters. His concerns about the state treasury proved valid: When Buckner ordered an audit of the treasurer's books in 1888, Treasurer James [...] "Honest Dick" [...] Tate fled with $250,000 from the state treasury. He was never found.|$|E
5000|$|Semon {{filed for}} {{re-election}} to the House in 1936. Semon and Boivin were assured of re-election because no other Democrats or <b>any</b> <b>Republicans</b> filed {{for the two}} District 32 seats. The two incumbents won the Democratic primary unopposed and the republican primary with write-in votes. Semon won the Republican primary 179 write-in votes. [...] During the 1937 regular session, Boivin was elected Speaker of the House. He appointed Semon {{as chairman of the}} ways and means committee. Semon was also appointed to the agriculture, irrigation and drainage, and engrossed and enrolled bills committees.
