5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice</b> but {{can develop}} a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E

2500|$|Alice is a 14-year-old undine for Orange Planet. She first appears (in volume 3 of Aria/episode 3 of Aria the Animation) as a standoffish, {{detached}} girl. Aika later {{describes her}} as anti-social and complains about her tendency {{to put on}} a grim face and speak in <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> Alice speaks in a deadpan manner, though she frequently uses [...] as an intensifier. Although initially only a Pair, her rowing already surpasses both Aika and Akari's—for which skill she was scouted by Orange Planet despite her young age.

Because of her age and lower status, Aika often addresses her as [...] Through her friendship with Akari and Aika, Alice lightens up as the series progresses, though she still struggles with her detachment.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist author Bob Woodward in {{his book}} on the CIA reports his meeting with Helms in 1980. Apparently the edginess of Helms was not nervousness, but {{indicated}} an exquisite awareness of his surroundings, wrote the investigative reporter. In 1989 Woodward called Helms [...] "one of the enduring symbols, controversies and legends of the CIA". Kissinger observed that Helms [...] "was tempered by many battles" [...] and [...] "was strong as he was wary." [...] Urbane and tenacious, [...] "his smile did not always include his eyes." [...] Former CIA official Victor Marchetti admired Helms for his office foresight, noting [...] "that not {{a single piece of}} paper existed in the agency which linked Helms to... the Bay of Pigs." [...] Intelligence author Keith Melton describes Helms as a professional, always impeccably dressed, with a 'low tolerance for fools'; an elusive man, laconic and reserved. About Helms author Edward Jay Epstein writes, [...] "I found him to be an elegant man with <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> who could come right to the point." ...|$|E
