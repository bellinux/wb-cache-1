25|$|In general, {{development}} {{entails a}} modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), and a {{move away from}} low value added sectors such as agriculture <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> extraction. Developed countries, in comparison, usually have economic systems based on continuous, self-sustaining {{economic growth in the}} tertiary sector of the economy and quaternary sector of the economy and high material standards of living. However, there are notable exceptions, as some countries considered developed have a significant component of primary industries in their national economies, e.g., Norway, Canada, Australia. The USA and Western Europe have a very important agricultural sector, and are major players in international agricultural markets. Also, natural resource extraction can be a very profitable industry (high value added), e.g., oil extraction.|$|E

The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente—FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteção das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil—PPG-7) {{was supported by the}} world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.|$|E

He had to fight a widespread fire after a July storm started more than 150fires in Idaho's Kaniksu National Forest. He was put in charge of supporting and provisioning one of the crews led by the Forest Service. As he later recalled, Marshall worked [...] "18 to 20hours a day as time-keeper, Chief of Commissary, Camp Boss, and Inspector of the fire line". [...] Spending time with loggers and fire fighters, and seeing the conditions under which they worked, Marshall learned vital lessons about labor issues <b>and</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> use.
