However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector.

5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed {{as part of an}} integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E

He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film.

5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E
