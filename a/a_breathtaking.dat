25|$|India {{began their}} match against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells on 18 June 1983 disastrously. The Zimbabwean bowling attack, led by Peter Rawson (3/47) and Kevin Curran (3/65), {{destroyed}} the Indian top order, reducing them to 17/5. A massive {{upset by the}} Zimbabweans and another early exit for India was now {{very much on the}} cards, until Kapil arrived. Kapil completely changed the course of the match with <b>a</b> <b>breathtaking</b> innings (175 not out from 138 balls, 16 fours, 6 sixes). With the support of the tailenders, he ransacked the Zimbabwean bowling as he played his most famous innings, which was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket at the time and the first ever ODI century scored by an Indian batsman. As a result of his astounding knock, India finished the innings at 266/8. Then, a good performance with the ball from Madan Lal (3/42) saw Zimbabwe being bowled all out for 235, despite Curran's 73, to set up a famous win. Unfortunately, this match was not telecasted live due to a strike by the BBC staff on that day. But India's woes weren't over yet; they needed to beat Australia comprehensively to have any hope of reaching the semifinals.|$|E
25|$|India {{travelled}} to New Zealand to {{play their}} remaining Group matches. Their first match in New Zealand in this World Cup was against Ireland at Hamilton. Batting first on a perfect batting track, the Irish captain William Porterfield and middle-order batsman Niall O'Brien gave a massive scare to India as they scored half-centuries to propel Ireland to a formidable 206/3 in the 39th over, with the probability of them achieving a 300+ score high. However, Shami (3/41) and Ashwin (2/38) then triggered a collapse, with the Irish losing their last 7 wickets for just 53 runs to collapse to 259 all out. In reply, India were untroubled by the Irish bowling, with a blistering century from Dhawan (100 from 85 balls, 11 fours and 5 sixes), his second in the tournament, along with a half-century from Rohit (64 from 66 balls, 3 fours and 3 sixes) reducing the match to a no-contest as India scaled down the required target with 13 overs and 8 wickets to spare. India topped Group B with 1 match remaining due to the win. India's last match in the Group stage was against Zimbabwe at Auckland, a dead rubber since India had already topped Group B and Zimbabwe were no longer in contention for the quarterfinals with just a single win in this World Cup until this match. However, the match {{proved to be a}} thriller. Bowling first, the Indian pace attack struck early to leave Zimbabwe tottering at 33/3. But Zimbabwean skipper Brendan Taylor, who was playing his last match for Zimbabwe, scored a belligerent 138, toying with the spinners. With the support of Sean Williams, who scored 50, and then Craig Ervine, Taylor brought Zimbabwe to a solid position of 235/5 in the 42nd over after which he departed. A 300+ score was imminent at the time, but good death bowling from the Indian fast bowlers comprising Yadav (3/43) as well as Shami and Mohit, who both took identical figures of 3/48, saw Zimbabwe lose their last 5 wickets for 52 runs to be bowled all out for 287. India's reply began shakily, with a 2-wicket maiden over from Tinashe Panyangara accounting for both openers Rohit (16 from 21 balls, 2 fours) and Dhawan (4 from 20 balls, 1 four) early in the innings. Due to good bowling and fielding from the Zimbabweans, the defending champions were soon struggling at 92/4 in the 23rd over and an upset win by Zimbabwe seemed likely. But Raina (110 not out from 104 balls, 9 fours and 4 sixes) scored <b>a</b> <b>breathtaking</b> century under pressure. Though he began his innings scratchily, struggling against the short ball, he soon developed confidence and hammered the Zimbabwean bowling with the support of Dhoni (85 not out from 76 balls, 8 fours and 2 sixes), who secured yet another victory in the World Cup for India in his trademark style by hitting a sixer with just 6 runs to win in the 49th over. India finished the Group stage with an all-win record.|$|E

[...] An estimated 11,000species of seed-bearing plants and 400species of land or water vertebrates live in the Everglades, but slight variations in water levels affect many organisms and reshape land formations. The health and productivity of any ecosystem relies on the number of species present: the loss of one species weakens the entire ecosystem.|$|E

500|$|Music critic Green Baron {{reviewed}} {{the music for}} Sputnikmusic, and said: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club itself was <b>a</b> <b>breathtaking</b> motion picture driven by the extraordinary performances from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.

[...] Baron thought that Dallas Buyers Club was saved by a few excellent songs, which were [...] "Ready to Be Called On", [...] "After the Scripture", and [...] "City of Angels". He said that, [...] "Overall, the Dallas Buyers Club soundtrack is one that really isn't worth your time or money. Aside from three superb songs, the whole album is a collection of drab indie pop/rock that ultimately falls flat due to its lack of memorability." ...|$|E

Alan Ross, writing in The Times Literary Supplement wrote that Casino Royale was [...] "an extremely engaging affair", and that [...] "the especial charm... is the high poetry with which he invests the green baize lagoons of the casino tables". He concluded that the book was [...] "both exciting and extremely civilized". Reviewing for The Listener, Simon Raven believed that Fleming was a [...] "kind of supersonic John Buchan", but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot, observing that it is [...] "a brilliant but improbable notion" [...] that includes [...] "a deal of champagne-drinking, bomb-throwing, relentless pitting of wits etc... with a cretinous love-affair".

[...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M. C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison." [...] The New York Post gave the film a four-star rating and Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "DiCaprio, who has never been better as the tortured hero, draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans."

The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is <b>a</b> <b>breathtaking</b> balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell."

500|$|Lawrence O'Toole of Maclean's {{believed}} {{it was one of}} the series' best entries. [...] "Of all the modern formulas in the movie industry, the James Bond series is among the most pleasurable and durable. Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, A View to a Kill, is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with <b>a</b> <b>breathtaking</b> ski chase in Siberia, A View to a Kill is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels. But none of the action prepares the viewer for the heart-stopping climax with Zorin's dirigible tangled in the cables on top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge." [...] And although O'Toole believed that Moore was showing his age in the role, [...] "there are plenty of tunes left in his violin. James Bond is still a virtuoso, with a licence to thrill." ...|$|E

Black Rhythm Happening picks up where Ghetto Music left off, in that it takes the soul and free jazz elements of his debut and adds to them the sound of the church in all its guises...

500|$|Crystal Palace met Manchester United in {{the first}} week of October, looking to {{capitalise}} on their defeat to Leeds. Ferguson had anticipated that their midweek triumph at home to Italian giants Juventus would act as the [...] "spark" [...] to their league form. A 2–0 win – their first in four attempts – put them a point behind league leaders Arsenal. The first ever sell-out game at Derby's new £20million Pride Park stadium saw the home side take a commanding 2–0 lead through Paulo Wanchope and Francesco Baiano. A third defeat in five games was on the cards for Alex Ferguson's side after Teddy Sheringham missed his second penalty of the season, but he quickly made amends, connecting his head with Gary Neville's inch-perfect cross. Cole, who was dropped from the first team for the Champions League tie at home to Feyenoord, came on with fifteen minutes of normal time remaining and grabbed a vital equaliser, drilling a low shot past the wretched Derby defence. Old Trafford welcomed Barnsley for the first time in over 60 years and a rampant United display helped them leapfrog Arsenal to the top of the Premiership for the first time since early September. Andy Cole bagged a first half hat-trick and Scholes, Ryan Giggs (2) and Poborský followed up with goals in <b>a</b> <b>breathtaking</b> performance that gave the Tykes their ninth league defeat of the season.|$|E
