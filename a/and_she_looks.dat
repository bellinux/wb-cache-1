His portrait of painter Lydia Field Emmet in 1892 depicts Emmet in a pose typically reserved for men in old masters' paintings. Emmet's hand is on her hip <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> over her shoulder at the audience.|$|E

As she reaches the little bed, the clock strikes midnight <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself {{in the midst of a}} battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king. They begin to eat the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid {{is absent}} {{during the first}} part of the fifth novel. The {{character}} later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

500|$|Naughty Dog {{designed}} Elena as a sidekick and {{a romantic}} interest to Drake, and her personality to complement his. However, she proves just as capable as Drake at gun battles and resourcefulness. Her voice actor commented, [...] "In the first game, she's a lot younger, she's {{a lot more}} naive, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at things as being very possible, {{and in the second}} (game), has seen murders and adventure...the way that any person grows, you see that in her. She's a little bit more hesitant, a little more cynical". Commentators have mentioned how unusually strong and resilient Fisher is for a female character, and GamesRadar UK called her one of the strongest heroines in video gaming.|$|E
500|$|For {{the only}} time in this series, Angelou {{describes}} her son's accident in detail at both the end of this book and the beginning of her next one, All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes, a technique that centralizes the two books, connects them with each other, creates a strong, emotional link between them, and repeats Angelou's pattern of ending each book on a positive note. In this book, Angelou ends with a hopeful look to the future as her son attains his independence <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> forward to hers. Hagen writes, [...] "Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival, sense of self, and continuing education, The Heart of a Woman moves its central figures to a point of full personhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said that}} the most common {{complaint}} that he received about JC's Girls was [...] "the way Heather Veitch looks... her breasts are too big <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> too much like a stripper", a complaint to which he responded that [...] "God can use any individual to change the world". Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress like sex workers, but she {{said that the}} look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said around the same time that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—"They say my T-shirt is too tight", said Lobert, [...] "but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does".|$|E

500|$|Other scenes show Rihanna {{dancing around}} the piano while the pianist is still playing. While her boyfriend is sleeping, Rihanna sends {{a text message}} to her lover, [...] "B down in 5". She walks {{down the street and}} gets into a car with her lover, who is the note-writing diner from the {{restaurant}} and the man who plays the piano at the rehearsal. As the song continues, Rihanna is shown regretfully embracing her lover near the piano. When the rehearsal finishes, she leaves the arena, where her boyfriend is waiting for her with his car. Rihanna hugs him and tears fall from her eyes. A reviewer from MTV Australia wrote about the video's theme and appearance, [...] "Cheaters always get busted. And this time around, Rihanna sings about being the one doing the two-timing. Secret notes, sneaking around, hearts broken... Oh, the drama. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> gooooood." ...|$|E
500|$|Bågenholm {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} at 21:10. Her body temperature {{at the time was}} , the lowest survived body temperature ever recorded in a human with accidental hypothermia, until fellow Swede Stella, 7 years old, survived [...] at Christmas 2010. Dr. Mads Gilbert, an anesthesiologist and the chief of the hospital's emergency room, proceeded with the resuscitation attempt. He commented on Bågenholm's state: [...] "She has completely dilated pupils. She is ashen, flaxen white. She's wet. She's ice cold when I touch her skin, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> absolutely dead." [...] Gilbert had treated many cases of hypothermia before because of the cold climate in Norway, and knew how to treat Bågenholm. The electrocardiogram connected to her showed no signs of life, but Gilbert knew patients should be [...] "warmed up before you declare them dead". He and his team hoped Bågenholm's brain had received enough oxygen from the CPR she was given after her rescue.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} received mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. In October 2000 Howard Rosenberg commented [...] "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping {{out the entire}} planet. It's actually quite moving. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> great on her bike." [...] Hal Boedeker from the Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review of Max, and compared her skills to those of Catwoman, Xena, Emma Peel and Wonder Woman. Time commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had [...] "an emotional range unusual among action babes." [...] Conversely, Joyce Millman said [...] "Cameron and Eglee give us very little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way we care about Buffy or Faith. And that's because Max {{is little more than}} lips and ass and a premise reminiscent of other, better shows". In December 2000 People listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the breakthrough performances of 2000.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{has been}} married four times. In 1961, she married Jerry Smith, a ferroanalyst at the Inter-Lake Iron Corporation in Beverly, Ohio. They had one child {{together}} on March 9, 1963, named Darren Justin. (In the late 1970s, Darren went to Europe to become a missionary; he is currently a psychologist.) In the mid-1960s, the couple divorced and Smith married the guitarist in her touring band, Jack Watkins. They had a son, Kerry Watkins, before separating nearly a year after marrying. Shortly afterward, Smith married telephone repairman Marshall Haynes. In the early 1970s, Haynes frequently toured with Connie on her road show. The couple had three daughters: Jeanne, Julie, and Jodi Haynes. After divorcing Haynes in the early 1990s, Smith stated {{that she would never}} marry again, but on July 8, 1997 Smith married country artist Marty Stuart. They met while writing songs for Smith's 1998 comeback album. Twenty-six years before, Stuart had first encountered her after attending her concert: [...] "I met Connie when I was 12 years old. She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown to work at a fair. She hasn't changed a bit. She looked great then <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> great now." [...] Smith accounts for the fact they have sustained their marriage as follows: [...] "Make the Lord the center … and commit." ...|$|E
500|$|The concert {{opened with}} Spears taking the stage {{accompanied}} by four blonde female dancers {{to perform a}} short version of [...] "...Baby One More Time", wearing a silver beaded bra, a pleated white skirt and white boots. She wore a long brown (blond in later dates) wig to cover the head she had shaved {{two and a half}} months previously and appeared in physically good shape. (By now her hair was about an inch long, and one of her dancers said of her hair without the wig, [...] "It's getting longer <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> beautiful.") The show then segued into a flashy shortened version of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". Though while Spears performed the original choreography, the performance was compared to the style of the Pussycat Dolls. The dancers then left Spears alone onstage to perform a chair routine of [...] "Breathe on Me". They re-entered with a male fan from the audience with them and Spears giving him a lap dance. Half way through the lap dance, Spears disappeared for a costume change leaving her dancers to continue the performance. She then reappeared in a hot pink bra, white fur coat and jean skirt to perform [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] with Spears throwing air guitars to the crowd. The show then concluded with [...] "Toxic", which featured Spears and her dancers performing in a mix of Spears and Shakira dance styles. As the performance came to an end, Spears said [...] "Thank you so much. These are my dancers"– her only words during the show– and left the stage. The show lasted around 12–16 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The figure symbolizing {{poetry is}} the only one of the three figures that faces the relief of Heine. It also faces towards a rose, which is {{supposed}} to express a particularly intimate relationship between poetry and Heine. From the right of the Heine-relief is the figure of satire, which turns her upper body towards Heine. In the back of the monument is positioned the [...] "melancholy". The hair of the figure is long and unadorned, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> down sadly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Cupid and Psyche are fixed onto a long, vertical canvas. They appear long and larger than life. Cupid places a leg on a cloud for balance, and similarly balances the frame. Limbs interconnect in soft embraces. Bouguereau catches Cupid and Psyche in an inhale of breath, placing a light peck on Psyche’s cheek. Her hand almost pushes Cupid away, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> down {{and away from}} him. The blue cloth floats behind them and onto the surrounding clouds. The {{focus is on the}} subjects, who are above the earthly realm and gracefully play in the sky.|$|E
2500|$|Up until 1788, {{portraits of}} Charlotte often depict her in {{maternal}} poses with her children, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> young and contented; however, {{in that year}} her husband fell seriously ill and became temporarily insane. It is now thought that the King was suffering from porphyria, {{but at the time}} the cause of the King's illness was unknown. Sir Thomas Lawrence's portrait of her at this time marks a transition point, after which she looks much older in her portraits; the Assistant Keeper of Charlotte's Wardrobe, Mrs. Papendiek, wrote that the Queen was [...] "much changed, her hair quite grey".|$|E
2500|$|Ash was not {{a regular}} viewer of Holby City prior to her casting, but started that: [...] "I'm {{actually}} quite surprised by the powerful women in the show and proud to be one. The scripts are brilliant and it’s very fast moving. It's a joy going to work every morning." [...] She admitted to being nervous about her on-screen appearance prior to the broadcast of her first scenes, as she faced media ridicule in 2002 when an allergic reaction to collagen lip implants left her with a severely swollen mouth. She commented: [...] "I'm nervous about when it goes out on screen {{for the first time}} - I'm worried that people will think, 'She doesn't look very good <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> old'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of Chawla's films {{released}} in 1994–6 were unsuccessful, though {{she appeared in}} Saajan Ka Ghar alongside Rishi Kapoor; Ram Jaane alongside Shahrukh Khan, Naajayaz alongside Ajay Devgan and Loafer alongside Anil Kapoor {{all of which were}} moderately successful at the box office. She received critical accalaim for her performance of a battered wife in Abbas Mustan's thriller Daraar and she received a Filmfare nomination for her performance in the film [...] Critics praised her performance immensely, they wrote [...] "Juhi was really amazing in the second half. She is both vulnerable and powerful, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> gorgeous. Her portrayal of the abused woman, who simply decides that enough is enough, is extremely sensitive and believable. She breaks your heart pleading with her husband as he prepares to give her a beating, you fear for her in her plight, and you are proud of her once she faces him." ...|$|E
