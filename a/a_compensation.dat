5|$|According to Suetonius, {{the people}} of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification {{immediately}} after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting. As <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E
5|$|The Hospitallers made raids against Hama, Homs and Latakia {{from their}} castles in Bohemond's realms. Al-Adil I, the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus and Egypt, blamed Bohemond for the knights' actions. Al-Adil {{broke into the}} County of Tripoli, forcing Bohemond to pay <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> in 1208 or 1209.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E

5|$|In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel {{ended its}} {{operations}} {{from the building}} as the hotel faced increasing competition in the hospitality industry. At {{the time of its}} closure, the hotel was operating only 40 rooms that were equipped with a double-bed and a ceiling fan, catering mainly to budget travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia. The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> sum.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyper{{parathyroid}}ism. When too much calcium is lost, there is <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|The Athletics {{have failed}} to sign three first-round draft picks, {{although}} they did not receive <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> pick for any of them. The first such player not signed was Pete Broberg in 1968. The A's also failed to sign both of their draft picks in 1979, Juan Bustabad and Mike Stenhouse. The Athletics have had ten compensatory picks overall since the first draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.|$|E

5|$|The Interzonal tournament {{was held}} in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) {{qualified}} for the Candidates Tournament. Bobby Fischer had not qualified {{to play in this}} event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (Zonal). However, Benko (and the reserve Lombardy) gave up his spot, and FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. <b>A</b> <b>compensation</b> of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was written {{off after the}} accident. Immediately after the accident, Widerøe paid <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> of NOK10,000 {{to each of the}} survivors.

5|$|The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States as {{a result}} of the latter's victory in the Spanish–American War. <b>A</b> <b>compensation</b> of US$20million was paid to Spain {{according}} to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. As it became increasingly clear the United States would not recognize the nascent First Philippine Republic, the Philippine–American War broke out, the First Republic was defeated, and the archipelago was administered under an Insular Government. The war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians, mostly from a cholera epidemic.|$|E

5|$|These events {{led to a}} {{conflict}} with Ivan Sratsimir, who was in turn given the rule of Vidin, probably as <b>a</b> <b>compensation.</b> Another indirect piece of evidence for the feud {{is the fact that}} Ivan Sratsimir's portrait not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander, where the whole family of the emperor was otherwise presented. In 1356 Ivan Sratsimir proclaimed himself emperor of Vidin. Together with his father and younger brother Ivan Asen V, Ivan Shishman presided over the church synods at Tarnovo in the late 1360s.|$|E
5|$|With <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> package agreed Mills left Tamworth {{after being}} {{appointed}} {{the manager of}} fellow Conference Premier club York City on 13 October 2010. He replaced Martin Foyle, who resigned the previous month, {{and at the time}} of his appointment York were 16th in the table.

After his appointment, Mills said he believed he had left Tamworth for a club with greater potential and that his aim was to return York to the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Although for a {{few decades}} (since the times of the Silent Sejm) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate, Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which {{the forces of the}} Bar Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over Poland. The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in Poland through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E
50|$|A merger {{begins when}} one company, the acquirer, makes {{an offer to}} {{purchase}} the shares of another company, the target. <b>As</b> <b>compensation,</b> the target will receive cash at a specified price, the acquirer's stock at specified ratio, {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|R

50|$|The {{sense of}} {{exposure}} compensation is opposite {{that of the}} EV scale itself. An increase in exposure corresponds to a decrease in EV, so <b>an</b> exposure <b>compensation</b> of +1 EV results in a smaller EV; conversely, <b>an</b> exposure <b>compensation</b> of −1 EV results in a greater EV. For example, if a meter reading of a lighter-than-normal subject indicates EV 16, and <b>an</b> exposure <b>compensation</b> of +1 EV is applied to render the subject appropriately, the final camera settings will correspond to EV 15.|$|R
5|$|Charles re-signed for Ebbsfleet {{after joining}} on loan for 2008–09 on 21 June. He fouled Simon Brown to concede a penalty kick against Wrexham on 13 September 2008, which was scored by Brown, as Ebbsfleet lost 3–2. He was sent {{off for a}} second bookable offence late into a 1–0 defeat to Histon on 6 October 2008. After his Brentford {{contract}} was cancelled he moved to Ebbsfleet permanently on 29 January 2009, after the owners of Ebbsfleet, MyFootballClub, ratified <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> fee of £25,000, making this the first transfer in football history {{to be decided by}} a group of members. He finished the season with 44 appearances and was named Ebbsfleet's Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the humiliation of the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been given the same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E
5|$|However, {{controversy}} arose during rolling-stock selection. In May 1999, as THSRC faced {{difficulties in}} raising capital, {{the government of}} Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC's financial offerings, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offered the newer 700 Series Shinkansen, convinced THSRC to reopen core system bid, and ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred rolling-stock supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment. THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.|$|E
50|$|The precise route was {{initially}} contested. The towns of Kelheim and Abensberg both wanted a direct railway link. The Kelheim option would have involved {{the construction of}} an expensive tunnel; as a result of which Abensberg eventually won the day. <b>As</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>a</b> 5.5 km long stub line was built between Saal and Kelheim, that was ceremoniously opened on15 February 1875. Passenger services on this branch were withdrawn in 1986.|$|R
50|$|All {{personnel}} are paid <b>a</b> basic <b>compensation</b> ranging from 4 Swiss francs {{a day for}} a recruit to 30 for a Lieutenant General.

50|$|The {{construction}} of the railway bridge below the river bend was to result in tall-masted schooners being {{no longer able to}} pass under what was now known as the 'red bridge'. <b>As</b> <b>compensation</b> for this, <b>a</b> new 'steamers' quay' was constructed just down river.|$|R
5|$|In October of the 2013–14 season, Holloway quit as manager, {{with the}} club having only taken three points from the first eight games of the season. He was {{replaced}} by former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, who led the team to safety. Pulis then resigned just {{two days before the}} start of the 2014–15 season. Neil Warnock returned to the club for a second spell as manager, but was sacked on 27 December {{with the club}} in the relegation zone. In January 2015, former Palace player Alan Pardew was confirmed as the new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club after <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> package of £3.5 million was agreed with Newcastle United. Under Pardew the club won eight games out of twelve in the new year, eventually securing mid-table safety and a third consecutive season in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, and Ștefan Răzvan, Voivode of Moldavia, {{acknowledged}} his suzerainty. Their united forces defeated an Ottoman {{army in the}} Battle of Giurgiu. The triumph {{was followed}} by a series of Ottoman victories, and Sigismund abdicated in favor of Rudolph II in early 1598, receiving the duchies of Racibórz and Opole as <b>a</b> <b>compensation.</b> His maternal uncle, Stephen Bocskai, persuaded him to return in late summer, but he could not make peace with the Ottoman Empire. He renounced Transylvania in favor of Andrew Báthory and settled in Poland in 1599. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged by unpaid mercenaries and Ottoman marauders. Sigismund returned {{at the head of a}} Polish army in 1601, but he could not strengthen his position. He again abdicated in favor of Rudolph and settled in Bohemia in July 1602. After he was accused of a conspiracy against the emperor, he spent fourteen months in jail in Prague in 1610 and 1611. He died at his Bohemian estate.|$|E
5|$|On 28 December 1263 Henry {{left for}} France {{to present his}} case to King Louis. Montfort was {{prevented}} from attending by an accident, and he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried once before, in September, {{to appeal to the}} French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded <b>a</b> <b>compensation</b> of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons.|$|E
