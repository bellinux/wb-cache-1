5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters had taken <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done}} by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E

5|$|In July 1934, {{as part of}} a depression-relief effort, the Carrying Place Trail through Prince Edward County and the United Counties of Lennox and Addington {{was assumed}} as an {{extension}} of Highway33. (The section between Trenton and Glenora was assumed on July4, 1934, the section between Adolphustown and Kingston on July11.) The provincially operated ferries, as the first to operate without <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the route, entered service after 1936.|$|E

5|$|Stora Henriksvik, {{also called}} the Bellman museum (Bellmanmuseet) for its small {{permanent}} Bellman exhibition, celebrates his life and work with paintings, replica objects and a beachside café in a 17th-century Stockholm house. The place, beside the beach at Långholm, was in Bellman's time called Lilla Sjötullen (The Small Lake-Customs House) where farmers from Lake Mälaren had to pay <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the goods they were taking to market in Stockholm's Gamla stan. The place is mentioned in Epistle No. 48, Solen glimmar blank och trind.|$|E
5|$|Taliban forces took up new {{positions}} {{to defend the}} town on 9 December. Taliban sources suggested {{at the time that}} militants from nearby areas were entering the town to reinforce its defence. Fighting was on-going through the day and bombs planted by insurgents continued to take <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> ISAF forces: an American soldier, Corporal Tanner J O'Leary of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was killed by the detonation of an improvised explosive device.|$|E
5|$|The 17th {{was first}} {{assigned}} to garrison duty at Fort Stanwix, where Montgomery remained until 1764. In 1764, Montgomery applied to Colonel Campbell and General Thomas Gage for leave {{to return to}} England, as his service in the Caribbean had taken <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> his health. Gage granted the leave, directing Colonel Campbell to give {{it as soon as}} possible. Campbell, whose officer ranks had been depleted in the Caribbean campaign, would only grant the leave after the upcoming expedition.|$|E

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on December 28, 1933 in Lexington, Kentucky. He was the only son of the five {{children}} born to John Y. and Dorothy (Inman) Brown. His father {{was a member of}} the U.S. Congress from Kentucky and a member of the Kentucky state legislature for nearly three decades, including a term as Speaker of the House. John Sr. was named for, but not related to, the nineteenth century governor of the same name. A 1979 People magazine article recounts that the elder Brown's nine unsuccessful political races – for either governor or the U.S. Senate – took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> his family and left his mother resentful of all the money spent on campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E

5|$|Despite finding like-minded {{students}} in Vienna, the city's climate took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Andrić's health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, {{then asked to}} leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been {{taking part in a}} protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones. For a time, Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He transferred in early 1914, and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{adults do}} not have many predators, but human {{activities}} pose many threats. Collisions with power lines, hunting, intentional poisoning, lead accumulation from ingesting gunshot in carcasses, and pesticide accumulation take <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> populations. Young birds at the nest are sometimes taken by golden eagles, eagle owls, and red foxes. Only rarely do adult birds attempt to drive away predators. Young birds that fall off of cliff ledges may be preyed on by mammalian predators such as jackals, foxes and wolves. Like all birds they serve as hosts for ectoparasitic birdlice including Aegypoecus perspicuus as well as organisms that live within them such as mycoplasmas.|$|E

5|$|In 1778, the British Army {{burned the}} city in {{retaliation}} for the acts of local privateers. The fire destroyed 34 ships, 76 shops, 26 storehouses and 11 homes. After independence, the city concentrated on rebuilding its major industry, and in 1791, the Rebecca set sail, becoming the first American whaler to harvest oil from the Pacific. Two decades later, the War of 1812 again took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the industry, which recovered again and by 1823, New Bedford's fleet equalled Nantucket's in tonnage. Four years later the city's whaling industry had surpassed the island's in barrels produced.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{eight people}} were killed and damage figures equated to US$71million. Widespread power outages took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> as many as 422,000homes and heavy rains flooded {{numerous}} fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine {{people were killed}} due to car accidents spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's affects resulted in the death of 28people and roughly US$295million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E

5|$|Tallon {{married his}} first wife Marjorie Beattie in 1946. The {{constant}} travel, interstate and overseas, took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> his marriage and the pair divorced in 1950. In 1954, he married Lynda Kirchner from his native Bundaberg, {{with whom he had}} two daughters. In retirement, Tallon helped his younger brother Mat in running a corner store in Bundaberg. His nephew Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 196768. The Tallon bridge, built in 1995 in Bundaberg was named after the famous Bundabergian which links west & north Bundaberg. He died of heart disease in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Treloar's work {{patterns}} took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> his health, and {{the deterioration}} in his performance after 1946 was possibly {{the result of}} exhaustion. Despite this, the Memorial's board did not intervene in the institution's management and allowed Treloar to remain in his position. In January 1952, Dawn found him ill in bed after noticing {{that he had not}} signed the attendance book. Treloar was subsequently admitted to the Canberra Community Hospital where he died on 28January {{as a result of an}} intestinal haemorrhage. His funeral was held two days later at Reid Methodist Church in Canberra, and he was subsequently buried in the returned soldiers section of Woden Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Judy, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Susang, was the third {{tropical}} cyclone to affect Japan during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season. Forming east of the Philippines in tandem with another system on September4, the disturbance continued to intensify, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on September6 and a typhoon on September8 while tracking northwestward. On September9, Judy attained its peak intensity, with winds of 150km/h (90mph). Thereafter, increased wind shear took <b>a</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the typhoon, as it turned northward on September11 {{in the general direction}} of Japan under the influence of a mid-latitude cyclone. Judy passed over southeastern Japan on September12; by this time, the typhoon had weakened considerably. Judy became an extratropical cyclone almost immediately thereafter.|$|E
