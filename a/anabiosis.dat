50|$|This {{microscopic}} nematode exhibits sexual dimorphism. The female is rounded {{and white}} and measures 680 by 930 micrometres. The male is vermiform and transparent and measures 40 by 1300 micrometres. The eggs are oval and the vermiform larvae moult four times. The second instar larvae are mobile and can travel distances of up to thirty centimetres, looking for and invading roots of suitable host species. Here they develop, growing into sedentary bottle-shaped third instar larvae and rounded fourth instar ones. These then develop into either females or males and mating takes place. The female retains {{the majority of the}} several hundred eggs she produces inside her body. She turns into a brown cyst by the end of plant growth season, as her external surface hardens and her internal parts die. The larvae may remain in <b>anabiosis</b> within this cyst for several years until suitable host plants become available. The cysts can withstand harsh conditions and can be spread in soil, by agricultural machinery, by animals, by wind, by dust storms or other means.|$|E
50|$|The female alfalfa cyst {{nematode}} {{is white and}} shaped like a lemon with a body length of 0.4 to 1.2 mm and a width of 0.2 to 0.9 mm. The male is vermiform with a body length of 1.2 to 1.4 mm and a width of about 0.028 mm. The eggs are reniform, measuring 0.12 by 0.05 mm and the first two instar larvae are vermiform. The second instar larvae are mobile in damp soil and search down {{to a depth of}} 30 centimetres for suitable roots to invade. Here they develop further and become sedentary, burying their heads in cells and feeding on the cell sap. The central part of their bodies swells, and after moulting they develop into bottle-shaped third instar larvae and after moulting again, lemon-shaped fourth instar larvae. The swollen larvae break out of the root cortex. At this stage they differentiate into males and females. The males become mobile and migrate through the soil searching for females with which to mate. The females remain attached to the root tissues by their heads, continue feeding and start laying eggs. These are held within the bodies of the females which later die and turn into brown cysts with hard cuticles. These eventually become detached from the roots. The eggs develop into larvae inside the cyst and some second instar larvae emerge into the soil to start a new cycle of development. Most of the larvae lie in a state of <b>anabiosis</b> within the cysts where they can remain dormant for several years and still be viable.|$|E

The omnipres-ence of H 2 in the biosphere since life began, its ability to penetrate the microbial cell, its low energy of activation, its ability to form protons and electrons {{in the presence of}} Fe(II), and its (including electrons and protons) role in many biochemical reactions make H 2 the best candidate as the energy of survival for microbial cells.

40|$|In {{the course}} of several years of use of {{lyophilization}} for long term preservation of oxytetracycline producing Streptomyces strains, their morphogenetic stability and the stability of their antibiotic yields were verified. The described process of lyophilization, as regards the viability and morphogenetic stability of both sporogenous and the asporogenous forms, has been proved very successful, with few exceptions. Data are given in Table II. Viable spore counts of 40 — 90. 8 % were satisfactory. The growth of lyophilized cultures on agar medium (P— 1) did not differ much from the growth of non-lyophilized (control) cultures: the populations of the cultures invariably retained all essential »starting« morphological characteristics. Only in a small number of cases alterations in some lyophilized cultures in comparison with the »starting« cultures were observed (e. g. T 6 — 429, T 6 — 483 and BIM— 197 in Table II). These differences were manifested by the appearance of small colonies (5 %), the disappearance of drops of exudate from the colonies center, or by differences in intensity of soluble pigment in the medium. No reliable explanation has been found for this phenomenon. It can probably be ascribed to microecological conditions (different composition of medium, temperature and the like). The growth of lyophilizates in a liquid medium (P— 2) owing to the almost complete <b>anabiosis,</b> was obviously somewhat slower (it averaged 10 — 16 hours) in comparison to the control cultures; the lyophilized asporogenous cultures, however, grew faster (4 — 6 hours) than the lyophilized sporogenous ones (see Table II). It has been proved that the remaining moisture in the lyophilizates is the limiting factor in attaining <b>anabiosis</b> and that, therefore, it is necessary to maintain the moisture within a narrow range and at a low level. The quality of cotton plugs considerably influences the process of lyophilization, especially at the stage of drying in the vacuum, so that full attention must be paid to the preparation of these plugs, particularly to their hardness. With regard to the stability in Oxytetracycline antibiotic yields (Table III), the tested lyophilizates have given different yields in comparison to the control cultures, in spite of the same testing conditions in {{the course of}} experiments, especially in the laboratory. Tests with some lyophilized cultures were repeated, and results obtained showed approximately the same differences (Table III, figures in brackets). The yields were often higher than those of the control. The obtained Oxytetracycline yields on a production scale were very favourable and uniform, even in the course of prolonged use of lyophilized cultures for the preparation of inoculum. The following conclusions are the result of many years of work and of data presented here: 1) The described process of lyophilization, as a whole, is suitable for a long term preservation of tested Oxytetracycline producing Streptomyces strains. 2) Both apparatuses used for lyophilization are suitable for the purpose described and produce lyophilizates of uniform quality. The model DELTA I/a is of higher capacity and therefore more suitable for production purposes, and for the maintaining of larger collections of cultures. 3) The optimum freezing temperature of the cultures is — 50 to — 55 °C. 4) The remainder of moisture in the lyophilizates — because it is a determinant factor in attaining <b>anabiosis</b> on which the stability of cultures depends — must be kept at the same, previously verified level. 5) Lyophilized cultures retained constant Oxytetracycline yields {{in the course of the}} four-year storage. 6) The porousness and the hardness of the microbiological cotton plugs must be standardized for the sake of more successful lyophilization process...|$|E

It is well substantiated to consider the Antarctic ice sheet and the Antarctic and Arctic permafrost as terrestrial analogues of Martian habitats. The results of our long-standing microbiological studies of the Antarctic ice would provide the basis for detection of viable microbial cells on Mars. Our microbiological investigations of the deepest and thus most ancient strata of the Antarctic ice sheet for the first time gave evidence for the natural phenomenon of long-term <b>anabiosis</b> (preservation of viability and vitality for millennia years).

40|$|Representatives of {{the resurrection}} plants from Gesneriaceae family are {{included}} in the Red Book of Bulgaria, in the European Register of rare, endangered, and endemic plants, and are subjects of world’s conventions on the preservation of the biodiversity. The unique feature of these plants to recover from prolonged dehydration (<b>anabiosis)</b> is explored in numerous studies.

40|$|Paleoendemic {{species of}} the {{monophyletic}} genus Ramonda (R. myconi, R. serbica and R. nathaliae) are {{the remnants of the}} Tertiary tropical and subtropical flora in Europe. They are the rare resurrection plants of Northern Hemisphere temperate zone. Ramonda serbica and R. nathaliae are chorologically differentiated in the Balkan Peninsula and occupy similar habitats in calcareous, northward slopes in canyons and mountainsides. They remain well-hydrated during spring, late autumn and even in winter. In summer and early autumn when plants are subjected to drought and thermal stress, their desiccation tolerance comes into operation and they fall into <b>anabiosis.</b> Investigations revealed the permanent presence of ubiquitine and its conjugates, high amounts of oxalic acid and proline. Both species are homoiochlorophyllous. It enables them to rapidly resume photosynthesis upon rehydration, but also makes them susceptible to ROS formation. Dehydration induces activation of antioxidative enzymes (APX, GR, PPO), increase in amounts of AsA and GSH, phenolic acids, dehydrins, sucrose and inorganic ions. Plasma membranes, characterized by high amount of cholesterol, are subjected to decrease in membrane fluidity mostly on account of increased level of lipid saturation. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that R. nathaliae is a diploid (2 n= 48) and probably evolutionary older species, while R. serbica is a hexaploid (2 n= 144). Two species live together in only two localities forming hybrid individuals (2 n= 96). Polyploidization is the major evolutionary mechanism in the genus Ramonda that together with hybridization ability indicates that these relict species which have preserved an ancient survival strategy are not the evolutionary „dead end.

40|$|Biological soil crusts (BSC) {{contribute}} significantly to the soil surface cover in many dryland ecosystems. A mixed type of BSC, which consists of cyanobacteria, mosses and cyanolichens, constitutes more than 60 % of ground cover in the semiarid grass-shrub steppe at Sayeret Shaked in the northern Negev Desert, Israel. This study aimed at parameterizing the carbon sink capacity of well-developed BSC in undisturbed steppe systems. Mobile enclosures on permanent soil borne collars were used to investigate BSC-related CO 2 fluxes in situ and with natural moisture supply during 10 two-day field campaigns within seven months from fall 2001 to summer 2002. Highest BSC-related CO 2 deposition between – 11. 31 and – 17. 56 mmol m − 2 per 15 h was found with BSC activated from rain and dew during {{the peak of the}} winter rain season. Net CO 2 deposition by BSC was calculated to compensate 120 %, – 26 %, and less than 3 % of the concurrent soil CO 2 efflux from November–January, February–May and November–May, respectively. Thus, BSC effectively compensated soil CO 2 effluxes when CO 2 uptake by vascular vegetation was probably at its low point. Nighttime respiratory emission reduced daily BSC-related CO 2 deposition within the period November–January by 11 – 123 % and on average by 27 %. The analysis of CO 2 fluxes and water inputs from the various sources showed that the bulk of BSC-related CO 2 deposition occurs during periods with frequent rain events and subsequent condensation from water accumulated in the upper soil layers. Significant BSC activity on days without detectable atmospheric water supply emphasized the importance of high soil moisture contents as additional water source for soil-dwelling BSC, whereas activity upon dew formation at low soil water contents was not of major importance for BSC-related CO 2 deposition. However, dew may still be important in attaining a pre-activated status during the transition from a long "summer" <b>anabiosis</b> towards the first winter rain...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms {{preserved}} {{within the}} permafrost, glaciers, and polar ice sheets of planet Earth provide analogs for microbial life forms {{that may be}} encountered in ice or permafrost of Mars, Europa, Callisto, Ganymede, asteroids, comets or other frozen worlds in the Cosmos. The psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microbes of the terrestrial cryosphere help establish the thermal and temporal limitations of life on Earth and provide clues to where and how we should search for evidence of life elsewhere in the Universe. For this reason, the cold-loving microorganisms are directly relevant to Astrobiology. Cryopreserved microorganisms can remain viable (in deep <b>anabiosis)</b> in permafrost and ice for millions of years. Permafrost, ice wedges, pingos, glaciers, and polar ice sheets may contain intact ancient DNA, lipids, enzymes, proteins, genes, and even frozen and yet viable ancient microbiota. Some microorganisms carry out metabolic processes in water films and brine, acidic, or alkaline channels in permafrost or ice at temperatures far below 0 C. Complex microbial communities live in snow, ice-bubbles, cryoconite holes on glaciers and ancient microbial ecosystems are cryopreserved within the permafrost, glaciers, and polar caps. In the Astrobiology group of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of Alabama at Huntsville, we have employed advanced techniques for the isolation, culture, and phylogenetic analysis of many types of microbial extremophiles. We have also used the Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope to study the morphology, ultra-microstructure and chemical composition of microorganisms in ancient permafrost and ice. We discuss several interesting and novel anaerobic microorganisms that we have isolated and cultured from the Pleistocene ice of the Fox Tunnel of Alaska, guano of the Magellanic Penguin, deep-sea sediments from {{the vicinity of the}} Rainbow Hydrothermal Vent and enrichment cultures from ice of the Patriot Hills of Antarctica.

40|$|Previous works {{suggested}} that Pleurostima purpurea (Velloziaceae-Barbacenioideae) shows a remarkable capacity to endure desiccation of its vegetative tissues. P. purpurea occurs in monocotyledons mats on soil {{islands in the}} Pao de Acucar (Sugar Loaf) {{one of the most}} recognizable rock outcrops of the world, in Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Mats of P. purpurea occur in cliffs by the sea some meters above the tidal zone. Although living in rock outcrops almost devoid of any soil cover, P. purpurea seems to occur preferably on less exposed rock faces and slightly shady sites. Usually, less extreme adaptations to drought would be expected in plants with the habitat preference of P. purpurea. Relying on this observation, we argue if a combination of different strategies of dealing with low water availability can be found in P. purpurea as on other desiccation tolerant angiosperms. This study aims to examine the occurrence of desiccation tolerant behavior in P. purpurea together with the expression of drought avoidance mechanisms during dehydration progression. For this, it was analyzed the gas exchanges, leaf pigments and relative leaf water content during desiccation and rehydration of cultivated mature individuals. P. purpurea behaved like typical drought avoiders under moderated drought condition with stomatal closure occurring around a relative leaf water content up to 90 %. During this process, it was observed a delay in the leaf relative water content (RWC(leaf)) decrease comparing to the plant-soil relative water content (RWC(plant-soil)). As soil dehydration worsened, gas exchanges restrictions progressed until a lack of activity which characterizes <b>anabiosis.</b> The loss of chlorophyll occurs before the end of total dehydration, characterizing the presence of poikilochlorophylly. The chlorophyll degradation follows the RWC(leaf) decrease, which achieved the minimum average value of 17 % without incurring in leaf abscission. The chlorophyll re-synthesis seems to start well after the full rehydration of the leaf. During all of this process, carotenoid content remained stable. These results are coherent with a combination of drought avoidance and desiccation tolerance in P. purpurea which seems to be coherent with the amplitude of water availability in the rock outcrop habitat where it occurs, suggesting that the periods of water availability are sufficiently long for the success of the costly desiccation tolerant behavior but too short to make a typical drought avoider species win the competition for exploring the rock outcrop substrate where P. purpurea occurs...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{isotopes}} compositions (a 14 C and δ 13 C) {{of freshwater}} submerged mosses and of {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) were measured in the karst region of Croatia - at the Plitvice Lakes and along the water path of the Zrmanja and Krupa rivers. The moss samples were identified and they all belong to the C 3 type plants regarding the photosynthesis pathway. The carbon isotope composition of mosses was {{compared to that of}} DIC and of atmospheric CO 2, i. e., carbon reservoirs from which mosses pull carbon for photosynthesis. The current measured values at the Plitvice Lakes region were compared to the values measured 30 years ago, when the a 14 C of the atmosphere was about 30 % higher than today (Srdoč et al. 1986; Marčenko et al. 1989). The share of atmospheric carbon to carbon from DIC incorporated in mosses (ωatm) was calculated. Most moss species had ωatm values between 0 % and 66 %. A good correlation found for δ 13 Cmoss vs. ωatm gives a potential of using fossil mosses found in inactive tufas in determination of age of tufa formation, which is important for reconstruction of rivers’ palaeoflow, palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment. However, two species of mosses (Cinclidotus aquaticus and Ptychostomum pseudotriquetrum) had a 14 C values bellow the a 14 CDIC which implied that they incorporated carbon only from DIC, i. e. that they turned to <b>anabiosis</b> during dry periods. Therefore, these moss species can be used as an indicator of an average a 14 C of DIC which is used to determine the initial activity of secondary carbonates (tufa and lake sediments) at the sampling sites. Values of a 14 CDIC for grab samples can have fluctuations depending on the water levels and are therefore not as reliable as the a 14 C values of composite samples such as the anabiotic moss species. From ωatm and δ 13 Cmoss values, the 13 C fractionation between DIC and organic tissue of a moss was calculated (εDIC-moss) and it ranged from - 50 ‰ to - 29 ‰ which was probably the result of moss adjustment to synthesize primarily atmospheric CO 2. For comparison, the 13 C fractionation between atmospheric CO 2 and organic tissue of a C 3 plant, εatm-plant is ~- 20 ‰. Correlation of εDIC-moss vs. ωatm showed the following pattern: 1) true aquatic moss species fractionated more if they contained more atmospheric C, and 2) moss species growing on wet rock fractionated more when they grew in higher water flows.
