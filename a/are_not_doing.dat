5|$|Aquaria was {{developed}} by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka {{over the course of}} two years, off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including I'm O.K with Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival. The name of the studio is intended to represent a fusion of art and technology. Aquaria is the studio's only game. Both members of the team continue to make video games, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> so as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of Spelunky.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} {{potential}} for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online “e-tailer” or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site’s servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these “e-tailers” <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer’s data. However, with this being said, most “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information’s abuse can be tracked back to the site’s servers.|$|E

He called for the formation of permanent race stewards, instead of the temporary steward system currently in place. He called it [...] "the worst judgement in the history of F1", saying, [...] "It's absolutely unacceptable when three influence the championship like this". Three-time {{world champion}} Jackie Stewart said that [...] "F1 attracts the largest capital investment in sport, but it's being overseen by people who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> it full-time and we get inconsistent decisions".|$|E
500|$|We {{too often}} forget the {{humanity}} of doctors and nurses. They become godlike {{to most of us}} and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable.

That is why Noland will dream up a baby derby, a gambling night at the hospital, a variety show at Christmas and off-track betting when patients get bored with the hospital routine.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> that. When you look at their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E

Saran has said [...] "When I studied in DPS Mathura Road in Delhi, there was a school for blind exactly opposite to our school. I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what inspired {{me to do something}} for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's important to understand that you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E
500|$|Slow {{progress}} {{has led to}} frustration, expressed by {{the executive director of}} the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: [...] "we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> it." [...] Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government, although adherence is often sketchy. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations. The government of Brazil provides universal TB-care, which reduces this problem. Conversely, falling rates of TB-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to increased level of education, income, and health of the population. Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in [...] "high burden" [...] countries. Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250M rural migrants in China.|$|E
500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

2500|$|While {{full-time}} work hinders schooling, {{empirical evidence}} is varied {{on the relationship}} between part-time work and school. [...] Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance. [...] On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home. [...] In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children, often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood.|$|E

The mishap which destroyed the May-fly, or the Won't Fly, {{as it would be}} more accurate to call it, at Barrow, was a very serious set-back to the development of Admiralty policy in airships." [...] And on 31 March 1913 Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell (who would himself later become First Lord of the Admiralty) made the following comment regarding the fate of Mayfly and the lack of British airships: [...] "The 'May-fly' broke three years ago, and nothing further has been done.
