40|$|In partial {{fulfilment}} of the National Diploma in Horticulture of the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> as nitrogenous fertilisers, with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These nitrogenous fertilisers, with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. Anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in nitrogenous fertilisers and usage of the various forms, particularly anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Also dealt with is the history of nitrogenous fertilisers. Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas. Part III deals with the position in New Zealand. The types of nitrogen fertilisers used and the economic aspects of their usage. Prospects for anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> in New Zealand are looked at. In conclusion the general findings are summarised and recommendations are made with a view to future needs in New Zealand for anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia.</b> This thesis attempts to tentatively answer the question, "Is there a place for anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> fertiliser in New Zealand, and what action should be taken to examine this subject more closely"...|$|R

The current dual effect VAR system has two generators, {{to meet the}} choice of only power/only cooling/both power and cooling. The strong refrigerant solution (<b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia)</b> from the absorber is divided in to two streams and one flows to the first generator and heats by solar thermal heat, then turbine. This produces the maximum power to the maximum vapour <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> as inlet to the turbine and these changes with temperature and pressure and made the cooler effect at exit of turbine. The balance mass goes to the second generator for refrigeration and it is single effect refrigeration. Thus the system cooling and power have been integrated to get two benefits from a single system...|$|R

40|$|M. Eng. The {{need and}} problem was {{originated}} from the trends of the earths dwindling energy resource. As time progresses humans {{are becoming more}} aware of need to use so called “alternative energy sources” to alleviate the main energy converters i. e. power stations. The student was tasked with investigating the thermal performance of a solar powered refrigeration cycle (prototype) that could: produce enough refrigeration effect that it replaces the standard home vapour compression unit, used for cooling or freezing of foods, heats up a geyser sufficiently to have hot water for a common house hold, has excess energy to heat or cool liquid or air based environments and {{has the potential to}} lower the electrical bill of a house. The introductory step was to obtain the thermo fluid properties of <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> solutions. A setback came about when determining the <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> properties. There were too many conflicting properties being yielded by six different authors. In an attempt to gain confidence in only one author a comparison table was prepared. The table compared the six authors to each other. By looking at all the values compared it brought great clarity to the problem. When continuing the research into the fundamental law approach of solving for the cycle new findings were made. Initially very little comprehensive studies were done which explained in fundamental laws to solve for the absorption cycle. After extensive reviewing of a detailed study on how to solve for absorption refrigeration cycles, then it was able to begin improving on the thermo – fluid design of the cycle. As cycle and component design began to progress the train of thought began to steer in a direction. Each component needed to be detail designed. The advantage of having each component specifically catered for in the cycle design was that it would increase the cycle efficiency. In this way it would ensure that during the concept generation phase the functioning of each component was clear, thereby enabling a clear understanding of how components would compliment each other in a cycle. A mode of solving for the cycle was to endeavour that all parameters could be calculated unambiguously, with the aid of computerisation. Testing was carried out on a real life commercial thermal siphoning machine in order to realistically understand how absorption refrigeration works and gain experience. At {{the end of the study}} the most important result is that the dissertation research shows strong evidence that it will be possible to create a device which can fulfil the four tasks listed above. Another result is a program which is a refined cycle design of the pump absorption type refrigeration. The program solves for points along the cycle. Lastly it was found that even though EES was the simpler program to use for <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> solution properties it was the only program which catered for sub cooling and super heating...|$|R

40|$|Many tons of crop {{residues}} and other low-quality forages are produced in Kansas each year. Use of these forages often {{is limited by}} their low nutrient content and poor digestibility. The process of applying anhydrous ammonia to low-quality forages enhances their feeding value by increasing crude protein content and dry matter digestibility.

In an effort to aid livestock producers, the K-State Beef Extension Specialist Team, in conjunction with the Livestock Production Program Focus Team, conducted wheat straw ammoniation demonstrations at 6 locations across Kansas.

This amount {{is similar to}} that used about 10 years earlier when 170, 000 tons of N was used in 1984. However, a substantial materials shift has occurred since 1984 when about 56 % of the N used as the major three sources was urea or N solutions. The percentage of urea-containing materials has increased to 80 % in 1999 and 76 % in 2000. This increased utilization of urea-containing fertilizers parallels the national trend and emphasizes the need to manage urea effectively. The increased utilization of urea-containing fertilizers in Wisconsin has occurred largely at the expense of anhydrous ammonia which has experienced a reduced market share from about 44 % of the N in 1984 to 20 to 25 % of the three major N sources at present.

Experiments were conducted at two sites from 2003 through 2007 for the spring-applied ESN/urea study, two sites from 2006 through 2007 for the fall and spring-applied ESN/AA study, and one site from 2006 through 2007 for the spring applied ESN/AA study. N rates in the studies were 0 - 202 kg ha- 1 in 34 kg N ha- 1 increments in the ESN/urea study and 0 - 202 kg N ha- 1 in 67 kg N ha- 1 increments in the fall and spring-applied ESN/AA studies. Four of nine site-years in the ESN/urea study had significantly higher corn grain yields due to ESN. One of four site-years in the fall and spring-applied study had higher grain yields to either fall or spring application of ESN. Neither year of the spring-applied ESN/AA study had significantly higher grain yields due to ESN.

40|$|Chemical and {{biological}} interactions between soil N and alkaline-hydrolysing N fertilizers were studied in laboratory and glasshouse experiments. Chemical interactions were measured in y-irradiated soils, {{and biological}} interactions in non-irradiated or reinoculated y-irradiated samples incubated with 15 N-labelled urea, <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> or di-ammonium phosphate. The roles of NH 3 fixation by soil organic matter, chemical hydrolysis and dissolution of soil organic N and transformations of solubilized organic N in influencing {{the availability of}} soil N were evaluated in laboratory experiments. The interaction between foliar application of urea and the uptake of soil N by wheat and sunflower was studied in a glasshouse experiment. Recovery of fertilizer N in the organic fraction of y-irradiated soils {{was due to the}} process of NH 3 fixation. NH 3 fixation varied among soils, and up to 4. 6 % of <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> added at 1000 mg N kg- 1 soil was fixed by soil organic matter at day 7. The amount of NH 3 fixed increased with increasing rates of NH 3 (aq) and urea application. More than 55 % of the total NH 3 fixation measured 28 days after application of 2000 mg urea-N kg- 1 soil occurred in the first week. Soil pH and NH 3 fixation varied in response to N source, and increased in the order of di-ammonium phosphate urea > di-ammonium phosphate > ammonium sulphate at equivalent N concentration. Recovery of fertilizer N in the organic fraction of biologically-active soil was higher than y-irradiated soil due to immobilization. Biological immobilization of labelled N was similar for urea and diammonium phosphate applications, and increased slightly with increasing N application rate or incubation time. Positive added nitrogen interactions were observed in both y-irradiated and biologically-active samples. The ANI in the biologically active soil was greater compared to sterile soil, and both increased with rate of fertilizer application and time of incubation. When added nitrogen interactions due to chemical processes and pool substitution were taken into account, a real positive ANI due to biological factors (ANI (rb)) was measured in three soils. The ANI (rb) increased with rate of fertilizer application. This increase, together with increased immobilization and a measured decrease in fertilizer-induced soluble organic N during incubation, indicated that biological activity was enhanced through increased availability of substrate. The biological availability of organic N solubilized by NH 3 (aq) was determined in incubation experiments using 15 N-labelled and unlabelled substrates. The activity of heterotrophic microorganisms increased in response to the addition of unlabelled soluble organic N, as seen by higher gross rates of N mineralization and immobilization between day 0 and 7. However, the measured response of net mineralization was significant only when the rate of organic N addition exceeded 100 mg N kg- 1 soil, or the rate of NH 3 (aq) addition was equal to or greater than 1500 mg N kg- 1 soil. A constant proportion of approximately one-quarter of the labelled organic N added at different rates was recovered in the mineral N pool at day 14. Availability ratios calculated from net mineralization data indicated that fertilizer-induced solubilization of organic N increased its mineralization potential, and provided an explanation for the real added nitrogen interaction due to biological factors observed in N fertilized soil. The interaction between foliar application of urea to wheat and sunflower plants and the pool of available soil N accessible to plant roots was investigated in a glasshouse experiment using two soils of low and moderate N status. Fertilizer absorption was dependent on the sink size of the plant, and increased curvilinearly with the number of fertilizer applications. Dry matter production and its partitioning between tops and roots varied between soils and plants, and there was a significant soil-plant interaction. Plants grown in the N-deficient soil responded to urea application, and significant correlations between root dry matter or soil N uptake and plant N derived from fertilizer were obtained. A negative added nitrogen interaction observed for wheat sampled at day 33 in the N-deficient soil was due to less root growth as N derived from fertilizer increased. However, soil N uptake was higher in fertilized compared to unfertilized plants at 54 days after sowing due to bigger and more efficient root systems. i. e. there was a real positive added nitrogen interaction.

While there are studies that show the efficacy of utilizing ammoniated wheat straw in beef cow and maintenance diets, limited data are available characterizing the feeding value of ammoniated wheat straw in receiving and growing diets. The objective of these two studies were to evaluate cattle growth and diet digestibility for receiving and growing diets containing either wheat straw (STRW), anhydrous ammonia treated wheat straw (AMMN), or a prairie hay and alfalfa blend (CONT) at 30 % inclusion. Exp. 1 utilized 288 crossbred steers (271 kg) randomized to 8 pens per treatment and fed their respective test diets for 56 d and a common diet for 14 d to equalize gastrointestinal tract fill. No effect of straw ammoniation was observed on final bodyweight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), dry matter intake (DMI), or gain to feed (G:F) (P > 0. 31). The 56 -d BW, ADG, and G:F for CONT were significantly different from both STRW and AMMN (P 0. 57) although CONT differed significantly from both straw treatments in DM, OM, and ADF intake (P 0. 43), where as CONT and STRW were different (P 0. 32). Ruminal pH was not affected by anhydrous <b>ammonia</b> <b>application</b> (P = 0. 32), but STRW and CONT were different (P < 0. 05). Fluid passage rate was not different among the three treatments (P = 0. 33). Wheat straw is a suitable replacement for ammoniated wheat straw at 30 % inclusion in receiving and growing diets that contain 40 % of dietary DM as wet corn gluten feed. Further research is necessary to determine the effect of varying levels of wheat straw and ammoniated wheat straw in conjunction with wet corn gluten feed and other by-product feeds in receiving and growing diets in order to capitalize on performance and efficiency gains while constraining costs...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{livestock}} production {{is connected with}} a number of environmental effects, including discharges to soils and surface waters and emissions to the atmosphere. In areas with a high livestock density the low availability of nearby arable land, together with the preferred use of chemical fertilizer by arable farmers, results in high off-farm disposal costs for manure. Furthermore, ammonia abatement technologies, such as treatment of exhaust air, are important as ammonia emissions may account up to a quarter of the total nitrogen flux. Firstly, the paper describes and discusses the development of manure treatment in the Netherlands since the 1970 ¿s. Manure treatment processes that result in products that compete with and replace the use of chemical fertilizers can (partly) close the nutrient cycle again. From this point of view aerobic treatment of manure (nitrification/denitrification) can not be considered sustainable as nitrogen is taken out of the cycle at high environmental costs. Secondly, the state-of-the-art of techniques for treatment of exhaust air is presented. Besides <b>ammonia,</b> <b>application</b> of air treatment may also reduce environmental emissions of odour and particulate matter (dust). Both manure treatment and treatment of exhaust air are considered essential for sustainable livestock operations in areas with a high livestock density...|$|R
