Aim: To present the challenges and solutions to inform students how to derive the greatest benefit from the learning activities in their SSC programmes. Methods: Synthesis of the accumulated experience over more than 10 years of developing, running and evaluating SSCs by the Directors of SSCs in five Scottish Medical Schools, combined with analysis of course evaluation and student feedback. Results: Consensus defined 12 tips aimed at improving the approach taken by students to their SSCs, and to provide a structure to maximise their final learning outcomes. Conclusion: SSC programmes provide diverse opportunities for students to develop and expand their learning. With increasing emphasis being placed upon student assessment to judge a wide range of professional skills and standards into foundation and specialist training, much greater importance is now being given to SSCs as an opportunity for personal, professional and academic developments.

40|$|The {{strengths}} of magnetic fields in interstellar gas clouds are obtained through {{observations of the}} circular polarization of spectral line radiation. Irregularities in this magnetic field may be present due to turbulence, waves or perhaps other causes, and may play {{an essential role in}} the structure and evolution of the gas clouds. To infer information about these irregularities from the observational data, we develop statistical relationships between the rms values of the irregular component of the magnetic field and spatial variations in the circular polarization of the spectral line radiation. The irregularities are characterized in analogy with descriptions of turbulence [...] -by a sum of Fourier waves having a power spectrum with a slope similar to that of Kolmogorov turbulence. For comparison, we also perform computations in which turbulent magnetic and velocity fields from representative MHD simulations by others are utilized. Although the effects of the variations about the mean value of the magnetic field along the path of a ray tend to cancel, a significant residual effect in the polarization of the emergent radiation remains for typical values of the relevant parameters. A map of observed spectra of the 21 cm line toward Orion A is analyzed and the results are compared with our calculations in order to infer the strength of the irregular component of the magnetic field. The rms of the irregular component is found to be comparable in magnitude to the mean magnetic field within the cloud.

These {{were used to}} predict and compare, first, performance of cows under nine crossbreeding strategies and, second, {{the performance of the}} production systems when applying the strategies that included maintaining the purebred S dams and bulls required for the production of crossbreds. Performance was predicted from parameters of a genetic model based on additive-dominance and additive X additive interaction effects for the following strategies: first cross (F X S), two-breed rotation (AS) Rot, three-breed rotation (BFS) Rot and two- (F and S), three- (B, F and S) and four- (A, B, F and S) breed synthetic (syn) breeds based on equal and unequal contributions of the foundation breeds. The sensitivity of predicted performance at the cow level to variation in economic parameters was also investigated. For profit per day of productive herdlife (PLD), the B and F additive breed effects were not significantly different from that of A. The additive breed effect for S was negative and significant (P<-. 01) indicating that it was inferior to the Bos taurus for PLD. Dominance effects for PLD in the crosses A X S and B X S were positive and significant (P< 0. 05). The additive X additive interactions were negative and significant in all the crosses. At the individual cow level, predicted PLD would be lowest in (ABFS) syn and highest in F X S. the (3 / 4 F 1 / 4 S) syn would be the second-best strategy giving 90 percent of the expected F X S profit, while (FS) syn would give 87 percent. At production system level, systems based on F X S cows were superior to those based on the rotations at all level of number of calvings (NL) and would be superior to those based on the two-breed synthetics only at a NL higher than 4. Variation of costs and prices greatly affected predicted economic benefit but not the ranking of strategies. The absence of significant differences in the additive breed effects of the B. taurus breeds for PLD showed that comparable economic benefits were derived by use of any of the three breeds for continuous crossbreeding with the S in a production system with management achieving 3000 kg lactation yields.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first attempt in Greece to {{identify}} the prevalence and the incidence rates of amputations in diabetic patients performed in a certain area (Hmathia prefecture), during a decade (1990 - 99). Amputation in diabetic patients is a macrovascular complication of diabetes, although, in addition to peripheral vascular disease, diabetic neuropathy, a microvascular complication, {{is involved in the}} aetiopathogenesis of diabetic ulcer. Insulin, hyperglycaemia, impaired hemostatis and lipids are correlated with the aetiopathogenesis of macrovascular complications of diabetes. Individuals with diabetes are predisposed to a diabetic ulcer primarily {{because of the presence of}} peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease, but other factors contribute too. Programs aiming to reduce amputations among people with diabetes should provide patient education and foot-care programs. Summarizing our findings, the 84 diabetic amputees in Hmathia region during 1990 - 99, have undergone 101 amputations totally, (approximately 70 % of all amputations). The prevalence of diabetic amputees in prefecture of Hmathia in 1999 was found 12, 5 / 1000 diabetic patients (1, 25 %) and 2, 48 / 10000 population. The mean incidence of diabetic amputations during 1990 - 99 was found 3, 7 / 1000 diabetic patients/year and 0, 59 / 10000 total population/year. Most of the amputees were men and they had a high mortality rate (56 %), almost 3 -fold higher comparing with the rest diabetic population. High amputations of tibia and thigh were found in higher percentage than the usual reported in international reports. The survivors were, in their majority, people of low educational state, mainly farmers, smokers at the time of examination or in the past. The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years, their glycaemic control was not good, while their lipid profile was not bad and 1 / 3 of them reported a history of angina or heart infraction. Micro- or macroalbuminuria was found in most of the examined patients and impaired renal functure in half of them. In spite of this, only 18 % of patients reported albuminuria, and this fact possibly reflects the absence of frequent medical attendance. A small percentage of them reported Laser therapy, obviously because they rarely visited an occulist. Symptoms of peripheral vascular disease from the other limb, were present in 56 % of the patients, and in most of them an impaired ankle-brachial index (ABI) was observed. Peripheral sensory neuropathy was detected in 41 % of the patients. Despite the fact that prevalence and incidence of diabetic amputations in the certain population is not higher than the prevalence and incidence rates in intenational reports, the younger age of first amputation, the higher percentage of mortality, the smoking habits, the high percentage of above knee amputations and the high percentage of microvascular and macrovascular complications in the population of amputees, who were at low educational and social level, should alarm government and primary health services to pay attention on the matter of prediction and education in the diabetic population. The diabetic amputee living in Hmathia prefecture could represent the typical Greek diabetic patient, who has undergone one or more amputation: he is at low educational and social level, he is insufficiently medical attended and he almost totally ignores the risks of his disease. He doesn’t know the importance of good glycaemic control, the risks from smoking, especially in relation with his disease, he ignores the risks of diabetic foot or the ways of protection, he doesn’t visit an occulist Doctors of primary health need more awareness and education on the diabetic foot matter. Medical attendace of diabetic patients must be more intensive and frequent, targeting to a reduction of diabetic amputation rates. We are not able to know if the goals of St Vincent’s declaration have been achieved in Greece, as far as this is the first evaluation of prevalence and incidence of amputations in diabetic patients, but this study could be the beginning of other population studies and could be <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>comparable</b> with a future one in the same region during next decade, so that we will be able to identify the possible and wanted reduction of amputations in diabetic patients. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study {{multicomponent}} diffusion in liquids using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Diffusion {{plays an important role}} in mass transport processes. In binary systems, mass transfer processes have been studied extensively using both experiments and molecular simulations. From a practical point of view, systems consisting more than two components are more interesting. However, experimental and simulation data on transport diffusion for such systems are scarce. Therefore, a more detailed knowledge on mass transfer in multicomponent systems is required. The presence of multiple components in a system introduces difficulties in studying diffusion in experiments. Investigating the concentration dependence of diffusion coefficients seriously increases the required experimental effort. In this thesis, we will use MD simulation based on classical force fields to study multicomponent diffusion in liquids. Diffusion can be described using both Fick and Maxwell- Stefan (MS) diffusion coefficients. Experiments provide Fick diffusion coefficients while simulations usually provide MS diffusion coefficients. Fick and MS diffusivities are related via the matrix of thermodynamic factors. A brief survey on methods for studying liquid diffusion and their limitations is presented in chapter 1 In chapter 2, we study the diffusion in the ternary system n-hexane-cyclohexanetoluene. The existing models for predicting MS diffusivities at finite concentrations (i:e: the Vignes equation) as well as the predictions at infinite dilution (i:e: predictions of Ðxk! 1 i j using the so-called WK, KT, VKB, DKB and RS models) are tested using MD simulations. We find that (1) the Vignes equation only results in reasonable predictions for MS diffusivities yielding differences of 13 % compared to the actual diffusion coefficients; (2) the best predictive model (the KT model) for calculating MS diffusivities at infinite dilution results in differences of 8 % compared to the actual diffusion coefficients. It is important to note that the differences of 8 % can be a coincidence since KT model is empirical and does not have a theoretical basis. This limitation makes KT model unreliable for other systems. To overcome the difficulties in predicting ternary MS diffusivities at infinite dilution (i:e: Ðxk! 1 i j), we derive the so-called LBV model based on the Onsager relations. MS diffusivities at infinite dilution can be expressed in terms of binary and pure component self-diffusivities and integrals over velocity cross-correlation functions. By neglecting the latter terms, we obtain the LBV model. In chapter 3, the LBV model is validated for WCA fluids and the ternary systems n-hexane-cyclohexane-toluene and methanol-ethanol-water. We find that: (1) for ideal mixtures i:e: the WCA system, as well as the n-hexane-cyclohexane-toluene system, the LBV model is accurate and superior compared to the existing models for predicting ternary MS diffusivities at infinite dilution (i:e: the WK, KT, VKB, DKB and RS models); (2) in mixtures containing associating components, i:e: the ethanol-methanol-water system, the LBV model indicates that in this system the integrals over velocity cross-correlation functions are important and cannot be neglected. Moreover, the LBV model provides an explanation why the MS diffusivity describing the friction between adsorbed components in a porous material is usually very large. In chapter 4, we focus on describing the values of MS diffusivities at finite concentration. A multicomponent Darken model for describing the concentration dependence of MS diffusivities is derived from linear response theory and the Onsager relations. In addition, a predictive model for the required self-diffusivities in the mixture is proposed leading to the so-called predictive Darken-LBV model. We compare our novel models to the existing generalized Vignes equation and the generalized Darken equation. Two systems are considered: (1) ternary and quaternary WCA systems; (2) the ternary system n-hexane-cyclohexane-toluene. Our results show that in all studied systems, our predictive Darken-LBV equation describes the concentration dependence better than the existing models. The physically-based Darken-LBV model provides a sound and robust framework for prediction of MS diffusion coefficients in multicomponent mixtures. In chapter 5, diffusion in more complex ionic liquid (IL) systems are investigated. Previous research reported in literature has largely focused on self-diffusion in ILs. For practical applications, mutual (transport) diffusion is by far more important than self-diffusion. We compute the MS diffusivities in binary systems containing 1 -alkyl- 3 - methylimidazolium chloride (CnmimCl), water and/or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The dependence of MS diffusivities on mixture composition are investigated. Our results show that: (1) For solutions of ILs in water and DMSO, self-diffusivities decrease strongly with increasing IL concentration. For the system DMSO-IL, an exponential decay is observed for this; (2) For both water-IL and DMSO-IL, MS diffusivities vary by a factor of 10 within the concentration range which is still significantly smaller than the variation of the self diffusivities; (3) The MS diffusivities of the investigated IL are almost independent of the alkyl chain length; (4) ILs stay in a form of isolated ions in CnmimCl-H 2 O mixtures, however, dissociation into ions is much less observed in CnmimCl-DMSO systems. This has a large effect on the concentration dependence of MS diffusivities; (5) The LBV model for predicting the MS diffusivity at infinite dilution described in chapter 3 suggests that velocity cross-correlation functions in ionic liquids cannot be neglected and that the dissociation of ILs into ion pairs has a very strong influence on diffusion. In experiments, Fick diffusion coefficients are measured and molecular simulation usually provides MS diffusivities. These approaches are related via the matrix of thermodynamic factors which is usually known only with large uncertainties. This leaves a gap between theory and application. In chapter 6, we introduce a consistent and efficient framework for the determination of Fick diffusivities in liquid mixtures directly from equilibrium MD simulations by calculating both the thermodynamic factor and the MS diffusivity. This provides the missing step to extract Fick diffusion coefficients directly from equilibrium MD simulations. The computed Fick diffusivities of acetone-methanol and acetone-tetrachloromethane mixtures are in excellent agreement with experimental values. The suggested framework thus provides an efficient route to model diffusion in liquids based on a consistent molecular picture. In chapter 7, we validate our method for computing Fick diffusivities using equilibrium MD simulations for the ternary system chloroform - acetone - methanol. Even though a simple molecular model is used (i:e: rigid molecules that interact by Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions), the computed thermodynamic factors are in close agreement with experiments. Validation data for diffusion coefficients is only available for two binary sub-systems. In these binary systems, MD results and experiments do agree well. For the ternary system, the computed thermodynamic factors using Molecular Dynamics simulation are in excellent agreement with experimental data and better than the ones obtained from COSMO-SAC calculations. Therefore, we expect that the computed Fick diffusivities should <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>comparable</b> with experiments. Our results suggest that the presented approach allows for an efficient and consistent prediction of multicomponent Fick diffusion coefficients from MD simulations. Now, a tool for guiding experiments and interpreting multicomponent mass transfer is available. Process & EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
