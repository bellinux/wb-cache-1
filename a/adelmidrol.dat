It classed as an ALIAmide, and is similar to palmitoylethanolamide, the parent molecule in the ALIAmide class of drugs. ALIAmides are group of fatty acid derivatives with cannabimimetic properties, which have antiinflammatory and analgesic effects and are thought to act by reducing mast cell activation.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{pain and}} neuropathic pain are {{indications}} {{for which there}} is high unmet need in the clinic. PEA has been tested in a variety of animal models for chronic and neuropathic pain. As cannabinoids, such as THC, have been proven to be effective in neuropathic pain states. The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of PEA in two models of acute and persistent pain seemed to be explained at least partly via the de novo neurosteroid synthesis. In chronic granulomatous pain and inflammation model, PEA could prevent nerve formation and sprouting, mechanical allodynia, and PEA inhibited dorsal root ganglia activation, which is a hallmark for winding up in neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of PEA as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory molecule is probably based on different aspects. PEA inhibits the release of both preformed and newly synthesised mast cell mediators, such as histamine and TNF-alpha. PEA, as well as its analogue <b>adelmidrol</b> (di-amide derivative of azelaic acid), can both down-regulate mast cells. PEA reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prevents IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the latter related to PEA as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist.In 2012 it became clear that PEA can also reduce reperfusion injury and the negative impact of shock on various outcome parameters, such as renal dysfunction, ischemic injury and inflammation, most probably via the PPAR-alpha pathway. Among the reperfusion and inflammation markers measured PEA could reduce the increase in creatinine, γGT, AST, nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; kidney MPO activity and MDA levels, nitrotyrosine, PAR and adhesion molecules expression, the infiltration and activation of mastcells and apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Adelmidrol</b> is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of azelaic acid and analogue of the anti-inflammatory compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). Based upon its physicochemical properties, <b>adelmidrol</b> {{is suitable for}} topical application. The main objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a topical <b>adelmidrol</b> emulsion on early and late inflammatory responses in hypersensitive dogs. Repeated intradermal injections of Ascaris suum extract were performed in both lateral thoracic areas of six conscious hypersensitive Beagle dogs, topically treated during 8 consecutive days. <b>Adelmidrol</b> (2 %) was applied to one side and vehicle to the other. 24 hours after the last antigen challenge, two biopsies (adelmidrol- and vehicle-treated side) were obtained for each dog at the antigen injection site. Results A significant reduction in the antigen-induced wheal areas was observed on the 4 th and 7 th day of <b>adelmidrol</b> treatment. Moreover, cutaneous mast cell numbers were significantly decreased in biopsies obtained after 8 consecutive days of topical <b>adelmidrol</b> treatment. Conclusions The results obtained in the present study show that topical treatment with <b>adelmidrol</b> might represent a new therapeutic tool in controlling the early and late allergic inflammatory skin responses in companion animals. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} {{produced by a}} cascade of events that can ultimately lead to joint damage. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>adelmidrol,</b> a synthetic palmitoylethanolamide analogue, combined with hyaluronic acid on pain severity and modulation of the inflammatory response in a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) -induced osteoarthritis. Methods: OA was induced by intra-articular injection of MIA in the knee joint. On day 21 post-MIA administration, the knee joint was analyzed. Rats subjected to OA were treated by intra-articular injection of <b>adelmidrol</b> in combination with sodium hyaluronate at different doses and time points after MIA induction. Limb nociception was assessed by the paw withdrawal latency and threshold measurement. Samples were examined macroscopically, histologically, and by immunohistochemistry. Results: At day 21 post-MIA injection, the MIA + solvent and MIA + 1. 0 % sodium hyaluronate groups showed irregularities and fibrillation in the surface layer, a decrease in blood cells and multilayering in transition and radial zones, no pannus formation, and modified Mankin scores significantly higher than sham knees. The combination of hyaluronic acid and <b>adelmidrol</b> dose-dependently (<b>adelmidrol</b> 0. 6 % + 1. 0 % sodium hyaluronate and <b>adelmidrol</b> 2 % + 1. 0 % sodium hyaluronate) reduced the histological alterations induced by MIA. Moreover, degeneration of articular cartilage, mast cell infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine plasma levels were significantly downregulated by treatment with a combination of hyaluronic acid and <b>adelmidrol</b> at the above doses. Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that the combination of hyaluronic acid and <b>adelmidrol</b> improves the signs of OA induced by MIA...|$|E
40|$|Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) {{and some}} of its analogues have shown great {{efficacy}} in the treatment of pain and inflammation. <b>Adelmidrol</b> - the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the di-amide derivative of azelaic acid - is one of these analogues. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of PEA and <b>adelmidrol</b> are hypothesized to be mediated, at least in part, by mast cell down-modulation. Mast cell mediators released at early stage of the inflammatory process drive the inflammatory reaction to chronicity as it happens in lambda-carrageenin-induced granulomatous tissue formation. In the present study, the choice of testing <b>adelmidrol</b> depends upon the physicochemical properties of the compound, i. e. the amphipatic feature, that make it more easily soluble than PEA. In this study, we investigated the effect of <b>adelmidrol</b> on granuloma formation induced by lambda-carrageenin-soaked sponge implant in rats. Our results show that the local administration of the compound under study significantly decreases weight and neo-angiogenesis in granulomatous tissue. The anti-inflammatory effect was due to the modulation of mast cells degranulation, as shown by histological analysis and by the inhibition of the release of several pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic enzymes (e. g. iNOS, chymase and metalloproteinase MMP- 9), and mediators (e. g. nitric oxide and TNF-alpha). The results indicate that <b>adelmidrol,</b> given locally, may represent a potential therapeutic tool in controlling chronic inflammation...|$|E
