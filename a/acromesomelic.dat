40|$|Natriuretic {{peptides}} are {{a family}} of structurally related but genetically distinct hormones/paracrine factors that regulate blood volume, blood pressure, ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, fat metabolism, and long bone growth. The mammalian members are atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide, and possibly osteocrin/musclin. Three single membrane-spanning natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) have been identified. Two, NPR-A/GC-A/NPR 1 and NPR-B/GC-B/NPR 2, are transmembrane guanylyl cyclases, enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of cGMP. One, NPR-C/NPR 3, lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity and controls the local concentrations of natriuretic peptides through constitutive receptor-mediated internalization and degradation. Single allele-inactivating mutations in the promoter of human NPR-A are associated with hypertension and heart failure, whereas homozygous inactivating mutations in human NPR-B cause a form of short-limbed dwarfism known as <b>acromesomelic</b> dysplasia type Maroteaux. The physiological effects of natriuretic peptides are elicited through three classes of cGMP binding proteins: cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels.

The biological actions of NPs are mediated by natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) A, B and C that are located on the cell surface. Mutations in NPR-B have been shown to cause <b>acromesomelic</b> dysplasia-type Maroteaux (AMDM), a growth disorder in humans and severe dwarfism in mice. We hypothesized that missense mutations of NPR-B associated with AMDM primarily affect NPR-B function by the arrest of receptor trafficking at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), due to conformational change, rather than an impairment of ligand binding, transmission of signal through the membrane or catalytic activity. Twelve missense mutations found in AMDM patients and cn/cn mice were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that 11 out of 12 mutants were retained in the ER. Determination of the ligand-dependent cGMP response confirmed that ER-retained NPR-B mutants are non-functional. Meanwhile, the only cell surface-targeted NPR-B missense mutant (D 176 E) displayed greatly reduced enzymatic activity due to impaired ligand binding.

Affected individuals were homozygous for a missense mutation, T 1322 C, in the coding region of the CDMP 1 gene. This mutation was not found in 44 control subjects of Pakistani origin. The T 1322 C change predicts a leu 441 pro substitution in the mature domain of the CDMP 1 protein.

40|$|High-throughput {{genotyping}} and sequencing {{technologies have}} stimulated an accelerated pace of Mendelian gene discovery. Forty-one novel genetic causes of skeletal dysplasia have been uncovered {{in the last}} two years. The genetic heterogeneity of the skeletal dysplasias is extremely high, with 450 forms described. Multiple organ systems can be affected, including the reproductive system. I present the discovery of two different genes that are mutated in spontaneously occurring mouse mutants that cause skeletal dysplasia and infertility. These discoveries demonstrate the value of mouse mutations for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing treatments. The peewee mouse exhibits female infertility and skeletal dysplasia associated with reduced progression of cells through the zones of the growth plate. The phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the gene that encodes natriuretic peptide receptor 2, Npr 2. Human NPR 2 mutations cause a form of extreme short stature known as <b>acromesomelic</b> dysplasia, Maroteaux type (AMDM). Nothing is known about the fertility of these patients. We demonstrate that Npr 2 loss-of-function affects growth by increased activation of the ERK MAPK pathway. We can correct the Npr 2 pwe/pwe growth defect in explant cultures of embryonic bones with drugs that inhibit MEK 1 / 2 action. We also show that female infertility is rooted in the requirement for Npr 2 activation to generate the cGMP necessary to maintain meiotic arrest of oocytes. The chagun mouse exhibits severe short stature and male infertility. The phenotype is caused by a hypomorphic mutation in a gene also mutated in human patients with a form of primordial dwarfism. The fertility of these patients is unknown. I demonstrate that chagun serves as a model for this human disorder. I show that the growth insufficiency is caused by disorganization of the cells at the growth plate, and that male infertility is due to progressive germ cell loss. Both of these mouse mutations model human skeletal dysplasia disorders, predict infertility, illuminate the pathophysiology of the disorders and pave the way for the development of therapeutic interventions to improve growth...|$|E

R 399 C) or SYNS 2 (p. E 491 K) revealed a dual pathomechanism characterized by a gain- and loss-of-function at the same time. On the one hand insensitivity to the main GDF 5 antagonist NOGGIN (NOG) leads to a GDF 5 gain of function and subsequent SYNS 2 phenotype. Whereas on the other hand, a reduced signaling activity, specifically via the BMP receptor type IA (BMPR 1 A), is likely responsible for the BDA 1 phenotype. These results demonstrate that one mutation in the overlapping interface of antagonist and receptor binding site in GDF 5 can lead to a GDF 5 variant with pathophysiological relevance for both, BDA 1 and SYNS 2 development. Consequently, our study assembles another part of the molecular puzzle of how loss and gain of function mutations in GDF 5 affect bone development in hands and feet resulting in specific types of brachydactyly and SYNS 2. These novel insights into the biology of GDF 5 might also provide further clues on the pathophysiology of OA...|$|E
