5|$|Today, {{one can see}} Gaelic {{written on}} the walls of the parish church, but the {{language}} has effectively died out, and English is totally dominant.

5|$|With {{his newly}} reorganised units, Dahlquist {{attempted}} a direct attack against Montélimar, which failed against the newly arrived German tank units. The subsequent German counter-attack gained some ground against the hills {{occupied by the}} Allies. Its aim was to push the Americans from the hills north of Montélimar and to force the American artillery to move back out of range. After the fighting the Germans captured a copy of Dahlquist's operational plans, giving them a better picture of the Allied forces. As a result, Wiese planned a major attack for 25August by the 11thPanzer Division {{as well as the}} 198th Infantry Division, together with some ad-hoc Luftwaffe battlegroups. This attack was, however, <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> failure. The Allies struck back, retook the hills north of Montélimar, and were able to establish a temporary roadblock on the German escape route. Again, this Allied success also did not last long, as another ad-hoc attack led by Wietersheim reopened the passage at midnight.|$|E
