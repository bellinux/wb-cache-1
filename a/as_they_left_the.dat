5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{were seeking}} {{to emulate the}} success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, who were the current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park {{defeated}} in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train {{on the day before}} the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them well <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left.</b> <b>The</b> team stayed in Richmond the night before the match and made their way into the city at lunchtime on the Saturday.|$|E
5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with}} the Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia.

5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman– who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them– was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E

5|$|The {{diversion}} {{of the boats}} to Pompée prevented Saumarez from launching a planned amphibious assault against Isla Verda with the squadron's Marines, and in the fitful breeze, both Caesar and Audacious were beginning to drift dangerously close to the shoals around the island: if they grounded, then they would share Hannibals fate {{directly in front of}} the island's batteries. Observing the failure of his planned attack on the French squadron, Saumarez raised the signal at 13:35 for his ships to withdraw to Gibraltar. Pompée was already well on the way thanks to the towing boats, and Caesar and Audacious were able to cut their remaining anchors and limp out of the bay with the assistance of a sudden land breeze that carried them rapidly out of reach of the French and Spanish guns. They were joined by Venerable and Spencer <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> <b>the</b> battered squadron retiring to Gibraltar leaving the almost dismasted hulk of Hannibal grounded in Algeciras harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Chris Dawes during the 2012 trade period meant Watts would remain playing in defence for the 2013 season according to Mark Neeld; former Melbourne player, David Schwarz, said {{prior to the}} commencement of the season that Watts would flourish in defence {{and that he would}} ultimately become a consistent player. The opening round loss to Port Adelaide by seventy-nine points at the MCG where he managed just seven disposals saw the players booed by Melbourne fans <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> field; things did not become easier the next week when the club lost to Essendon by 148-points at the MCG, a game in which he was substituted out and was jeered by the crowd when this was announced. His poor to start to the season led to him being dropped for the round three match against West Coast at the MCG; instead of playing for Casey in the VFL, he did not play any football for the weekend. Despite not playing and football for the week, he was recalled to the senior side for the forty-one point win against Greater Western Sydney at the MCG in round four.|$|E
