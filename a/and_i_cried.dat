500|$|Thursday, 3 May, was the {{penultimate}} {{day of the}} family's holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: [...] "Why didn't {{you come}} when [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> last night?" [...] After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top.|$|E
500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Mandisa {{presented}} {{herself to}} the judges prior to the final cut-down to the season's 24 semi-finalists, she told Cowell: [...] "What I {{want to say to}} you is that, yes, you hurt me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> and it was painful, it really was. But I {{want you to know that}} I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, I can certainly extend that same grace to you." [...] Cowell told Mandisa that he was [...] "humbled" [...] and apologized to her immediately.|$|E

50|$|After rock-and-roll swept older {{performers}} {{from the}} charts, Starr subsequently appeared in such television series as NBC's Club Oasis, mostly {{associated with the}} bandleader Spike Jones. However, Starr recorded several albums, including Movin’ (1959), an up-tempo jazz album. Others included Losers, Weepers… (1960) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Cry</b> By Night (1962) in the jazz/blues genre, {{as well as a}} country album entitled Just Plain Country (1962).|$|R
2500|$|Yes, but I don't like it. I {{have to do}} it, but I don't like it at {{all because}} I don't like the kind of voice I have. I really hate {{listening}} to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, [...] "Oh, that was really well sung," [...] or [...] "It was nearly perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the operation, Watson {{could barely}} walk, and the tumour had {{affected}} his pituitary gland which controls hormone levels: [...] "My mood swings went from ecstatic to suicidal. I remember one night {{standing on the}} balcony, full of dark thoughts and self-pity, thinking 'God, this is f**king terrible, why me?' I went back to bed, couldn't sleep, got up again. I thought I'd had enough. If it hadn't been for the girls ..." [...] His energy levels were very low {{and he did not}} leave his house for two months: [...] "I couldn't deal with more than {{one person at a time}} or with multitasking <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> easily." [...] Watson was readmitted to hospital in Manchester for tests on 6 October 2006 after complaining of dizziness, headaches and blurred vision.|$|E
2500|$|When the 1974 {{recording}} of the song was reaching {{number one on the}} country charts, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded. Parton refused. She recalls:I said, 'I'm really sorry,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> all night. I mean, it was like the worst thing. You know, it's like, Oh, my God … Elvis Presley.' And other people were saying, 'You're nuts. It's Elvis Presley.' ...I said, 'I can't do that. Something in my heart says, 'Don't do that. And I just didn't do it... He would have killed it.

2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I will ride this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the sightline of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee. On 21 June, during the World Cup finals, Hansson said, [...] "After the game, we were sitting in the dressing room <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>cried.</b> I realized what a mistake it was." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hugo's {{death from}} {{pneumonia}} on 22 May 1885, {{at the age}} of 83, generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature, he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France. All his life he remained a defender of liberty, equality and fraternity as well as an adamant champion of French culture. In 1877, aged 75, he wrote, [...] "I am not one of these sweet-tempered old men.
