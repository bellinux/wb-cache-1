5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E

Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.|$|E
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> its designation as an SSSI {{is the presence of}} a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E

25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} case {{and one which}} {{has given rise to}} long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by Ascanius and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal for Osage orange, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> its limited historical range despite its adaptability, {{has been the}} subject of debate. One hypothesis is that the Osage orange fruit was eaten by a giant ground sloth that became extinct shortly after the first human settlement of North America. Other extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon and gomphothere, may have fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal. An equine species that became extinct at the same time also has been suggested as the plant's original dispersal agent because modern horses and other livestock will sometimes eat the fruit. However, a 2015 study indicated that Osage orange seeds are not effectively spread by horses or elephant species.|$|E
25|$|Scope: While new {{reactions}} {{are constantly being}} discovered, most reactions have extremely narrow substrate scope <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> such narrow scope is often not understood. In the field of palladium catalysis, after the foundations of mechanistic understanding were established, the scope of reactions saw rapid growth. Knowing the factors that affected each step of catalysis allowed for the chemists to envision and pursue new reactions of high synthetic utility, such as C-H bond activation reactions. In the field hydrogen bond catalysis, chemists have not yet reached a stage where new types of reactivity can be easily and systematically targeted. At this point, reaction discovery is useful, but more detailed mechanistic study is required to realize the full potential of hydrogen bond catalysis.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there were}} white {{characters}} {{on a black}} background, all of plastic. In 1992, the design was changed to one of black characters on a white background in metal or fibreglass; in that same year, the European blue ribbon was added with the Portuguese 'P' denominator. In 1998, a yellow ribbon {{on the right side}} was added with the month and year in which the car was first registered (e.g. 99/12 for December 1999 - the year comes on top of the month). This is different from systems such as in Germany (where the numbers indicate the start and end month of the vehicle's registration) and more similar to systems such as in Italy (where the date indicates the year of vehicle registration). Note that the date is that of first-ever registration of the vehicle, not the date the vehicle was registered in Portugal. Some vehicles carry plates that have a year and month seemingly out of tune with the alphanumeric sequence, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this is that these are imported used vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Suda's {{style of}} writing and {{direction}} {{has been compared to}} the works of Quentin Tarantino. A defining part of Suda's original work has been its balance of humor, dark or mature themes, violence and sexuality. His focus on death is because he feels it needs a rationale behind it, and so he focuses on those closely tied with death such as assassins. In his action titles, he considered the reasons behind each character's wish to fight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their deaths. His portrayal of death in his games was influenced by his time as an undertaker. Sexuality, while a big part of many of Suda's works, is not an important element from his perspective, and when used he is attempting to express a core part of the overall story and theme. Another recurring theme in his work from The Silver Case onwards is the focus on the criminal elements in society, in addition to people with equally valid views coming into conflict with each other. Following the serious tone of The Silver Case, Flower, Sun, and Rain saw a stylistic shift to a more light and casual tone. This approach of switching styles for each successive original project would be repeated by Suda throughout his career: when talking about the contrast between Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer is Dead he described is as a yin-yang effect.|$|E
