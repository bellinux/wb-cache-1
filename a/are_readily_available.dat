5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E

5|$|The art of batik is {{most highly}} {{developed}} in the island of Java in Indonesia. In Java, all the materials for the process <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made. Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the Dutch archaeologist J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as Toraja, Flores, Halmahera, and Papua, which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have an age-old tradition of batik making.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{frequent}} bus connections to {{other cities in}} Jordan, {{as well as to}} major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.|$|E
5|$|With large {{metallic}} red inflorescences {{and attractive}} feathery leaves that {{are perhaps the}} softest of all Banksia species, B.brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour {{as soon as they}} open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.|$|E

5|$|Government {{television}} and radio broadcasting centers, and the headquarters of numerous private stations are located in Antananarivo. Eighty percent of households in Antananarivo own a radio; the medium is popular across social classes. Stations like Fenon'ny Merina appeal to Merina listeners of all ages by playing traditional and contemporary music of the highlands region. Youth-oriented stations play a blend of Western artists and Malagasy performers of Western genres, as well as fusion and coastal musical styles. Evangelical broadcasts and daily international and local news are available in Malagasy, French and English. Forty percent of Antananarivo residents own a television receiver. All major Malagasy newspapers are printed {{in the city and}} are widely available. Communications services in Antananarivo are the best in the country. Internet and mobile telephone networks <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> and affordable, although disruptions in service occur periodically. The national postal service is headquartered in Antananarivo, and private international shipping companies like FedEx, DHL Express and United Parcel Service provide services to the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} is nocturnal {{over most of}} its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available,</b> barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations <b>are</b> <b>readily</b> <b>available,</b> involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
