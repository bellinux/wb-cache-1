5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops <b>a</b> <b>cavernous</b> opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To report late {{recurrence}} of orbital <b>cavernous</b> hemangioma in <b>a</b> patient {{ten years after}} complete resection of the primary tumor. Case Report: A 32 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} progressive visual loss and proptosis underwent lateral orbitotomy for resection of <b>a</b> large <b>cavernous</b> hemangioma. Ten years later, proptosis recurred and the patient developed progressive ocular deviation. Imaging studies were in favor of <b>a</b> recurrent <b>cavernous</b> hemangioma and the tumor was excised via the previous incision site. Reassessment of previous orbital images suggested the presence of two separate tumors, only one of which had been excised at the time of initial surgery. Conclusion: Recurrent orbital cavernous hemangioma may follow incomplete excision of multiple orbital lesions with gradual growth of unidentified residual tumors. Accordingly, when <b>an</b> encapsulated <b>cavernous</b> hemangioma is removed, exploration is recommended to rule out multiple lesions...|$|R

Notable stations from this period include Moor Park, the stations of the Piccadilly line extension to Heathrow and Hillingdon. The stations of the 1990s extension of the Jubilee line were much larger than before and designed in a high-tech style by architects such as Norman Foster and Michael Hopkins, making extensive use of exposed metal plating.

[...] The door was also the entrance for harvest wagons leading to the Diele which was like <b>a</b> <b>cavernous</b> hall, hence the alternative name {{for this type of}} farmhouse, the Hallenhaus ("hall house"). The Diele was formed by the space between the two rows of supporting uprights. With its tamped clay floor it was the working room of the farmhouse.

It also provided protection from the weather for activities, such as the drying of farm implements, the breaking of flax, the spinning of textiles or the threshing of grain. Celebrations, too, were held in the hall and recently deceased members of the family were laid out here.
