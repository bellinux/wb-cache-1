An {{increasing number of}} marine renewable energy (MRE) systems are reaching the stage where a working prototype must be demonstrated in operation in order to progress to {{the next stage of}} commercial projects. This stage {{is often referred to as}} ‘valley of death’ where device developers face the challenge of raising capital needed to demonstrate the prototype. The dilemma is that investors understandably demand a proven track record and demonstrated reliability in order to provide capital. One way to resolve this dilemma is specific <b>component</b> reliability <b>testing</b> that not only satisfies investor expectations but holds the potential to improve and de-risk components for MRE. This paper gives an overview to different <b>component</b> reliability <b>test</b> approaches in established industries and for MRE, covering both wave and tidal energy technologies. There has been notable activity in the research community to develop and implement dedicated <b>component</b> reliability <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> that allow the investigation and demonstration of component reliability under controlled, yet representative conditions. Two case studies of physical <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> will illustrate the possible test approaches. The Nautilus Powertrain <b>test</b> <b>rig,</b> a facility at the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, focuses on the demonstration and testing of drive train components including gearboxes, generators, mechanical couplings and bearings. The Dynamic Marine <b>Component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> (DMaC) at the University of Exeter aims to replicate the forces and motions for floating offshore applications and their subsystems, including mooring lines and power cables. This paper highlights the relevance of <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> and qualification prior to large-scale commercial deployments and gives an insight to some of the test capabilities available in the sector.

The design and analysis is documented of the high pressure compressor which was tested {{as part of the}} Pratt and Whitney effort under the Energy Efficient Engine program. This compressor was designed to produce a 14 : 1 pressure ratio in ten stages with an adiabatic efficiency of 88. 2 percent in the flight propulsion system. The corresponding expected efficiency for the compressor <b>component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is 86. 5 percent.

Low loss, highly loaded airfoils are used to increase efficiency while reducing the parts count. Active clearance control and case trenches in abradable strips over the blade tips are included in the compressor component design to further increase the efficiency potential. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> incorporates variable geometry stator vanes in all stages to permit maximum flexibility in developing stage-to-stage matching.

40|$|Asperity {{friction}} is a main indicator {{for wear}} and heat conduction [1]. It occurs when thickness of oil film shrinks {{due to high}} load or slow speed. Friction is scientifically well known {{as long as it}} is dominated by laminar oil film effects. If film thickness shrinks, the friction coefficient depends mainly on surface properties. This inaccuracy is normally preceded in simulation by using friction coefficients defined by Coulomb’s law [2]. To improve simulation results, the simulated friction moment was compared to measurement on a <b>component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> Friction moment is produced on every square millimetre of the bearing surface, but can only be measured as an integral. Research findings show that measured results can’t be met by using one global dry friction coefficient for the whole bearing surface, even though it is material dependent. By introducing locally resolved and asperity pressure dependent dry friction coefficients, it was possible to adapt the simulated friction moment to measure one with a deviation of less than 5 percent. By means of simulation it was possible to develop locally resolved results based on integral measurements; and improve modelling the frictional state of mixed lubrication...|$|R

40|$|Helicopter health {{monitoring}} systems use vibration signatures generated from damaged components to identify transmission faults. For damaged gears, these signatures relate {{to changes in}} dynamics due to the meshing of the damaged tooth. These signatures, referred to as condition indicators (CI), can perform differently when measured on different systems, such as a <b>component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig,</b> or a full-scale transmission test stand, or an aircraft. These differences can result from dissimilarities in systems design and environment under dynamic operating conditions. The static structure can also filter the response between the vibration source and the accelerometer, when the accelerometer is installed on the housing. To assess the utility of static vibration transfer paths for predicting gear CI performance, measurements were taken on the NASA Glenn Spiral Bevel Gear Fatigue Test Rig. The vibration measurements were taken {{to determine the effect}} of torque, accelerometer location and gearbox design on accelerometer response. Measurements were taken at the housing and compared while impacting the gear set near mesh. These impacts were made at gear mesh to simulate gear meshing dynamics.

All measurements were carried out in Volvo Cars <b>component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> where pressure jump and air flow rate through a cooling fan and shroud mounted on a heat exchanger were measured. In order to make relevant comparisons, a detailed numerical model of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> with fan, shroud and heat exchanger were created. A mesh with high node density, in total 14 million tetrahedral elements, was used and the simulations were carried out with the standard k-å turbulence model. The comparisons were performed for different air flow rates, rotational speeds, cooling packages, and for setups with open and closed speed flaps. The Multiple Reference Frame approach reproduces fan performance with good accuracy for most cases. For these cases measured and computed data differ with less than 3. 5 % air flow rate. Moreover, the MRF approach generates good results for open and closed speed flaps {{as well as for}} idle conditions. It also introduces swirl leading to a realistic prediction of the velocity distribution downstream the fan. The MRF method is well suited when doing flow simulations within the engine room and is therefore recommended to use.

These tests are performed at operating conditions comparable to operating conditions the component would be exposed to while installed on the aircraft. Performance of seeded fault tests is one method used to provide evidence that a Health Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) can replace current maintenance practices required for aircraft airworthiness. Actual in-service experience of the HUMS detecting a component fault is another validation method.

40|$|The {{technological}} {{evolution of}} more efficient natural gas-fuelled large bore engines aggravates the load situation within {{the engine and}} thus as well the tribological system valve spindle/seat ring. As {{a result of these}} changes, valve recession increases and component lifetime decreases, i. e. higher failure rates and more frequent service intervals. The tribological issues {{can be traced back to}} the cleaner combustion which demonstrably suppresses the formation of a protective layer on the sealing faces. In this work, StelliteÂ® and TribaloyÂ®-hardfaced valve spindles with different operating hours and from the same gas engine were analyzed in terms of quantitative wear, oxidation and microstructural alterations in the wear scar. The observed wear mechanisms are based on microstructure fatigue and delamination, depending on the microstructure of the hardfacing. The severely worn sealing interfaces show no tribofilm at all, whereas a protective oxide layer is observed on the surface of the TribaloyÂ® hardfacing that features low wear. The second part of this work describes wear phenomena observed on specimens from laboratory experiments using a newly developed <b>component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> â the valve spindle tribometer.

40|$|The {{design of}} a clean {{combustion}} technology based on lean combustion principles will have to face combustion instability. This oscillation is often discovered late in engine development when unfortunately only a few degrees of freedom still exist to solve the problem. Individual <b>component</b> <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are usually not useful in detecting combustion instability {{at an early stage}} because {{they do not have the}} same acoustic boundary conditions as the full engine. An example of this unsteady activity phenomenon observed during the operation of a high-pressure core is presented and analyzed. To support the investigation work, two numerical tools have been extensively used: (1) experimental measurement of unsteady pressure and the results of a multidimensional acoustic code are used to confirm that the frequency variations of the observed modes within the operating domain of the high pressure core are due to the excitation of the first and second azimuthal combustor modes. The impact of acoustic boundary conditions for the combustor exhaust is shown to control the appearance and mode transition of this unsteady activity. (2) 3 D reacting and non-reacting Large Eddy Simulations (LES) for the complete combustor and for the injection system cup alone suggest that the aerodynamic instability of the flow passing through the cup could be the noise source exciting the azimuthal acoustic modes of the chamber. Based on these results, the air system (cup) was re-designed in order to suppress this aerodynamic instability and experimental combustion tests confirm that the new system is free of combustion instability...|$|R

One key area of power loss in the driven axles of heavy on-road vehicles and off-highway vehicles is the disengaged wet brake conjunctions.

The obtained data about the behavior of the mechanical model has been used for the verification of the real-time contact model inside of a dSpace Modular System, built on the DS 1006 Processor boar...|$|R
40|$|Typical damage {{modes of}} rotor blade {{bearings}} are mainly related to oscillating movements with small angles under high loads. Under these conditions, the lubrication film between rollers and raceways of the bearings tends to collapse, which causes metal to metal contact and surface induced damage. Since established calculation methods for lifetime prediction are unsuitable for wind turbine blade bearings, full-scale <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are developed to close this particular knowledge gap. To generate realistic boundary conditions for bearing tests, the stiffness of the interfaces such as blade and hub {{have to be}} investigated. Because of the disadvantages of using real <b>components</b> within these <b>test</b> <b>rigs,</b> a possible solution is to use substitute components which aim to emulate the interface behaviour of the real components. This paper presents a method to derive a substitute of a rotor hub based on a FE-model of the virtual IWT 7. 5 - 164 research turbine. The results indicate that it is feasible to match the interface stiffness of the considered rotor hub with a corresponding substitute with only minor limitations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTurbocharging {{technique}} {{is more and}} more widely employed on compression ignition and spark ignition internal combustion engines, as well, to improve performance and reduce total displacement. Experimental studies, developed on dedicated test facilities, can supply a lot of information to optimize the engine-turbocharger matching, especially if tests can be extended to the typical engine operating conditions (unsteady flow). A specialized <b>components</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> (particularly suited to study automotive turbochargers) has been operating since several years at the University of Genoa. The test facility allows to develop studies under steady or unsteady flow conditions both on single components and subassemblies of engine intake and exhaust circuit. In the paper the results of an experimental campaign developed on a turbocharger waste-gated turbine for gasoline engine application are presented. Preliminarily, the measurement of the turbine steady flow performance map is carried out. In a second step the same <b>component</b> is <b>tested</b> under unsteady flow conditions. Instantaneous inlet and outlet static pressure, mass flow rate and turbocharger rotational speed are measured, together with average inlet and outlet temperatures. A numerical procedure, recently developed at the University of Naples, is then utilized to predict the steady turbine performance map, following a 1 D approach. The model geometrically schematizes the component basing on few linear and angular dimensions directly measured on the hardware. Then, the 1 D steady flow equations are solved within the stationary and rotating channels constituting the device. All the main flow losses are properly taken into account in the model. The procedure is able to provide the sole “wheel-map” and the overall turbine map. After a tuning, the overall turbine map is compared with the experimental one, showing a very good agreement. Moreover, in order to improve the accuracy of a 1 D engine simulation model, the classical map-based approach is suitably corrected with a sequence of pipes that schematizes each component of the device (inlet/outlet ducts, volute and wheel) included upstream and downstream the turbine to account for the wave propagation and accumulation phenomena inside the machine. In this case, the previously computed “wheel-map” is utilized. The turbine pipes dimensions, are automatically provided by the geometrical module of the proposed procedure to correctly reproduce the device volume and the flow path length...|$|R
40|$|Modern wind {{turbines}} are enormous large-scale electromechanical systems. They operate in complex conditions, {{determined by a}} turbulent wind field, by possible disturbances in the electricity grid and by the behavior of sea waves for offshore turbines. Guaranteeing the structural integrity of these machines during a lifetime of 20 years is an enormous challenge. In this paper the dynamics of a wind turbine drive train high speed subsystem is studied both by modeling and experiments with focus on system torsional and flexural vibrations and transient events which can reduce fatigue life of functional components (gearbox, bearings, shafts, couplings, others). A scaled down drive train high speed shaft <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> has been developed. Main <b>components</b> of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> are six-pole motor with variable frequency drive controller (up to 1000 rpm), shafts' disk coupling and flexible mounting structure representing gearbox housing with output high speed bearing. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is equipped with measurement system comprising a set of accelerometers and displacement sensors, data acquisition hardware and software (SKF WindCon 3. 0). Mathematical and computational models of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> have been developed and went through validation tests. The system kinematic and dynamic responses are studied for different operational scenarios and structural parameters (ratio of shaft bending stiffness and stiffness of mounting structures, unevenly inertia load distribution, others). The ultimate goal of the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is to get insight into interaction between internal dynamics of drive train functional components to be used the results obtained in developing novel methods to detect, predict and prevent faults and failures in wind turbine drive trains arising due to misalignments and transient external loads...|$|R
