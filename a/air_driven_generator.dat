40|$|As the {{aircraft}} industries {{are moving toward}} more electric aircraft (MEA), the electrical peak load seen by the main and emergency generators becomes higher than in conventional aircraft. Consequently, {{there is a major}} concern regarding {{the aircraft}} emergency system, which consists of a ram air turbine (RAT) or <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> <b>generator</b> (ADG), to fulfill the load demand during critical situations; particularly at low aircraft speed where the output power is very low. A potential solution under study by most aircraft manufacturers is to replace the air turbine by a fuel cell hybrid system, consisting of fuel cell combined with other high power density sources such as supercapacitors or lithium-ion batteries. To ensure the fuel cell hybrid system will be able to meet the load demand, it must be properly designed and an effective energy management strategy must be tested with real situations load profile. This work aims at designing a fuel cell emergency power system of a more electric aircraft and comparing different energy management schemes (EMS); with the goal to ensure the load demand is fully satisfied within the constraints of each energy source. The fuel cell hybrid system considered in this study consists of fuel cell, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, along with associated DC-DC and DC-AC converters. The energy management schemes addressed are state-of-the-art, most commonly used energy management techniques in fuel cell vehicle applications and include: the state machine control strategy, the rule based fuzzy logic strategy, the classical PI control strategy, the frequency decoupling/fuzzy logic control strategy and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). Moreover, a new optimal scheme based on maximizing the instantaneous energy of batteries/supercapacitors, to improve the fuel economy is proposed. An off-line optimization based scheme is also developed to ascertain the validity of the proposed strategy in terms of fuel consumption. The energy management schemes are compared based on the following criteria: the hydrogen consumption, the state of charges of the batteries and supercapacitors and the overall system efficiency. Moreover the stress on each energy source, which impacts their life cycle, are measured using a new approach based on the wavelet transform of their instantaneous power. A simulation model and an experimental test bench are developed to validate all analysis and performances. The main results obtained are as follows: the state machine control scheme provided a slightly better efficiency and stresses on the batteries and supercapacitors. The classical PI control and the proposed scheme had the lowest fuel consumption and more use of the battery energy. As expected, the lowest fuel cell stress and lowest use of the battery energy was achieved with the frequency decoupling and fuzzy logic scheme, but at the expense of more fuel consumption and lower overall efficiency. The DC bus or supercapacitor voltage was maintained nearly constant for all the schemes. Also, the proposed strategy performed slightly better than the ECMS in terms of efficiency and fuel consumption, with an increase in fuel economy by 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind farms. This trend {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared generators and gearless (direct <b>drive)</b> <b>generators</b> have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades. Direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> based on permanent magnet technology have a high efficiency, less components and lower speeds that can translate to high energy yield and less maintenance demand. However, the mass of such direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> can be significantly higher than of other geared generators. This thesis focuses on the issue of mass reduction of large direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> in wind turbines. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate methods of mass reduction in large direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> in wind turbines especially mass reduction by introducing structural flexibility in the generator. This allowance in structural flexibility is enabled by the use of magnetic bearing technology. EPPElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

The use of magnetic bearings has a possibility {{to reduce the}} weight of the direct <b>drive</b> <b>generator.</b> The control system for such magnetic bearings is considered. In the beginning, the thesis discusses the problems of direct <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> in large wind turbines, introduces a hybrid concept of active magnetic bearings, gives a demonstrator of magnetic bearings used in this project, and presents a basic control system of active magnetic bearings. For the purpose of support such magnetic bearings in wind turbines, this thesis gives a complete control system. This control system includes electrical circuits and decentralized control method. The implementation of the electrical circuits is distributed into two PCBs. The decentralized control method is designed with six PID controllers. Finally, in order to improve the stability of the system, the H-infinity control method is suggested to magnetic bearing system in wind turbine applications.
