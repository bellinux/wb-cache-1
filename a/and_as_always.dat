Not only will you want to replay this clip, but her voice on the song will get you to see in a completely different light." [...] The Voice contestant Christian Cuevas performed a cover of the song during the eleventh season of the show. The performance was appreciated with the judges complimenting it for creating an [...] "incredible moment" [...] for the show. Gaga also tweeted her approval of Cuevas' singing prowess.|$|E

Sweeney's first at bat {{was interrupted by a}} standing ovation. His second at bat was delayed as well due to applause. Sweeney was removed from first base in the 7th inning and was given a third standing ovation. Sweeney entered the dugout, and upon still hearing fans roaring, he exited the dugout towards the field and bowed, waved, and said [...] "Thank you." [...] After the game, Sweeney and his two children rounded the bases as part of a Sunday home game tradition at Kauffman Stadium called [...] "Sunday Fan Fun Run." [...] Then he spent time talking to reporters, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>always,</b> signed autographs for fans before he left the parking lot. Since Leaving the Kansas City Royals his Number 29 has been left out of circulation leading some to believe the Royals might end up retiring his number one day.

2500|$|The Reader abounds with {{references}} to representations of the Holocaust, both external and internal to Michael's narrative, some real and some invented by Schlink. Of the latter, {{the most important is}} the book by the death-march survivor that constitutes the basis of the case against Hanna. It is summarized at some length and even briefly quoted, although its title is never given. Michael must read it in English since its German translation has not yet been published: [...] "(It was) an unfamiliar and laborious exercise at the time. <b>And</b> <b>as</b> <b>always,</b> the alien language, unmastered and struggled over, created a strange concatenation of distance and immediacy." [...] On a second reading in later life, he says, [...] "it is the book that creates distance." [...] For Michael, written media alone cannot convey a full impression of the Holocaust: the victims are not sympathetic, and the oppressors are too faceless to be judged. He cannot muster up the empathy to [...] "make the experience part of his internal life," [...] according to Froma Zeitlin. Hanna, however, has the opposite experience upon reading books by Holocaust survivors. She tells Michael: ...|$|E
2500|$|High Def Digest gave {{a rating}} of 4 stars, writing [...] "The Simpsons' {{is one of only}} a handful of shows that I know I'm {{guaranteed}} to laugh out loud at least once an episode (usually more). Even though the cutting wit of the first decade lost its edge a bit, I still find 'The Simpsons' an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time. There aren't many things that are better than sitting down with a new season of 'The Simpsons' on Blu-ray and watching every episode back to back as fast as I possibly can. While the episodes sort of blend together, the humor is still there, and I still end up having quite a few genuine laughs". CraveOnline rated the season 8.5/10, noting [...] "Some [...] "Simpsons" [...] fans gave up during a perceived rough patch around season 12, and boy have they missed out. Season 13 was a particular favorite of mine, but now we're over the hump on the DVD releases. Season 15 is kind of a sweet spot, because it's got some highlight episodes I love, but also plenty that I don't remember." [...] DVDActive said [...] "The Simpsons season 15 isn't one of the series' best, but I'm pretty sure it isn't one of the worst either". ScreenJabber gave {{a rating of}} 4 stars, writing [...] "Imagine my surprise when I sat down to review Season 15...and realised that I had never seen most of its episodes. Imagine, then, my joy at being able to enjoy almost 22 episodes of factory-fresh Simpsons, even though they were made about a decade ago. And even though some of the cultural references are a little dated, there's still an awful lot to laugh at and enjoy here. As always, this season of The Simpsons features a stellar line-up of guest stars. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>always,</b> there are some standout episodes. All in all, a more than decent season of this long, long-running show." [...] DIY wrote [...] "While Season 15 of The Simpsons may not be golden from start to finish it has a higher great to soggy episode ratio than more recent seasons. In fact, there are some real gems amongst the 22 episodes". Boxofficebuz gave it 4 stars, and said [...] "...Throw in flashback episode 'The Way We ,' Pie-Man antics in 'Simple Simpson' and a Catch Me If You Can spoof in 'Catch 'Em If You Can,' you have a solid, solid season. A definite uptick over the previous couple seasons". BubbleBlabber rated it 9.0 out of 10, and concluded [...] "In terms of the content, Season 15 was a highly underrated season for The Simpsons and brought along a number of now well-known classics". DVDMg gave the season a B, and wrote [...] "Should viewers expect greatness from Season 15 of The Simpsons? No, as the year comes with some mediocre shows. Still, it delivers a reasonable number of good episodes and seems worthwhile overall...S15 won't win over new fans, but it's usually fun".|$|E

Then Knell came in and seated himself without any of his chief's ease. He seemed preoccupied <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>always,</b> cold.|$|E
60|$|The Presbyterians now desired yearly General Assemblies (of which James VI. had unlawfully {{robbed the}} Kirk); the {{enforcement}} of an old brief-lived system of restrictions (caveats) on the bishops; {{the abolition of the}} Articles of Perth; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>always,</b> of the Liturgy.
