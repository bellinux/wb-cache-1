25|$|In Ethiopia, <b>avocados</b> {{are made}} into juice by mixing them with sugar and milk or water, usually served with Vimto and {{a slice of}} lemon. It is also common to serve layered {{multiple}} fruit juices in a glass (locally called Spris) made of <b>avocados,</b> mangoes, bananas, guavas, and papayas. <b>Avocados</b> are also used to make salads.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Avocados,</b> {{native to}} Central and South America, {{have long been}} {{produced}} in California. [...] In 1989, California produced 90 percent of fresh <b>avocados</b> consumed in the United States (frozen and processed <b>avocados</b> are imported regularly from other countries). As of 2008, approximately 6,500 growers produce <b>avocados</b> on 60,000 bearing acres of land (less than 100 square miles). Price and production levels vary from season to season, and from year to year, due to weather and incidents such as fires. In a typical year production averages 350 million pounds at a wholesale price of $1 per pound, although 2008 was an exceptionally low yield year. [...] Most <b>avocados</b> are grown from San Luis Obispo south, with San Diego County the largest producer.|$|R
5|$|Some milk sponge cakes can be {{topped with}} <b>avocado</b> crazy, a food in Sri Lankan cuisine. <b>Avocado</b> crazy can be {{prepared}} with <b>avocado,</b> cream, sugar and lemon juice. Rum may also be added. <b>Avocado</b> crazy may have a creamy texture and flavor.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} used {{can include}} yogurt, buttermilk, raisins, dates, walnuts, hazelnuts, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg among others. Lemon juice {{may be used}} on the <b>avocado</b> to prevent browning from occurring. <b>Avocado</b> cake can be prepared as a vegetarian and vegan dish. Chocolate cake and pancakes can be prepared with <b>avocado</b> as an ingredient in the batter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Avocado</b> cheesecake is a {{style of}} cheesecake {{prepared}} using <b>avocado</b> as a main ingredient.

5|$|Salat <b>avocado</b> is an Israeli-style <b>avocado</b> salad, {{with lemon}} juice and chopped scallions (spring onions), was {{introduced}} by farmers who planted <b>avocado</b> trees on the coastal plain in the 1920s. Avocados have since become a winter delicacy and are cut into salads {{as well as being}} spread on bread.|$|E
5|$|The Spinks {{variety of}} <b>avocado,</b> Persea {{americana}} 'Spinks', {{was developed by}} William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a University of California at Berkeley and California <b>Avocado</b> Association comparison of <b>avocado</b> strains. The Spinks <b>avocado</b> fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They also {{proved to be the}} second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.|$|E
5|$|<b>Avocado</b> brownies are brownies {{prepared}} using <b>avocado</b> as {{a primary}} ingredient. The use of overripe avocados {{may contribute to the}} gooey, fudge-like consistency of the dish. Black beans can be used in the dish, and can be used in the place of flour.|$|E
40|$|Research into post-harvest {{management}} {{aspects of}} export <b>avocados</b> {{has shown that}} the following factors are paramount in the concept of temperature management: Early season fruit is more sensitive to low temperatures than late season fruit. The optimum temperature and storage conditions for <b>avocados</b> vary between cultivars. Optimum temperatures and storage periods vary with both maturity and the stage of fruit development. Higher temperatures during the early stages, and lower temperatures during the later stages of storage tend to decrease physiological disorders. Later set <b>avocados</b> are much more sensitive to low storage temperatures than earlier set fruit. The time / temperature relationship is an important factor determining fruit quality. The quantity of wax used influences the shelf-life of <b>avocados.</b> Based on the above principles, a proposal on the temperature regime for South African export <b>avocados</b> is presented. Strict maintenance of the cold chain and the time-temperature relationships are the most important factors determining fruit quality. The importance of humidity in the design of cooling systems is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Coating {{comprising}} the plant protein, kafirin, propylene glycol (PG) and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) {{have been shown}} to extend the quality of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears. In this study, both of these coating treatments considerably extended the shelf-life and the time that the eat-ripe quality of ‘Hass’ <b>avocados</b> was maintained when compared to uncoated fruit. To determine the roles of the additives, PG and GDL in the functionality of kafirin edible coatings, different kafirin coatings were applied to ‘Hass’ <b>avocados</b> prior to storage under ripening conditions of 18 °C for up to 21 days. All the kafirin coatings were effective at extending and maintaining the shelf-life quality of <b>avocados</b> compared to uncoated fruit due to reduced respiration rate, 102 ml CO 2 /kg/h for kafirin-PG+GDL compared to 115 ml CO 2 /kg/h uncoated <b>avocados</b> on day 14 and consequently reduced ethylene production of the coated fruit. Kafirin-PG+GDL coated <b>avocados</b> lost less weight and remained firmer than uncoated fruit. Descriptive sensory analysis showed kafirin-PG+GDL coatings were most effective, extending the quality of the <b>avocados</b> 7 days beyond the untreated control due to improved kafirin solvation facilitated by the GDL. Thus kafirin-PG+GDL coatings are an effective method of increasing shelf-life and extending the eat-ripe quality of climacteric fruit. South African National Research Foundation. [URL] Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Scirtothrips perseae Nakahara was {{discovered}} attacking <b>avocados</b> in California,USA, in 1996. Host plant surveys in California indicated that S. perseae has a highly restricted host range with larvae being found only on <b>avocados,</b> while adults {{were collected from}} 11 different plant species. As part of a management program for this pest, a ‘‘classical’’ biological control program was initiated and foreign exploration was conducted to delineate the home range of S. perseae, to survey for associated natural enemies and inventory other species of phytophagous thrips on <b>avocados</b> grown in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad, and Brazil. Foreign exploration efforts indicate that S. perseae occurs on <b>avocados</b> grown at high altitudes (3 ̆e 1500 m) from Uruapan in Mexico south to areas around Guatemala City in Guatemala. In Costa Rica, S. perseae is replaced by an undescribed congener as the dominant phytophagous thrips on <b>avocados</b> grown at high altitudes (3 ̆e 1300 m). No species of Scirtothrips were found on <b>avocados</b> in the Dominican Republic, Trinidad, or Brazil. In total, 2136 phytophagous thrips were collected and identified, representing over 47 identified species from at least 19 genera. The significance of these species records is discussed.

5|$|One of its {{international}} failures was the BK Crown Jewels line of sandwiches, originally sold in New Zealand. These larger, adult-oriented sandwiches {{were made with}} fried and grilled chicken or a Whopper patty {{and a variety of}} toppings and served on a Kaiser roll. Toppings included a mango lime sauce, <b>avocado,</b> aioli, a Cajun spiced sauce, and relish. Originally successful, the sandwiches piqued the interest of Burger King's corporate offices and were being considered for a potential global rollout. However, interest in the product faded and they were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The Campo road {{served as}} a wagon road {{providing}} access to eastern San Diego County as well as Imperial County. The road {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933, and signs for Route94 were posted along local roads later that decade. Efforts to convert the western half of the route to a freeway got underway in the 1950s, and the freeway was complete by 1962 west of the road that became SR125. Construction continued east to <b>Avocado</b> Road over the next few years. Various proposals for widening the highway have come from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but local opposition resulted in the delay or cancellation of many of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|The mantles of the Muisca were {{decorated}} with various colours. The colours {{were obtained from}} seeds; the seed of the <b>avocado</b> for green, flowers; saffron for orange and indigo weed for blue, fruits, crust and roots of plants, from animals as the cochineal insect producing purple colours, and minerals as the blue and green clays of Siachoque, the coloured earth of Suta and the yellow sediments of Soracá. Also curuba, the flowers of the potato plant (Solanum andigenum) and other colouring materials (Rumex obtusifolia, Bixa orellana, Arrabidaea chica and more) were used. The colours were applied using pencils, applying coloured threads or using stamps. The textiles were produced using various techniques, similar to the Aymara of southern South America and the Mesoamerican cultures. Small textiles functioned as money, just like the tejuelos of gold or salt was used.|$|E
