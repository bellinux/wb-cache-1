5|$|Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's {{route network}} was {{affected}} by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA <b>Air</b> <b>operated</b> regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E
5|$|Coast Air {{continued}} {{to provide a}} service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial {{for the use of}} public service obligations for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by Teddy Air, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving. Teddy <b>Air</b> <b>operated</b> until 1August 1999, when Widerøe took over using de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule. Widerøe's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when Guard Air, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the tender, and started flying with Dornier 228 aircraft. On 8October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Widerøe to fly the route. The subsequent tender was won by Arctic Air, who continued operation until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.|$|E

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Canadian airline Lamb <b>Air</b> <b>operated</b> several C-46s from their bases in Thompson and Churchill, Manitoba. One of the largest C-46 operators was Air Manitoba, whose fleet of aircraft featured gaudy color schemes for individual aircraft. In the 1990s, these aircraft were divested to other owner/operators.|$|E

25|$|To {{secure a}} running organization, Maersk bought Falck Air on 21 February 1969. There was {{internal}} disagreement about the airline's future strategy amongst its owner, the Falck Group. They therefore sold it as a discounted rate to Maersk. At the time Falck <b>Air</b> <b>operated</b> {{a fleet of}} two de Havilland Herons and two Hawker Siddeley HS 748 aircraft and a hangar at Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup. The airline had ordered three Fokker F27 Friendships, the first which was delivered on 9 December. The second was delivered on 17 December, but was written off ten days later when it crashed after failing to become airborne after a touch and go at Rønne Airport.|$|E
25|$|By 1998 the Bergen-based {{shipping}} owner Bjarne Rieber {{had bought}} {{a third of the}} airline. Oslo's main airport was moved from Fornebu to Gardermoen on 8 October 1998. This caused the driving time to the main airport from among other places Grenland to increase by about an hour. GuardAir was one of two airlines which believed that the distance was sufficient to allow for a feeder air route out of Skien Airport, Geiterygen. Both GuardAir and Teddy Air launched their services on 25 October, with GuardAir flying three round trips daily with a Do 228. Teddy <b>Air</b> <b>operated</b> an Embraer 110 and had nearly the same departure times. Within a month Teddy Air had withdrawn from the Oslo route.|$|E
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with <b>air</b> <b>operated</b> brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|E
