5|$|In 1935, David Clay, one of {{the boys}} assumed to have been killed, is found alive in Hesperia, California. He reveals that {{one of the}} boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter, and <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> escaped, but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine hope he is alive.|$|E
5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in <b>another</b> <b>boy,</b> have been {{nothing more than}} a reaction to the impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its own sake.|$|E
5|$|When You Reach Me {{follows a}} sixth-grade protagonist, Miranda. She {{lives with her}} single mother who has a {{kindhearted}} boyfriend, Richard.

5|$|Back at the dance, Harry's {{group are}} outside {{and take the}} {{assumption}} {{that they have been}} abandoned by Harry because he has not showed up. In actuality, Harry is hiding at the wall near them and takes another drink of the vial of formula before walking off. Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with <b>another</b> <b>boy.</b> Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E
5|$|Karofsky {{is elected}} prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt {{runs from the}} gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Henry Tippett decided {{to live in}} France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter {{remained}} at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who {{introduced him to the}} music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> played a C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette's operetta Les Cloches de Corneville. Despite his parents' wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to Cambridge University, Tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.|$|E
50|$|Although {{when the}} Yeshiva closed, {{the area was}} {{becoming}} much more Chasidic, the area included 2 other well known long-time non-Chasidic schools. Down the block from Etz Chaim was a girls' school, Shulamith and, 7 blocks away, <b>another</b> <b>boys</b> school, Toras Emes.|$|R

5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended her, and {{to tell her that}} they should be friends. It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating <b>another</b> <b>boy.</b> Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E
25|$|In his teens, Babel {{hoped to}} get into the preparatory class of the Nicolas I Odessa Commercial School. However, he first had to {{overcome}} the Jewish quota. Despite the fact that Babel received passing grades, his place was given to <b>another</b> <b>boy,</b> whose parents had bribed school officials. As a result, he was schooled at home by private tutors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>boy,</b> Alexander Petrovich Zhelobkovich (1930–1994), who was 12 {{years old}} at the time, also survived.

After the war, he served in the armed forces and later became a reserve lieutenant colonel.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Gacy's {{father was}} {{informed}} that his son and <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> had been caught sexually fondling a young girl. As a punishment, Gacy was whipped by his father with a razor strop. The same year, Gacy himself was ostensibly molested by a family friend, a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck, then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid his father would blame him.|$|E

25|$|As a youth, Edge {{demonstrated}} {{a desire to}} succeed in business and he acquired an interest in politics. At the age of ten, he and <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> started a four-page weekly newspaper devoted to social news, the Pleasantville Bladder, which had a circulation of approximately one hundred. Edge also attended Pleasantville Republican party rallies and later recounted that he came away from these events feeling great excitement and a growing determination to someday participate in politics himself.|$|E
25|$|The Hotel Manager and a porter are organising the {{departure}} of the last guests, the Polish family among them. Aschenbach inquires as to their time of departure, then leaves to sit on the deserted beach where Tadzio and <b>another</b> <b>boy,</b> Jaschiu, are playing. The game becomes rougher and Jaschiu dominates, pushing Tadzio's face into the sand. In an attempt to assist, Aschenbach tries to get up but is too weak. Jaschiu and the other children run away, leaving Tadzio on the beach alone with Aschenbach. Tadzio beckons the author, but he slumps in his chair. Tadzio continues walking far out to sea.|$|E
25|$|That desire {{manifested}} in two attempted murders. The first happened when Jesperson was around 10 years old. He was {{friends with a}} boy named Martin, and the two would often get into trouble together. Jesperson claimed he was punished many times for things Martin had done and blamed on Jesperson. This led Jesperson to attack Martin, violently beating him until his father pulled him away. He later claimed his intention was to kill the boy. Approximately a year later, Jesperson was swimming in a lake when <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> held him under water until he blacked out. Some time later, at a public pool, Jesperson attempted to drown the boy, holding his head under water until the lifeguard pulled him away.|$|E

25|$|On September 26, 1898, George {{was born}} as second son to Rose and Morris Gershwine in their second-floor {{apartment}} on Brooklyn's Snediker Avenue. His birth certificate identifies him as Jacob Gershwine, with the surname pronounced 'Gersh-vin' in the Russian and Yiddish immigrant community. He {{had just one}} given name, contrary to the American practice by then of giving children a first and a middle name. He was named after his grandfather, a one time Russian army mechanic. He soon became known as George and changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' {{when he became a}} professional musician, and other family members followed suit. After Ira and George, <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> Arthur Gershwin (1900–1981), and a girl Frances Gershwin (1906–1999) were born into the family.|$|E
25|$|Other {{cases that}} locals can recall include {{that he had}} pulled the snorkel from <b>another</b> <b>boy</b> while diving and had once cut down trees on a neighbour's property. He was {{described}} by teachers as being distant from reality and unemotional. At school he was a disruptive and sometimes violent child who suffered severe bullying by other children. After he was suspended from New Town Primary School in 1977, psychological assessments of Bryant noted his torturing of animals. He returned to school the following year with improved behaviour; however, he persisted in teasing younger children. He was transferred to a special education unit at New Town High School in 1980 where he deteriorated both academically and in behaviour throughout his remaining school years.|$|E
