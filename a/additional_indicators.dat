25|$|The University Ranking by Academic Performance, {{abbreviated}} as URAP, {{was developed}} in the Informatics Institute of Middle East Technical University. Since 2010, it has been publishing annual national and global college and university rankings for top 2000 institutions. The scientometrics measurement of URAP is based on data obtained from the Institute for Scientific Information via Web of Science and inCites. For global rankings, URAP employs indicators of research performance including the number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. In addition to global rankings, URAP publishes regional rankings for universities in Turkey using <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> such as the number of students and faculty members obtained from Center of Measuring, Selection and Placement ÖSYM.|$|E

The inclusion of a soil-related taxon like ground beetles, soil mites, spiders, collembols, nematodes or earthworms would essentially improve {{the significance of the}} BINATS data. They reflect another compartment of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems. The methodology for one of these indicators could easily be adapted to the general survey design. The <b>additional</b> <b>indicator</b> group should be chosen before fixing the financial budget of the repeated BINATS circle in order to guarantee sufficient financial support.|$|R

50|$|WITS now has two sections. One that {{provides}} summary Trade Statistics by Country on total exports, imports, export/import partners, top product groups exported/imported, top exporters and importers in the World. The trade data for each country {{is divided into}} four sections. The first section is the Country Profile Summary and provides summary of the key indicators in Trade, Tariffs, Trade Indicators, Top Export and Import partners {{of the country and}} top exported products. It also provides development indicators from the World Development Indicator (WDI) such as GDP, GNI per capita, Trade Balance and Trade as percentage of GDP. The next section called country has primarily all country level Trade Indicators, and also indicators from WDI on Merchandise and Services Trade, Trade related taxes and GDP, GNI, GDP per capita and more. The next section is by trading partner and provides the top export or import partners of the country with the trade value, partner share. For exports by default it provides Trade Value and Partner Share, <b>Additional</b> <b>indicators</b> like Total HS 6 digit products traded, and Share in Total Products Traded in percentage can be selected. The imports data at partner level by default as Total Trade, Partner Share, Effectively Applied Weighted Average tariff, and MFN Weighted Average Tariff and number of tariff agreements. <b>Additional</b> <b>indicators</b> such as total number of HS 6 digit level products imported, Product Share as percentage, Simple average tariff effectively applied and MFN tariff, number of dutiable and free lines and more can be selected. The final section is by Product Group and this provides details of exports and imports of the country by various standard product groups like by HS Sector, SITC Revision 2 Standard Product Groups or UNCTAD's Stages of processing. By default the Partner is World but it can be changed to a specific country. For exports by default it provides Trade Value and Product Growth and <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> such as Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), World Growth and Product Growth can be selected. For Imports by default it provides Trade Value and Product share in percentage, and effective applied and MFN weighted average tariff is provided for all product groups. <b>Additional</b> <b>indicators</b> such as Simple Average tariff for Effectively Applied an MFN, number of dutiable lines and free lines and much more can be selected. All indicators and country have metadata and the entire metadata can also be viewed in the metadata page. There is a data availability page indicating data availability for each country by year. Many tables and charts can be embedded as widgets in blogs or other html page. This section is also mobile friendly.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} ways to measure a {{creative}} economy. It is possible to use the same indicators as in other economies, such as producer outputs, consumer expenditure, employment and trade. Businesses also use valuation, value chains, price and transactional data. There are <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> of intellectual property. However, measuring intangibles such as ideas, design, brands and style presents a challenge. Furthermore, the nature of work is different, with a high proportion of part-time workers and with many transactions being non-financial.|$|E
50|$|Since that time, Tomball High School has {{increased}} its enrollment to over 2,900 students, and earned a Recognized rating from the Texas Education Agency, which determines state accountability ratings based on data collected via the Academic Excellence Indicator System. Tomball High School has also met Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standards under the federal accountability system. AYP {{ratings are based on}} student performance on the TAKS test, the percentage of students participating in the assessment process, and performance on <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> such as student attendance and graduation rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>indicators</b> {{exist to}} measure the {{sentiment}} specifically on Forex markets. Though the Forex market is decentralized (not traded on a central exchange), various retail Forex brokerage firms publish positioning ratios (similar to the Put/Call ratio) and other data regarding their own clients' trading behavior. Since most retail currency traders are unsuccessful, measures of Forex market sentiment are typically used as contrarian indicators. Some researchers report Internet search data (e.g. Google Trends) to be useful in predicting volatility on foreign currency markets. Internet search data and (relevant) Wikipedia page views data are reported to be useful in cryptocurrency (e.g. BitCoin) prices forecasting.|$|E

50|$|URAP uses 6 main {{indicator}} {{to measure}} the academic performance. These indicators are number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. The raw bibliometric data underlying URAP’s 6 main indicators have highly skewed distribution. To address this issue, the median of the indicators have been used. The Delphi system was conducted {{with a group of}} experts to assign weighting scores to the indicators. Total score of 600 is distributed to indicators. URAP uses <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> for ranking universities in Turkey including the number of students and faculty members.The following table shows the indicators used for global rankings in URAP as of 2014.|$|E
50|$|With {{the breakup}} of the Federation, in search of <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> of {{independent}} and separate national identities, language became a political instrument in virtually all of the new republics. With a boom of neologisms in Croatia, an additional emphasis on Turkisms in the Muslim parts of Bosnia and a privileged position of the Cyrillic script in Serb-inhabited parts of the new states, every state and entity showed a 'nationalization' of the language. The language in Bosnia started developing independently after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in 1992.

5000|$|A {{small number}} of {{professional}} archaeologists cast doubt on Fujimura's finds {{but this was not}} widespread, allowing Fujimura to continue his fraud. A critical paper was published in 1986, noting among other points that [...] "the TL dates from Zazaragi are <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> that something is wrong with the geological context of the artifacts, at least at that site. The dates for Strata 4, 6c, and 8 are totally out of line". In 1990, Michio Okamura published a book on the Paleolithic which debunked the supposed Early Paleolithic culture. Three more papers were published in 1998 and 2000. The thrust of the argument in 2000 was that the problematic paleolithic findings were [...] "odd" [...] compared to other lower and middle paleolithic findings.|$|E
50|$|WHO's {{definition}} of MSP has some {{strengths and weaknesses}} The quantification is an indicator {{and a picture of}} the levels of higher-risk sex in a locale. If those surveyed changed their activity to one sexual partner, the change will be quantified by changes in the indicator. This disadvantage is that though a respondent may reduce the number of MSP in a 12 month period, the indicator will not reflect this change in sexual activity. Even so, decreasing the number of MSP may not indicate a change. Potentially this definition and quantification may {{have a significant impact on}} the pandemic of HIV and used as a measure of program success. WHO recommends that <b>additional</b> <b>indicators</b> that quantify MSP more precisely to capture the reduction in multiple sexual partners in general. According to the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, having multiple sex partners has been quantified to mean that those greater than or equal to age 25 had four or more sexual partners in one year.|$|E

5000|$|Flame is an uncharacteristically large {{program for}} malware at 20 megabytes. It is written partly in the Lua {{scripting}} language with compiled C++ code linked in, and allows other attack modules to be loaded after initial infection. The malware uses five different encryption methods and an SQLite database to store structured information. The method used to inject code into various processes is stealthy, {{in that the}} malware modules do not appear in a listing of the modules loaded into a process and malware memory pages are protected with READ, WRITE and EXECUTE permissions that make them inaccessible by user-mode applications. The internal code has few similarities with other malware, but exploits two of the same security vulnerabilities used previously by Stuxnet to infect systems. [...] The malware determines what antivirus software is installed, then customises its own behaviour (for example, by changing the filename extensions it uses) to reduce the probability of detection by that software. <b>Additional</b> <b>indicators</b> of compromise include mutex and registry activity, such as installation of a fake audio driver which the malware uses to maintain persistence on the compromised system.|$|E

Engagement in critical thinking and deep knowledge can occur through reflective processes. When learners move through the four phases of cognitive presence (triggering, exploration, integration, resolution), the processes of discussion and reflection are important in developing deep understanding. In this article, data from the online discussion archives within a blended teacher-education course are analysed using the cognitive presence indicators from the CoI with the <b>additional</b> <b>indicator</b> of reflection. This study indicates that when instructors structure online discussions appropriately, learners are able to share and document their thinking and reflect on their contributions and the perspectives of others while developing new or deeper knowledge. To facilitate the coding of reflective activities and online posts the researcher proposes modifying the resolution phase of the original cognitive presence coding protocol to include an <b>additional</b> reflection <b>indicator.</b> ...|$|R

Subjects were undergraduate college students at a large midwestern university and were selected for participation on the CPT according to Mr 1 P I profile types. The 2 - 7 - 8 and 8 - 9 profile types served as the schizotypal groups, the 4 - 9 profile type served as the psychiatric control group, and the "inflation-free" profile type served as the normal control group. The 8 - 9 profile type was employed to further {{support the use of}} this profile type as an <b>additional</b> <b>indicator</b> of schizotypy. The CPT task employed a response-reversal technique in responding to stimuli which demanded three levels of processing. Signal detection indices were applied to false alarm rates and hit rates to obtain overall sensitivity level (d') and response criterion level (13). It was hypothesized that the 2 - 7 - 8 and 8 - 9 groups should display similar deficits on d' further supporting the use of the 8 - 9 group as an <b>additional</b> <b>indicator</b> of schizotypy and further supporting a deficit on d' as being a possible trait marker of the schizophrenic state. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between groups on any of the measures; however, group trends indicated that the 2 - 7 - 8 group obtained the highest d', contradicting previous research.
