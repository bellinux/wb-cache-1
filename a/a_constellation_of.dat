25|$|Multiple MIDAS {{satellites}} {{would be}} needed to provide round-the-clock coverage of the huge landmass of the Soviet Union. A booster rocket capable of sending a satellite into geostationary orbit had not yet been developed, and one or a few of these {{might not be able to}} cover all the possible ICBM launch sites within Russia, especially in the far north near the Arctic Circle. Satellites in polar orbits {{would be needed}} to detect launches from across the Soviet Union but due to the nature of the polar orbit, each would have only a brief period of time above the Soviet Union. As the planned capabilities of the satellite changed during the design process, so did the plans for their deployment. A plan completed in January 1959 recommended <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> twenty MIDAS satellites orbiting at an altitude of 1,000 miles while a revised plan, produced later that year, envisioned <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> twelve spacecraft at 2,000-mile altitudes.|$|E

25|$|A {{discovery}} in gamma-ray astronomy {{came in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s from <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> military defense satellites. Detectors on board the Vela satellite series, designed to detect flashes of gamma rays from nuclear bomb blasts, began to record bursts of gamma rays from deep space rather than {{the vicinity of the}} Earth. Later detectors determined that these gamma-ray bursts are seen to last for fractions of a second to minutes, appearing suddenly from unexpected directions, flickering, and then fading after briefly dominating the gamma-ray sky. Studied since the mid-1980s with instruments on board a variety of satellites and space probes, including Soviet Venera spacecraft and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, the sources of these enigmatic high-energy flashes remain a mystery. They appear to come from far away in the Universe, and currently the most likely theory seems to be {{that at least some of}} them come from so-called hypernova explosionssupernovas creating black holes rather than neutron stars.|$|E

Tucana first appeared on a [...] celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756.

[...] However, this story is likely untrue, as the time needed for news of the flag design approved by Congress to travel, followed by construction of such a flag and then its delivery to such a remote location render the story implausible, and the flags known to have been recovered bear no resemblance whatsoever to the United States flag.|$|E
500|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{consists of two}} parts, the anterior (front) and posterior (back) pituitary. Both parts release hormones that control numerous other organs. In pituitary apoplexy, the main initial problem {{is a lack of}} secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, corticotropin), which stimulates the secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland. This occurs in 70% of those with pituitary apoplexy. A sudden lack of cortisol in the body leads to <b>a</b> <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> symptoms called [...] "adrenal crisis" [...] or [...] "Addisonian crisis" [...] (after a complication of Addison's disease, the main cause of adrenal dysfunction and low cortisol levels). The main problems are low blood pressure (particularly on standing), low blood sugars (which can lead to coma) and abdominal pain; the low blood pressure can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, in {{a seminal}} paper, Minsky noted {{that many of}} his fellow [...] "scruffy" [...] {{researchers}} were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something.
