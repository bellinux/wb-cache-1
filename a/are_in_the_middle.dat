5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E

Other Conservatives <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> ground, favouring stances such as looser regulation and decriminalisation of some drugs.

25|$|Second, {{the trail}} is served by two parking lots along 23A, both of which require a walk of at least 0.2 mile (400 m) to reach the trailhead at Bastion Falls, just above 23A at {{a bend in the}} road. Due to both the rugged {{surrounding}} terrain and the limitations placed on Forest Preserve land by the state constitution, New York's Department of Transportation (DOT) has been unable to expand the narrow shoulder {{on either side of the}} road, requiring that visitors walk very close to high-speed traffic, including trucks, some of which <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of descending a pronounced grade. The risk of serious accidents is great. Both DOT and DEC have indicated a willingness to develop a solution that will accommodate their concerns, however this has not happened as of 2006. Some hikers try to avoid this by parking near the Laurel House site or at North-South Lake and following the closed route of the former Escarpment Trail; this is equally risky as it is very near the edge of the falls.|$|E

[...] He added that, unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record. In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will be something to [...] "shuffle your feet" [...] to.|$|E
