40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{empirical}} test of complementarities among delegated <b>authority,</b> accountability, <b>and</b> monitoring, using unique survey {{data collected from}} group　affiliated companies in Japan. The survey provides information about how various decisions are made within business groups, each of which consists of a large core parent firm and its network of affiliated firms such as subsidiaries and related companies. We find some evidence that delegated <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> accountability are complementary, implying that increasing assigned accountability raises the marginal return from increasing delegated authority. We also obtain a stronger result that performance {{is likely to be}} better under the combination of low <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> low accountability or that of high <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> high accountability than under the “mix and match” combinations where one is low and the other high. We then study the effects of monitoring intensity on the authority-accountability pair and find that performance of the firm with the combination of high <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> high accountability is increasing in monitoring intensity, while the combination of low <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> low accountability is not. This result is consistent with the theoretical hypothesis that increasing monitoring intensity raises the marginal return from increasing delegated <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> accountability...|$|R
