40|$|Use of {{observed}} wind profiles, such {{as those}} obtained from ascent or descent <b>aircraft</b> <b>soundings,</b> for {{the identification of the}} expected roll modes is hindered by the fact that these modes are able to modify the wind profiles. When such modified wind profiles are utilized to estimate the critical values of the dynamic and thermodynamic forcing rates, large errors in the preferred orientation angles and aspect ratios of the rolls may result. Nonlinear analysis of a 14 coefficient spectral model of roll circulations shows that the primary modification of the background wind is the addition of a linear component. When the linear profile having the correct amount of shear is subtracted from the observed cross-roll winds, then the pre-roll wind profile can be estimated. A preliminary test of this hypothesis is given for a case in which cloud streets were observed during FIRE...|$|R

In particular, the contribution of various events to the total flux is revealed without a priori specification of sampling criteria.

Observations by an upward-looking three-channel microwave radiometer on San Nicolas Island also show the - 5 / 3 power-law in total integrated liquid water, suggesting that the largest-scale TM brightness variations are primarily due to variations in the liquid water.

The following specific microgravity combustion phenomena are considered: stretched flames, flamefront instabilities, flammability limits and near-limit phenomena of gaseous premixed flames; structure, stability and soot processes in gaseous nonpremixed flames; flame propagation, smoldering and materials synthesis in heterogeneous premixed flames; flame spread, gasification and combustion in heterogeneous nonpremixed flames; flame-inhibiting atmospheres, fire detection and extinguishment in spacecraft environments; and ground-based (drop tower and <b>aircraft),</b> <b>sounding</b> rocket and space-based (shuttle, space station) microgravity combustion research facilities that are either available or anticipated.

40|$|The {{airborne}} NPOESS <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Sounding</b> Test-bed Interferometer (NAST-I) {{has flown}} on numerous flights under the Aqua satellite {{in order to}} validate AIRS radiance measurements and profile retrievals. The NAST-I is an excellent AIRS airborne validation tool since it possesses relatively high spectral and spatial resolution as well as relatively low radiance measurement noise, especially after the data are spatially averaged to the footprint size of the AIRS sensor. The results of these airborne missions {{have shown that the}} AIRS calibration validates well against airborne interferometer radiance measurements 1. Here, it is shown that the retrievals obtained using the same retrieval algorithm are in general agreement, although the airborne NAST-I result possesses higher vertical resolution as a consequence of it’s higher spectral resolution and lower “effective ” radiance noise level. The “effective ” radiance noise level {{is a function of the}} single spectral sample radiance measurement noise, the number of spectral channels used for the retrieval, and the number of spatial samples averaged to produce the final profile result. For the NAST-I aircraft instrument, the effective radiance noise level is extremely small, particularly after reducing the horizontal linear resolution to that of the satellite AIRS instrument (i. e., ~ 14 km for AIRS as opposed to ~ 2 km for NAST-I), and as a result its relatively large spectral range and high spectral resolution (i. e., NAST-I possess nearly four times the number of spectral channels as does the AIRS).

As a result, {{an understanding of}} microgravity fluid physics is essential {{in the development of}} many space technologies ranging from life support systems on the International Space Station to propellant management devices in spacecraft fuel tanks. Microgravity fluids research has been conducted for decades in drop towers, parabolic <b>aircraft,</b> <b>sounding</b> rockets, the Space Shuttle, and the International Space Station. Recently, flight opportunities for microgravity research experiments are becoming available on commercial suborbital vehicles. Advantages of commercial suborbital space flight include low-cost access to the microgravity environment, multiple launch opportunities in a single day, access to experimental hardware up to minutes before launch, and access to experimental data immediately upon landing. In addition, the initial development of many commercial suborbital vehicles was largely for space tourism meaning that safety requirements for manned missions are in place making autonomous control unnecessary and allowing hands-on experimentation during flight. Suborbital space flights also provide significantly more low-gravity time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes) compared to current drop towers. ^ The emerging market for microgravity research in commercial suborbital space-flight has provided an opportunity to explore critical wetting in a three-dimensional geometry. This thesis discusses the design of a microgravity experiment scheduled to launch on New Shepard vehicle designed by Blue Origin, LLC. The experiment includes a 5 -inch diameter spherical tank and two rotating vane structures of different thicknesses The design of the tank and vane structures was completed using the Surface Evolverwhich is a computational tool used to model steady-state low-gravity capillary fluids problems. The critical wetting phenomenon in the gap between the vane and the tank wall was studied. ^ The results obtained from Surface Evolver conclude that the capillary behavior of the liquid in the gap is significantly affected by differences in vane thickness, vane width, contact angle, and the non-circular shape of the vane, or vane spiral. Decreasing the thickness of only one vane reduces the liquid climb height in the vane gap of the thinner vane while the liquid climb height increases in the vane gap of the thicker vane. The same result is observed when the vane width is decreased. Increasing the contact angle increases the liquid climb height in the thick vane gap and decreases the liquid climb height in the thin vane gap for vane angles less than 10 °. Lastly, increasing the vane gap by increasing the vane spiral causes the liquid climb height in the thick vane gap to decrease while the liquid climb height in the thin vane gap closely follows the baseline until about 10 °. ^ The final vane design was chosen based on the conclusions of this work. The thicker vane has a thickness of 0. 1, the thinner vane has a thickness of 0. 05, and both vanes have a width of 0. 2. The vane thicknesses and width are nondimensionalized by the radius of the tank. The vane spiral rate was chosen to be 0. 01 rad, the contact angle of the test fluid was determined to be 40 ° and 25...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — New {{wireless}} communications systems at 60 GHz are a promising solution to reach Giga-bit data rates for short range communications, e. g., for in-flight-entertainment (IFE) systems. For shadowed 60 GHz IFE systems, high resolution and multi-antenna time-varying channel characterisation are mandatory. This paper presents the first wideband 60 GHz real-time multi-antenna channel sounder (MCS) and measurement results within an Airbus- 340 aircraft cabin. The MCS is a 3 GHz bandwidth {{system based on}} a modular architecture with 2 real-time acquisition channels enabled with a dynamic range up to 40 dB. This system architecture allowed the study of different in-cabin access point (AP) configurations and the inclusion of correlated shadowing by human bodies (SHB) for macro-diversity implementations. The frequency, phase and impulse response of the MCS has been tested based on back-to-back calibration data and its dynamic range verified. As example of the 60 GHz MCS application, the delay spread and the coherent bandwidth have been calculated for the in-cabin channel. Besides, comparisons between static and time-variant conditions are presented.

Hand analyses of height, temperature, and dewpoint, and cross-sections of 6 and 6, were prepared using <b>aircraft</b> and <b>sounding</b> data through the warm-frontal region {{in order to}} document the vertical structure. The {{results showed that the}} initial disturbance formed under a region of strong upper-level confluence between a southern jet streak and an approaching upper-level short-wave from the northwest. Upper-level frontogenesis associated with the confluent flow was strong enough to produce tropopause folding and stratospheric extrusion as low as 700 mb about 750 km upstream from the surface low prior to rapid deepening. The mesoscale analyses during the initial occlusion phase showed the upper-level temperature and moisture patterns spiraling around the low center with strong warm air advection occuring under a pocket of cold air aloft, producing significant convective instabilty. The cross-sections of 6 f throughout the rapid deepening period showed unstable conditions, which suggests that moist potential instability in the warm frontal region was a factor in the rapid development of this storm.

Toward these ends, a series of lidar aerosol measurements in conjunction with balloon and <b>aircraft</b> temperature <b>soundings</b> were taken at a site in El Monte, and in a mobile mode along a 90 -mile freeway loop between El Monte, Santa Monica, and Long Beach.

The lidar-derived mixing depths are well correlated (within 100 m) with daytime temperature inversions. Other significant features shown by the lidar data include large Basin-wide mixing-depth variations, waves with amplitudes of 200 - 300 m and wavelengths of 1000 - 1500 m on the lower aerosol layer, and apparent aerosol "chimneys" with overrunning in the vicinity of convergence zones...|$|R

These facilities, which include drop towers, drop tubes, <b>aircraft,</b> and <b>sounding</b> rockets are able to provide a low gravity environment (gravitational levels that range from 10 (exp - 2) g to 10 (exp - 6) g) by creating a free fall or semi-free fall condition where {{the force of gravity}} on an experiment is offset by its linear acceleration during the 'fall' (drop or parabola). The low gravity condition obtained on the ground is {{the same as that of}} an orbiting spacecraft which is in a state of perpetual free fall. The gravitational levels and associated duration times associated with the full spectrum of reduced gravity facilities including spaced-based facilities are summarized. Even though ground-based facilities offer a relatively short experiment time, this available test time has been found to be sufficient to advance the scientific understanding of many phenomena and to provide meaningful hardware tests during the flight experiment development process. Also, since experiments can be quickly repeated in these facilities, multistep phenomena that have longer characteristic times associated with them can sometimes be examined in a step-by-step process. There is a large body of literature which has reported the study results achieved through using reduced-gravity data obtained from the facilities...|$|R
40|$|The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), to be {{launched}} in 1982, is discussed. It will systematically survey the entire sky over {{a large percentage of}} the infrared spectrum, in the wavelength region of 8 to 120 microns, at sensitivities a hundred times greater than previously achieved from high-altitude observatories, <b>aircraft,</b> balloons or <b>sounding</b> rockets. The Scientific Data Analysis System (SDAS), an off-line data processing facility, is examined. Its primary function is to produce a catalog of inertially fixed infrared-emitting point sources (mainly stars and galaxies) observed during the IRAS survey. Details for source detection and confirmation are given. It is estimated that the catalog will contain approximately a million objects having a brightness of 10 amtowatts per square centimeter or greater; 125, 000 SDAS detections, if spurious events of signal-to-noise ratios greater than 2. 5 are included, will be made every day...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{facilities}} {{are available for}} microgravity combustion experiments: <b>aircraft,</b> drop towers, <b>sounding</b> rockets, the space shuttle, and, in the future, the International Space Station (ISS). Acceleration disturbances or g-jitter about the background level of reduced gravity exist in all these microgravity facilities. While g-jitter is routinely measured, a quantitative comparison {{of the quality of}} g-jitter among the different microgravity facilities, in terms of its affects on combustion experiments, has not been compiled. Low frequency g-jitter (< 1 Hz) has been repeatedly observed to disturb a number of combustion systems. Guidelines regarding tolerable levels of acceleration disturbances for combustion experiments have been developed for use in the design of ISS experiments. The validity of these guidelines, however, remains unknown. In this project a transient, 3 -D numerical model is under development to simulate the effects of realistic g-jitter on a number of combustion systems. The measured acceleration vector or some representation of it can be used as input to the simulation...|$|R
