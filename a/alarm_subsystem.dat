40|$|People {{who suffer}} from hearing {{impairment}} caused by illness, age or extremely noisy environments are constantly {{in danger of being}} hit or knocked down by fast moving objects behind them when they have no companion or augmented sensory system to warn them. In this paper, we propose the General Moving Object Alarm System (GMOAS), a system focused on aiding the safe mobility of people under these circumstances. The GMOAS is a wearable haptic device that consists of two main subsystems: (i) a moving object monitoring subsystem that uses laser range data to detect and track approaching objects, and (ii) an <b>alarm</b> <b>subsystem</b> that warns the user of possibly dangerous approaching objects by triggering tactile vibrations on an “alarm necklace”. For moving object monitoring, we propose a simple yet efficient solution to monitor the approaching behavior of objects. Compared with previous work in motion detection and tracking, we are not interested in specific objects but any type of approaching object that might harm the user. To this extent, we define a boundary in the laser range data where the objects are monitored. Within this boundary a fan-shape grid is constructed to obtain an evenly distributed spatial partitioning of the data. These partitions are efficiently clustered into continuous objects which are then tracked through time using an object association algorithm based on updating a deviation matrix that represents angle, distance and size variations of the objects. The speed of the tracked objects is monitored throughout the algorithm. When the speed of an approaching object surpasses the safety threshold, the alarm necklace is triggered indicating the approaching direction of the fast moving object. The alarm necklace is equipped with three motors that can indicate five directions with respect to the user: left, back, right, left-back and right-back. We performed three types of outdoor experiments (object passing, approaching and crossing) that empirically verified the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we analyzed the time and direction response based on neck vibrations. The statistical analysis (including hypothesis test) suggests that the chosen alarm necklace can provide a rapid indication for a quick human response...|$|E

The management system consists of security <b>subsystem</b> (access control, <b>alarm</b> control), comfort <b>subsystem</b> (temperature, etc.), intelligence subsystem (multimedia, houseware). The design solving process {{is based on}} Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD) approach: (1) design of a tree-like system model, (2) generation of design alternatives for leaf nodes of the system model, (3) Bottom-Up process: (i) multicriteria selection of design alternatives for system parts/components and (ii) composing the selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account ordinal quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility).

40|$|Abstract—Controller Area Network (CAN) is {{the most}} widely used {{protocol}} in the automotive domain. Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial–of–service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus–based CAN are <b>alarming,</b> because safety–critical <b>subsystems</b> (e. g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus–based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus–based CAN, but are detected and contained on router–based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e. g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems. I...|$|R
