5|$|Lygon's successor, the {{politician}} Rufus Isaacs, the Marquess of Reading, became the Lord Warden in 1934, holding jovial family gatherings there. His wife, Stella, attempted to restore Wellington's old bedroom to its earlier appearance during the Duke's tenure and, {{as part of}} this project, the 4th Duke of Wellington agreed to send the original contents of the room back to the castle, where they still remain. The politician Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon, became Lord Warden in 1936, followed by Sir Winston Churchill who followed him in 1941 during the Second World War. Churchill noted to the Minister of Works and Buildings that he had told King George V on taking up the position that he doubted that {{he would be able to}} live at Walmer Castle during the war, as it was within range of the German artillery along the French coast, or indeed that he would <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> live there afterwards, and for that reason he hoped that the state would maintain the castle and gardens, and decide what use it should be put to after the war.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover {{in the hope that}} the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this period that {{advances}} {{were made in the}} development of buses that improved their reliability and introduced innovations such as the pneumatic tyre. The Board, which by this time had come to the realisation {{that it would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> significantly extend the tramway network, purchased some additional buses to provide services in areas not served by the trams. These developments also led to the rise of the private bus operators, which were able to provide services in areas not covered by the Board, and later to directly challenge the Board itself. After introducing a number of measures to directly combat the private operators, legislative means were employed to deal with them.|$|E
25|$|Juan Jimenez, {{software}} {{manager for}} Sony Spain, told Spanish gaming site The Vault that Uncharted 3 would {{make use of}} the PlayStation Network Pass, making it the second game to carry the feature following Resistance 3. As is standard, a one-time code will be provided with copies of Uncharted 3 for first time buyers giving them immediate access to online multiplayer features, whereas second-hand purchasers of the title will have to pay extra for online play. When asked why the developers implemented the pass system, game director Justin Richmond replied, that without the money from Sony's PSN Pass it wouldn't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> include as much online content as it has with Uncharted 3, and would possibly have to separate the online and offline content into separate products.|$|E

50|$|The fledgling PlayStation market {{remained}} a difficult nut to crack. Just as {{the transition from}} 8-bit to 16-bit had escalated development costs and required a significant expansion of resources, so too did the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit platforms. PlayStation development kits were notoriously expensive. Graftgold were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> enough <b>to</b> allow them to begin development on International MotoX and a PS1 conversion of Rainbow Islands, but they couldn't <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> develop any other titles.

500|$|Filming {{finished}} in August 2008 in Moscow, Russia; {{it was the}} first time in series history where filming took place outside the United Kingdom; producer Katie Swinden stated that Spooks is usually [...] "London-orientated," [...] including when it comes to filming scenes set in other countries, and it usually does not take place outside the confines of the M25, an orbital motorway which encircles the UK's capital. However, the producers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> shoot in another country. A small crew were used to save costs. Armitage and Norris were the only two of the main actors who participated in the shoot. However, the main problem with filming in Moscow was of the 30 plus degree heat, and the actors had to wear winter coats because the episodes were set during the colder months.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 Hans-Werner Sinn, {{president}} of German Ifo Institute for Economic Research, {{called for a}} debt relief for Greece. In addition, economists from London School of Economics suggested a debt relief similar to the London agreement. In 1953, private sector lenders as well as governments agreed to write off about half of West Germany’s outstanding debt; {{this was followed by}} [...] the beginning of Germany's [...] "economic miracle" [...] (or [...] ). According to this agreement, West Germany had to make repayments only when it was running a trade surplus, that is [...] "when it had earned the money to pay up, rather than having to borrow more, or dip into its foreign currency reserves. Its repayments were also limited to 3% of export earnings."

50|$|Dart {{was asked}} to design a {{building}} with a budget of $120,000, which the church was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> thanks <b>to</b> a $45,000 cash fund and a $20,000 grant from the National Council of the Protestant Church. Dart's initial design far exceeded this budget with large, ornate stained glass windows that cost $10,000 each, and the parish swiftly rejected it, preferring a more modest, minimalist design. Drawing upon this information, Dart produced a second custom design that was eventually agreed to by the congregation's leadership after discussions that lasted several years.|$|R
