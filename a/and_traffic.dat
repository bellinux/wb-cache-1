40|$|Irregular {{migration}} by {{unaccompanied minors}} {{has become an}} increasingly prevalent global issue. Unaccompanied minors who have fled their countries of origin, often due to persecution, violence, or poverty, present an opportunity for migrant smugglers and human traffickers who exploit their unique vulnerabilities and dependence. Smuggling <b>and</b> <b>trafficking</b> are often fluid, interrelated phenomena, making practical distinctions difficult. This article explores the protection of smuggled <b>and</b> <b>trafficked</b> unaccompanied minors under the United Nations Protocols against the Smuggling of Migrants <b>and</b> <b>Trafficking</b> in Persons. While each Protocol includes mandatory provisions pertaining to criminalization, it explains that neither Protocol adequately protects unaccompanied minors, addresses their unique vulnerabilities, or accounts for the often-blurred distinction between minors who are smuggled migrants and minors who are victims of trafficking. In light of these issues, this article argues that a coherent, protection-based approach, founded on international human rights and refugee law, is necessary. This article outlines rights and principles integral to such an approach, and analyses their particular application to smuggled <b>and</b> <b>trafficked</b> unaccompanied minors. It posits that the emphasis on criminal, preventative, and border control aspects of smuggling <b>and</b> <b>trafficking</b> comes {{at the expense of}} more nuanced understandings of the experiences and vulnerabilities of smuggled <b>and</b> <b>trafficked</b> unaccompanied minors, despite the pressing and evident need for a more substantive framework for their protection...|$|R
5|$|According to the {{government}} of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and San Fernando. In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the main highway through the city was closed, <b>and</b> <b>traffic</b> on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E

There is no interchange further north for M-72; access to that highway is provided through the business loop.

5|$|Alongside the {{twinning}} of the skyway, the QEW was widened {{to eight}} lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway2) in Burlington, and to six lanes {{north to the}} Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs <b>and</b> <b>traffic</b> cameras were added {{to create a new}} traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built {{at the same time to}} relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.|$|E

5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, <b>and</b> <b>traffic</b> between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E

The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison produced an F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging one house and one small camper. A microburst in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm hit two houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere. Allison also produced moderate rainfall in the state, mainly ranging from 3 to 5inches (75 to 125mm). The rainfall caused drainage <b>and</b> <b>traffic</b> problems.
