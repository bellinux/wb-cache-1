40|$|Background and Aims: Oleoylethanolamide {{and several}} other N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), e. g. linoleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, have <b>anorectic</b> {{properties}} in rats, and prolonged intake of a high-fat diet decreases the levels of the <b>anorectic</b> NAEs in jejunum. Jejunal <b>anorectic</b> NAEs are thought {{to add to the}} control of food intake via activation of PPARalpha and the vagus nerve. The fat-induced decrease may explain part of the hyperphagic effect of high-fat diets. In the present study, we investigated 1) whether the reduced levels of <b>anorectic</b> NAEs were reversible in rats, 2) whether mice respond to dietary fat (olive oil) by reducing levels of <b>anorectic</b> NAEs, and 3) whether dietary non-esterified oleic acid also can decrease levels of <b>anorectic</b> NAEs in mice. We are searching for the fat sensor in the intestine, which mediates the decreased levels of <b>anorectic</b> NAEs. Methods: Male rats and mice were fed diets high (45 energy % fat) in either triacylglycerol or free fatty acids for 7 – 14 days, and jejunal NAE and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) levels were determined by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: In rats, reduced levels of <b>anorectic</b> NAEs could be reversed after 3 days from changing the diet from high-fat to chow. Corresponding NAPE levels tended to show the same changes. In mice, jejunal levels of <b>anorectic</b> NAEs were also reduced when fed a high-fat diet. In addition, we found that non-esterified oleic acid were also able to reduce levels o...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-seven <b>anorectic</b> and bulimic {{males and}} 142 <b>anorectic</b> and bulimic females treated on an eating {{disorders}} unit were compared. Significantly more male patients reported experiencing sexual isolation, sexual inactivity, and conflicted homosexuality. (AmJ Psychiatry 141 : 989 - 990, 1984) A norexia nervosa and bulimia, two eating disor-ders of strikingly increasing prevalence in recent years, are {{generally regarded as}} primarily affecting girls and women. It is estimated that males make up only 4 %- 14 % of the <b>anorectic</b> population (1, 2). The proportion of male bulimics has been studied less often but has been estimated as 0. 4 %-S % of the bulimic population in a university setting (3, 4). Because of the relative rarity of these disorders in males, less {{is known about the}} characteristics of boys and men afflicted with these disorders. The Eating Disorders Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital was established in 1981 to evaluate and treat <b>anorectic</b> and bulimic patients. During the unit’s first 2 years 27 males (8. 9 % of patients seen) were diagnosed as being <b>anorectic</b> or bulimic. We report on the demographic and clinical data from all male patients evaluated during that time. METHOD We studied 13 <b>anorectic</b> and 14 bulimic male pa-tients who were evaluated on the unit. <b>Anorectic</b> males ranged in age from 16 to 32 years (mean= 23. 6 years), and bulimic males ranged in age from 13 to 41 years (mean= 26. 7 years).

40|$|Relationships between {{eating and}} affective {{disorders}} remain complex and unclear. Brain glucose metabolism of <b>anorectic</b> patients {{has been demonstrated}} to be reduced both globally and regionally, with a particular relative hypometabolism in the parietal cortex. To explore the possible influence of weight loss or depressive symptomatology on brain metabolism, we studied age- and sex-matched low-weight <b>anorectic</b> and depressed patients, normal-weight depressed patients, and healthy volunteers. Absolute global and regional glucose activity levels were reduced in low-weight patients, with the lowest values being found for <b>anorectic</b> patients. In relative values, <b>anorectic</b> patients showed a significant parietal hypometabolism in comparison to control subjects while they had higher metabolism in the caudate nuclei {{when compared with the}} other groups. Absolute hypometabolism of glucose seems to be a consequence of low weight as it was found in both low-weight <b>anorectic</b> and low-weight depressive patients. In addition, absolute glucose values were significantly correlated with body mass index in all subjects.

The serotonin receptors influence various biological and neurological processes such as aggression, anxiety, appetite, cognition, learning, memory, mood, nausea, sleep, and thermoregulation. The serotonin receptors are the target of a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, <b>anorectics,</b> antiemetics, gastroprokinetic agents, antimigraine agents, hallucinogens, and entactogens.|$|E
50|$|Mechanisms {{controlling}} appetite are {{a potential}} target {{for weight loss}} drugs. Appetite control mechanisms seem to strongly counteract undereating, whereas they appear weak to control overeating. Early <b>anorectics</b> were fenfluramine and phentermine. A more recent addition is sibutramine which increases serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the central nervous system, but had to be withdrawn from the market when it was shown to have an adverse cardiovascular risk profile. Similarly, the appetite suppressant rimonabant (a cannabinoid receptor antagonist) had to be withdrawn when it was linked with worsening depression and increased risk of suicide. Recent reports on recombinant PYY 3-36 suggest that this agent may contribute to weight loss by suppressing appetite.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of currently approved antidepressants act predominantly or exclusively as MRIs, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), {{and almost all}} of the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Many psychostimulants used either as <b>anorectics</b> or in the treatment of [...] also behave as MRIs. Additionally, psychostimulants acting as MRIs that affect dopamine such as cocaine and methylphenidate are often abused as recreational drugs. As a result, many of them have become controlled substances, which in turn has resulted in the clandestine synthesis of a vast array of designer drugs for the purpose of bypassing drug laws, a prime example of such is the mixed monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent mephedrone.|$|E

According to Nilsson (2006) in a paper on 5-HT2C receptor agonists as potential <b>anorectics,</b> [...] "The (+)-enantiomer of this compound showed ... affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki) 25 nM) ... and was 40-fold selective over the 5-HT2A receptor in receptor binding studies.

5000|$|Stimulants {{have been}} used in {{medicine}} for many conditions including obesity, sleep disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, asthma, nasal congestion and now controversially as anesthetics.

[...] Drugs used to treat sleep disorders such as excessive daytime sleepiness are called eugeroics and include notable stimulants such as modafinil. [...] Stimulants are used in impulse control disorders such as ADHD and off-label in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder to increase energy, focus and elevate mood. [...] Stimulants such as epinephrine, [...] theophylline and salbutamol orally {{have been used}} to treat asthma, but inhaled adrenergic drugs are now preferred due to less systemic side effects.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The International Narcotics Control Board {{released}} its 2005 annual report, highlighting the Brazil population {{as one of}} the largest consumers of <b>anorectics.</b> In Brazil, the National Health Surveillance Agency issued the resolution RDC 58 / 2007 in order to control the prescription and sale of such drugs. In Belém, the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon region, this resolution came into force in 2008, leading to inspections of drugstores and magistral pharmacies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the consumption of psychotropic anorectic drugs and the impact of RDC 58 / 2007 on the prescription and dispensing of <b>anorectics</b> in drugstores and magistral pharmacies in Belém. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective quantitative and descriptive study was conducted of records from the Municipal Department of Health Surveillance of Belém, for 2005 to 2008. The differences in findings were regarded significant when p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 1, 641 balance sheets of drugstores and magistral pharmacies were analyzed. Amfepramone was the most dispensed medication, followed by fenproporex and mazindol. The highest consumption of <b>anorectics</b> occurred in magistral pharmacies. In 2008, there was a significant reduction in dispensing of <b>anorectics,</b> in drugstores as well as in magistral pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there was a decrease in the dispensing of <b>anorectics</b> after RDC 58 / 2007 came into force, and that the magistral pharmacies dispensed more of these drugs.
