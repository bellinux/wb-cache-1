500|$|In July 1947 Dr. J. J. Durrett, {{director}} of the Medical Advisory Division of the Federal Trade Commission, wrote to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking them to investigate Reich's claims about {{the health benefits of}} orgone. The FDA assigned an investigator to the case, who learned that Reich had built 250 accumulators. The FDA concluded that they were dealing with a [...] "fraud of the first magnitude." [...] According to Sharaf, the FDA suspected a sexual racket of some kind; questions were asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> associated with orgonomy and [...] "what was done with them."

500|$|The song is 5 minutes, 52 seconds long, {{though the}} {{originally}} released version {{was less than}} 3 minutes. The song is built on a soulful sample of Smokey Robinson's quiet storm recording [...] "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow", with an extended guitar solo. The song features a synth-heavy breakdown, complete with guitar riffs, before Ross arrives, spitting: [...] "I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders/ Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired/ Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the lord's ladder/ We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter." [...] It is the only album track without production by West, but features his characteristic style of manipulating the pitch and tempo of classic soul samples. West raps in a flow {{similar to that of}} rapper Nas, commenting <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who have wronged him in the past and his struggles with religion. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times commented that the track reveals West's true feelings on women; ...|$|E
500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always {{got to take a}} step back and let the men shine. And in this, it's <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period for the rest of the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the letters}} was from Bannon, asking for {{professional}} assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day I {{have no idea why}} she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historians, such as Dra. Delma S. Arrigoitia, {{have written}} books and {{documented}} the contributions that Puerto Rican women {{have made to}} society.

In 2012, she published her book [...] "Introduccion a la Historia de la Moda en Puerto Rico". The book, which was requested by the Puerto Rican high fashion designer Carlota Alfaro, covers over 500 years of history of the fashion industry in Puerto Rico. Arrigoitia is working on a book <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who have served in the Puerto Rican Legislature, as requested by the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, Jenniffer González. Her work is not only limited to the contributions that Puerto Rican women have made to society, she authored books that cover the life and works of some of Puerto Rico's most prominent politicians of the early 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, Smith's career flourished. She {{illustrated}} a number of books, magazines, and created an advertisement for Ivory soap. Her works were published in Scribner's, Harper's Bazaar, Harper's Weekly, and St. Nicholas Magazine. She won an award for Child Washing. Green, Smith, and Oakley became known as [...] "The Red Rose Girls" [...] after the Red Rose Inn in Villanova, Pennsylvania where they lived and worked together for four years beginning in the early 1900s. They leased the inn where they were joined by Oakley's mother, Green's parents, and Henrietta Cozens, who managed the gardens and inn. Alice Carter created a book <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> entitled [...] for an exhibition of their work at the Norman Rockwell Museum.

2500|$|The writers {{felt that}} by killing Dixie, it was {{unexpected}} and went beyond [...] "just being <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of Fusion". Killing Dixie was {{to send a}} message that anyone could be the next to die. [...] "In order for a story like this to have real impact, it's not just about the reaction of our environment {{to the people who are}} lost," [...] Carruthers said. [...] "You have to understand that it can affect anybody, you know? It's not just the girls in Fusion who you only see once a week. It's people who are pivotal to the environment, as well. I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't undercut what the Fusion girls have meant to the canvas, particularly those three characters who've been attacked , but a character with as much history as Dixie.... It shows that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. By jumping off that diving board, not knowing what's at the bottom of the pool, you've now taken the story to a whole new level." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first United States all-female {{team was}} led by Jones in 1969. Her team, which {{included}} the first women to {{set foot on the}} South Pole, were used by the navy as a publicity stunt, [...] "paraded around" [...] and called [...] "Powderpuff explorers". The first United States woman to step into in the Antarctic interior in 1970 was engineer Irene C Peden, who also faced various barriers to her working on the continent. Peden describes how a [...] "mythology had been created <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who'd gone to the coast -- that they had been a problem," [...] and that since they had not published their work within the year, they were [...] "heavily criticized." [...] Men in the Navy in charge of approving her trip to Antarctica were [...] "dragging their feet", citing that there were not women's bathrooms available and that without another female companion, she {{would not be allowed to}} go. The admiral in charge of transportation to Antarctica suggested that Peden was trying to go there for adventure, or to find a husband, rather than for her research. Despite her setbacks, including not receiving critical equipment in Antarctica, Peden's research on the continent was successful.|$|E
2500|$|The {{employment}} of the disenfranchised female as visual icon within {{the art world}} {{is a fact that}} feminist critics have diagnosed, as the avant-garde's testing of cultural limits, where the female body, as symptomatic of a visual regime where [...] "Woman" [...] serves as [...] "the very ground of representation, both object and support of a desire which, intimately bound up with power and creativity, is the moving force of culture and history." [...] The ability of male artists to form new expressive modes of representation filled with dynamic power is not a new concept within art history; Duncan in particular emphasizes and exposes the relationship between art historians and the avant-garde painters of the post modern era in that art historians emphasize the notion: “that avant-garde art consists of so many movements of individual artistic freedom, a freedom evidenced in the artist’s capacity for innovation” and in this freedom both artist and historian are freed to analyze and construct work in a larger structure without recognizing the social constraints and responsibilities of the past and their impact on contemporary society. Duncan questions where does this innovation arise? Is it completely unmotivated? A gift from God? We may never know. Picasso in discussing the work was often resistant to acknowledge any guidance in context; favouring instead to address it in a way which ranged from vague, humorous and sarcastic. For example, when “speaking to Kahnweiler in December 1933, Picasso recalled the jokes he and his friends bandied <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> in the Demoiselles painting, identifying one of them as Picasso's girlfriend, Fernande, another as Marie Laurencin, a third as the grandmother of his poet friend Max Jacob-"all in a brothel in Avignon!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
