5000|$|ICAO also assigns 3-letter airline codes (versus the more-familiar 2-letter IATA codes—for example, UAL vs. UA for United Airlines). ICAO also {{provides}} telephony designators to aircraft operators worldwide, a one- or two-word designator {{used on the}} radio, usually, but not always, similar to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>operator</b> <b>name.</b> For example, the identifier for Japan Airlines International is JAL and the designator is Japan Air, but Aer Lingus is EIN and Shamrock. Thus, a Japan Airlines flight numbered 111 would be written as [...] "JAL111" [...] and pronounced [...] "Japan Air One One One" [...] on the radio, while a similarly numbered Aer Lingus would be written as [...] "EIN111" [...] and pronounced [...] "Shamrock One One One". In the US, FAA practices require the digits of the flight number to be spoken in group format ("Japan Air One Eleven" [...] in the above example) while individual digits are used for the aircraft tail number used for unscheduled civil flights.|$|E
