5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps before they <b>are</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data {{when they are}} requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials <b>are</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} <b>are</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
