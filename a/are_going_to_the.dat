5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|Tina and Louise's aunt Gayle (Megan Mullally) {{has bought}} them tickets to an {{upcoming}} concert by the popular boy band Boyz 4 Now. Tina is excited, but Louise, who dislikes boy bands, only agrees {{to go at}} the insistence of her mother Linda (John Roberts). Gene has qualified for a regional tablescaping competition, which Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and Linda escort him to. Louise rejoices after a pet emergency leaves Gayle unable to bring the sisters to the concert, but reluctantly agrees to help find another ride after seeing Tina's disappointment. They hitch a ride with Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) and his older cousin Leslie (Jack McBrayer), who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concert to sell bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs. Bob and Linda later meet the arrogant father of a fellow competitor named Oscar Anthony, which drives them to push Gene to win.|$|E
25|$|New {{migration}} patterns have appeared. Washington has a steadily declining black population, due to many African Americans' {{leaving the}} city for suburbs. At the same time, the city's Caucasian and Hispanic populations have steadily increased. Since 2000 {{there has been a}} 7.3% decrease in the African-American population, and a 17.8% increase in the European-American population. In addition, many African Americans <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South in a New Great Migration, because of family ties, increased opportunities and lower cost of living. They still are a majority in the city, comprising 51 percent of the population.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, {{schooling}} within Hattert ended altogether. Since then, schoolchildren have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{primary school}} in Müschenbach, while secondary-level students have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hauptschule and Realschule in Hachenburg {{as well as}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> private Gymnasium run by the Marienstatt Cistercian Abbey.|$|R
25|$|A {{high level}} of {{paranoia}} is present throughout the film with the visual manifestation of corporate power, omnipresent police, probing lights; and in the power over the individual represented particularly by genetic programming of the replicants. Control over the environment is seen {{on a large scale}} but also with how animals are created as mere commodities. This oppressive backdrop clarifies why many people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> off-world colonies, which clearly parallels the migration to the Americas. The popular 1980s prediction of the United States being economically surpassed by Japan is reflected in the domination of Japanese culture and corporations in the advertising of LA 2019. The film also makes extensive use of eyes and manipulated images to call into question reality and our ability to perceive it.|$|E
25|$|Poirot visits Mertonshire, {{where an}} old friend, Lady Carmichael, gives him {{details of the}} Grant family. All the girls <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bad as their father cannot control them. They keep company with Hawker, who has an {{unpleasant}} reputation, as does another of his 'lady friends', Mrs Larkin. Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in an armchair with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks {{the news of the}} drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble. Leaving the room, Poirot clumsily trips against his host.|$|E
25|$|The pair meet Wichita (Emma Stone) and {{her younger}} sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters are con artists, and trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons by pretending that Little Rock was {{infected}} by the disease, then steal their Escalade. The two men find a yellow Hummer H2 loaded with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus lashes out in anger that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them. The sisters reveal that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles, an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus decides to accompany the others to California. Along the trip, Columbus persists in trying to impress and woo Wichita.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the Tripods was {{described}} by Spielberg as [...] "graceful," [...] with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing {{a tribute to the}} original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself. The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the [...] "contradiction" [...] of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a [...] "terrestrial buoyance", in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like [...] "scary ballet dancers". [...] Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three – the Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each. Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering [...] "Steven {{wanted to make sure that}} these creatures were 150 feet tall", as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs, and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, [...] "this was going to be a horror movie for kids". So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. Digital [...] birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that [...] "you don't know if these birds <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away." ...|$|E

The rocket bus featured in this book has become a symbol of the Magic School Bus series.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have claimed}} that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority (PA) had pre-planned the Intifada. They often quote a speech made in December 2000 by Imad Falouji, the PA Communications Minister at the time, where he {{explains}} that the Intifada had been planned since Arafat's return from the Camp David Summit in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit. He stated that the Intifada [...] "was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from Camp David negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions". David Samuels quotes Mamduh Nofal, former military commander of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who supplies more evidence of pre-28 September military preparations. Nofal recounts that Arafat [...] "told us, Now we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fight, so we must be ready". Barak as early as May had drawn up contingency plans to halt any intifada in its tracks by the extensive use of IDF snipers, a tactic {{that resulted in the}} high number of casualties among Palestinians during the first days of rioting.|$|E
