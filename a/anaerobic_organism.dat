It is a facultative <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> {{that can}} infect humans via the oriental rat flea.

All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E

50|$|An <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> may be {{unicellular}} (e.g. protozoans, bacteria) or multicellular. For practical purposes, {{there are}} three categories of anaerobe: obligate anaerobes, which are harmed {{by the presence of}} oxygen; aerotolerant organisms, which cannot use oxygen for growth but tolerate its presence; and facultative anaerobes, which can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if it is present. Human muscle cells function as facultative anaerobes during vigorous exercise and this creates a build-up of the byproduct lactic acid in the muscles, resulting in the characteristic burning and aching sensations.|$|E

50|$|Amphibacillus xylanus is a gram-positive-spore forming {{bacterium}} with cells 0.3 μm to 0.5 μm {{in diameter}} and 0.9 μm to 1.9 μm in length. A. xylanus is a facultative <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> which can grow in several different environments. Its success in a multitude of environments stems from multiple metabolic pathways, each with high ATP yields. It is flagellated and motile. It grows best at pH 8.0-10.0 but not at pH 7.0. It is catalase and oxidase negative. This helps to explain better the unique method of metabolism on which the organism relies.The cells have meso-diaminopimelic acid. The cellular fatty acids consists of iso-branched and anteiso-branched acids and considerable amounts of straight-chain acids. The DNA base composition of these strains ranged from 36 to 38 G+C % (guanine plus cytosine). This in combination with DNA homology determined that A. xylanus {{was not related to}} strains of representative species of the genera bacillus, clostridium, and sporolactobacillus. Considering these and its unique metabolism along with 5S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) sequencing the bacterium is hard to relate to other bacteria in its taxonomic schemes as so little of its genome matched any other bacterium.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> that are {{involved}} in the process of anaerobic digestion including acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetogens) and methane-forming (methanogens). These organisms feed upon the initial feedstock, which undergoes a number of different processes converting it to intermediate molecules including sugars, hydrogen, and acetic acid, before finally being converted to biogas.Different species of bacteria are able to survive at different temperature ranges. Ones living optimally at temperatures between 35-40 °C are called mesophiles or mesophilic bacteria. Some of the bacteria can survive at the hotter and more hostile conditions of 55-60 °C, these are called thermophile.Methanogens come from the domain of archaea. This family includes species that can grow in the hostile conditions of hydrothermal vents. These species are more resistant to heat and can therefore operate at high temperatures, a property that is unique to thermophile.As with aerobic systems the bacteria in anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive. In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen. Gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks. Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air. The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, then the 'intermediate' end products are primarily alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide with trace levels of hydrogen sulfide.In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. It is therefore common practice to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as [...] "seeding" [...] the digesters, and typically takes place with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry.|$|E

The livelihood of the anaerobic organisms was also tested at the longest possible of preliminary experiment so that the microbial activity in the leachate sample lasts longer. To prepare <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> activated solution (AOAS), a ratio of 1 : 3 : 10 which was: 1 part of molasses/brown sugar; 3 parts of fruit waste; and 10 parts of distilled water were used. The mixture was amalgamated in a Teflon container and mixed thoroughly. The AOAS was fermented for 12  weeks. The survival of the microorganisms was largely dependent by {{the temperature of the}} environment. Therefore, the prepared mixtures were kept under minimum temperature fluctuations without direct sun light exposure. The off-gassing process occurred during the 7  days of fermenting with the released of carbon dioxide (CO 2). The entire process of fermentation was strictly monitored. In addition, the cover of the tank was ensured tightly closed to avoid generation of mold. The pH value was observed at the final duration of fermentation. A pH value in the range of 3 – 4 indicated that the fermentation process has completed. Next, the anaerobic organisms were kept in an airtight container to keep it anaerobic prior to use. Fundamentally, the activated <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> suspension is a mixture of molasses (brown sugar) and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>organism</b> in free chlorinated water or rice rinse water which provides the minerals for the multiplication of the microorganisms (Mohamad Yatim et al. 2009). The activated anaerobic organisms were then fermented in an anaerobic environment for 7 – 10  days of incubation. Prior to the experimental works, each of the containers was rinsed with 10  % (v/v) HCL and then deionised with water to remove background effects of the medium.|$|E
