5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the United States.

Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
