40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Sympatric steelhead <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> {{rainbow trout}} (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{are known to}} exist in many rivers {{throughout}} the Pacific Rim. Whether sympatric steelhead <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> rainbow trout are polymorphisms within a single gene pool or two reproductively isolated populations has significant implications concerning the study and conservation of this polytypic species. I examined population structure and use of spawning and rearing habitats by steelhead <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> rainbow trout in the Deschutes River, Oregon. I used otolith microchemistry to determine the maternal origin (steelhead verses resident) of adult steelhead <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> rainbow trout based on Sr/Ca ratios in primordia and freshwater growth regions of otoliths. Only steelhead of steelhead origin <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> rainbow trout of resident origin were encountered. In the Babine River of British Columbia, however, steelhead of <b>resident</b> origin <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> rainbow trout of steelhead origin were present. Temporal and spatial segregation of spawning habitat served to limit breeding between steelhead <b>and</b> <b>resident</b> rainbow trout in the mainstem Deschutes River. The timing of 50...|$|R
