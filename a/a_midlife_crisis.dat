5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive who has <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis</b> when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film {{is described by}} academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's explorations of romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.|$|E
25|$|Calvin sees Dr. Berger as {{the events}} of the recent past have caused him to begin to doubt many things he once took for granted, leading to <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis.</b> This leads to strain in his {{marriage}} as he finds Beth increasingly cold and distant, while she in turn believes he is overly concerned about Conrad {{to the point of being}} manipulated. Finally the friction becomes enough that Beth decides to leave him at the novel's conclusion. Father and son, however, have closed the gap between them.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{found the}} play revelatory, {{and they went}} {{backstage}} to meet Osborne. Olivier {{was impressed by the}} American's reaction, and asked Osborne for a part in his next play. John Heilpern suggests the great actor's about-face was due to <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis,</b> Olivier seeking a new challenge after decades of success in Shakespeare and other classics, and fearful of losing his pre-eminence to this new kind of theatre. George Devine, artistic director of the Royal Court, sent Olivier the incomplete script of The Entertainer (1957, film version released in 1960) and Olivier initially wanted to play Billy Rice, the lead character's decent elderly father. On seeing the finished script, he changed his mind and took the central role as failing music-hall performer Archie Rice, playing to great acclaim both at the Royal Court and then in the West End.|$|E

All the general needs to say is, ‘I need you to help.’ The hit rate - my success rate - on that model is {{extremely}} high.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In April 2007, Steele {{revealed}} that he began identifying himself as Roman Catholic in recent years, after decades of self-professed atheism. In an interview with Decibel magazine, Steele explained: [...] "There are no atheists in foxholes, they say, and I was a foxhole atheist for a long time. But after going through <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis</b> and having many things change very quickly, it made me realize my mortality. And {{when you start to}} think about death, you start to think about what's after it. And then you start hoping there is a God. For me, it's a frightening thought to go nowhere. I also can't believe that people like Stalin and Hitler are gonna go to the same place as Mother Teresa." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Jeff Stark {{liked the}} comedy and wrote, [...] "Argentinean {{director}} Juan José Campanella's Son of the Bride {{is about a}} lot of things, but at its core it's about <b>a</b> man's <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>A</b> witty script, a fleet camera and a pitch-perfect cast keep the movie from being dragged under by the selfishness of its central character...By the end, this crisply agreeable picture has made several points. One, I suppose, is that there are different levels of reconciliation, in troubled families and beleaguered businesses as well as in nations beset by permanent crisis. A more important one, perhaps, is that there's a difference between dropping out and running away." ...|$|R
50|$|Skeezix {{called his}} adoptive father Uncle Walt. Unlike most comic strip {{children}} (like the Katzenjammer Kids or Little Orphan Annie), {{he did not}} remain a baby or even a little boy for long. He grew up to manhood, the first occasion where real time was shown continually elapsing in a major comic strip over generations. By the time the United States entered World War II, Skeezix was an adult, courting Nina Clock and enlisting {{in the armed forces}} in June 1942. He later married Nina and had children. In the late 1960s, he faced <b>a</b> typical <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis.</b> Walt Wallet himself married Phyllis Blossom and had other children, who grew up and had kids of their own. During the 1970s and 1980s, under Dick Moores authorship, the characters briefly stopped aging. When Jim Scancarelli took over, natural aging was restored.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{after five}} years off the set and 14 years since she starred in a {{prominent}} US theatrical film, Loren starred in Rob Marshall's film version of Nine, based on the Broadway musical that {{tells the story of}} <b>a</b> director whose <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis</b> causes him to struggle to complete his latest film; he is forced to balance the influences of numerous formative women in his life, including his deceased mother. Loren was Marshall's first and only choice for the role. The film also stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Penélope Cruz, Kate Hudson, Marion Cotillard, and Nicole Kidman. As a part of the cast, she received her first nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award.|$|R
2500|$|While {{teaching}} at Yale, Yeston continued {{to attend the}} BMI workshop principally {{to work on his}} project, begun in 1973, to write a musical inspired by Federico Fellini's 1963 film 8½. [...] As a teenager, Yeston had seen the film, about a film director suffering <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> <b>crisis</b> and a creativity drought, and he was intrigued by its themes. [...] "I looked at the screen and said 'That's me.' I still believed in all the dreams and ideals of what it was to be an artist, and here was a movie about... an artist in trouble. [...] It became an obsession," [...] Yeston told The New York Times in 1982. [...] Yeston called the musical Nine (the age of the director in his flashback), explaining that if you add music to 8½, [...] "it's like half a number more." ...|$|E
