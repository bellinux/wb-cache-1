2500|$|In {{a forest}} somewhere outside the city, the protagonist meets {{a woman and}} they have sex. After, he tells her that he has [...] "lost something"—he cannot {{remember}} his name. She leads him to a cave and tells him to enter. Inside, he finds long loops of chain fitted with miniature prisms, mirrors, and lenses. He dons the chain and leaves the cave, {{only to find the}} woman {{in the middle of a}} field, turning into a tree. Panicked, he flees. Many characters in the novel wear the same sort of “optic chain”; all <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> discuss how they came to do so. On a nearby road, a passing truck stops to pick him up. The trucker, hauling artichokes, drops him off at the end of a suspension bridge leading across the river to Bellona.|$|E

60|$|Now, reader, we feel {{bound to}} tell you in {{confidence}} that there are few things more difficult than drawing a story to a close!

60|$|In {{the various}} {{editions of the}} letters of Vespucci, the grossest {{variations}} and inconsistencies in dates will be found, evidently the errors of hasty and careless publishers. Several of these have been corrected by the modern authors who have inserted these letters in their works. [307] The same disregard to exactness which led to these blunders, may have produced the interpolation of this voyage, garbled out of the letters of Vespucci and the accounts of other voyagers. This is merely suggested as a possible mode of accounting for what appears so decidedly to be a fabrication, yet which we <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> attribute to {{a man of the}} good sense, the character, and the reputed merit of Vespucci.|$|E
60|$|Going down to Liddesdale once, I {{drew the}} castle of Hermitage in my fashion, and sketched it so {{accurately}} {{that with a}} few verbal instructions Clerk put it into regular form, Williams[201] (the Grecian) copied over Clerk's, and his drawing was engraved as the frontispiece of {{the first volume of}} the Kelso edition, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.[202] Do you know why you have written all this down, Sir W.? Because it pleases me to record that this thrice-transmitted drawing, though taken originally from a sketch of mine, was extremely like Hermitage, which neither of my colleagues in the task had ever seen? No, that's not the reason.

60|$|These {{dogs are}} the {{scavengers}} of the city. That is their official position, {{and a hard}} one it is. However, it is their protection. But for their usefulness in partially cleansing these terrible streets, {{they would not be}} tolerated long. They eat any thing and every thing that comes in their way, from melon rinds and spoiled grapes up through all the grades and species of dirt and refuse to their own dead friends and relatives--and yet they are always lean, always hungry, always despondent. The people <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> kill them--do not kill them, in fact. The Turks have an innate antipathy to taking the life of any dumb animal, it is said. But they do worse. They hang and kick and stone and scald these wretched creatures to the very verge of death, and then leave them to live and suffer.|$|E
6000|$|Instantly my mind {{grasped the}} reverse {{side of the}} problem. I took {{for the title of}} my story these words: White Eagle, the Red Pioneer, and {{presented}} {{the point of view of}} a nomad who turns his back on the wilderness which he loves, and sets himself the task of leading his band in settlement among the plowmen. In a collection of tales, some of which have not been published even in magazines, I have grouped studies of red individuals with intent to show that a village of Cheyennes has many kinds of people just like any other village. [...] "Hippy, the Dare Devil," [...] "White Weasel, the Dandy," [...] "Rising Wolf, the Ghost Dancer," [...] are some of the titles in this volume. Whether it will get itself printed in my lifetime or not is a problem, for publishers <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> issue a book of short stories, any kind of short stories. [...] "Stories about Indians are no longer in demand," [...] they say. Nevertheless, some day I hope these stories may get into print as a volume complementary to Main Traveled Roads, and They of the High Trails.|$|E

Weeds and the excellencies of most men we may find in the barren wilderness, they grow under every hedge; but thine are garden, and so choice things, and will not thrive without much water, no, without the water of God's river. Dwell, therefore, here; that thy soul may be as a watered garden (Jer 31:12; Isa 12:1-3). And when thou seest how those that <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> die,[19] make provision at Tunbridge, Epsom, the Bath, and other places, and what houses they get {{that they may have}} their dwellings by those waters, then do thou consider of thy spiritual disease, and how nothing can cure thee but this blessed water of life; be also much of desires to have a dwelling-place in Jerusalem, that thou mayest always be nigh to these waters. Be often also in watering thy plants with these waters. I mean the blessed graces of God in thy soul; then shalt thou grow, and retain thy greenness, and prove thyself to be a disciple indeed. And herein is God, and thy Father, glorified, that thou bear much fruit (John 15:8).|$|E

It is pitiful to see men so fond of their moneybags. The numbers of men who can be relied upon to rise are satisfactory, and more even than I had hoped for; for in matters like this a man must proceed cautiously, and only sound those upon whom he feels sure beforehand he can rely. The worst of it is, they are all waiting for each other. One will move if another will move, but none will be first. They will move if I get a victory. But how can I win a victory when I have no army nor money to raise one, and when each city will fight only in its own defence, and will not put a man under arms for the common cause?" ...|$|E
60|$|This was a long, hard afternoon's {{work for}} nothing. However, {{it is my}} idea that {{experience}} is never too dearly bought. I will never do some things again, and the harder these fish are to catch, the more time and effort it takes--the more intelligence and cunning--all the more will I appreciate success if it ever does come. It is in the attainment of difficult tasks that we earn our reward. There are several old bonefish experts here in camp, and they laughed when I related some of our experiences. Bonefishermen <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> tell anything about their methods. This must be a growth of the difficult game. I had an expert bonefisherman tell me {{that when he was}} surprised while fishing on one of the shoals, he always dropped his rod and pretended to be digging for shells. And {{it is a fact that}} the bonefish guides at Metacumbe did not let any one get a line on their methods. They will avoid a bonefishing-ground while others are there, and if they are surprised there ahead of others, they will pull up anchor and go away. May I be preserved from any such personal selfishness and reticence as this! One of these bonefish experts at the camp told me that in all his years of experience he had never gotten a bonefish bite. If you feel a tug, it is when the bonefish is ejecting the hook. Then it is too late. The bonefish noses around the bait and sucks it in without any apparent movement of the line. And that can be detected first by a little sagging of the line or by a little strain upon it. That is the time to strike. He also said that he always broke his soldier crabs on a piece of lead to prevent the jar from frightening the fish.|$|E
6000|$|I {{maintain}} that Boston, as one approaches it and passingly {{takes in the}} line of Bunker Hill Monument, soaring preëminent among the emulous foundry-chimneys of the sister city, is fine enough to need no comparison with other fine sights. Thanks to the mansard curves and dormer-windows of the newer houses, there is a singularly picturesque variety among the roofs that stretch along the bay, and rise one above another on the city's three hills, grouping themselves about the State House, and surmounted by its India-rubber dome. But, after all, does human weakness crave some legendary charm, some grace of uncertain antiquity, in the picturesqueness it sees? I own that the future, to which we are often referred for the [...] "stuff that dreams are made of," [...] is more difficult for the fancy than the past, that the airy amplitude of its possibilities is somewhat chilly, and that we naturally long for the snug quarters of old, made warm by many generations of life. Besides, Europe spoils us ingenuous Americans, and flatters our sentimentality into ruinous extravagances. Looking at her many-storied former times, we forget our own past, neat, compact, and convenient for the poorest memory to dwell in. Yet an American not infected with the discontent of travel could hardly approach this superb city without feeling something of the coveted pleasure in her, without a reverie of her Puritan and Revolutionary times, and the great names and deeds of her heroic annals. I think, however, we were well to be rid of this yearning for a native American antiquity; for in its indulgence one cannot but regard himself and his contemporaries as cumberers of the ground, delaying the consummation of that hoary past which will be so fascinating to a semi-Chinese posterity, and will be, ages hence, the inspiration of Pigeon-English poetry and romance. Let us make much of our two hundred and fifty years, and cherish the present as our golden age. We healthy-minded people in the horse-cars <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> lose a moment of it, and are aggrieved that the draw of the bridge should be up, naturally looking on what is constantly liable to happen as an especial malice of the fates. All the drivers of the vehicles that clog the draw on either side have a like sense of personal injury; and apparently it would go hard with the captain of that leisurely vessel below if he were delivered into our hands. But this impatience and anger are entirely illusive.|$|E

6000|$|The third {{interpolation}} of flattery to Pisistratus in {{the person}} of Nestor is found in VII. 125-160. The Achaean chiefs <b>are</b> <b>loath</b> <b>to</b> accept the challenge of Hector to single combat. Only Menelaus rises and arms himself, moved by the strong sense of honour which distinguishes a warrior notoriously deficient in bodily strength. Agamemnon refuses to let him fight; the other peers make no movement, and Nestor rebukes them. It is entirely in nature that he should fall back on his memory of a similar situation in his youth; when the Arcadian champion, Ereuthalion, challenged any prince of the Pylians, and when [...] "no man plucked up heart" [...] to meet him except Nestor himself. Had there never been any Pisistratus, any poet who created the part of a worthy and wordy veteran must have made Nestor speak just as he does speak. Ereuthalion [...] "was the tallest and strongest of men that I have slain!" [...] and Nestor, being what he is, offers copious and interesting details about the armour of Ereuthalion and about its former owners. The passage is like those in which the Icelandic sagamen dwelt lovingly on the history of a good sword, or the Maoris on the old possessors of an ancient jade patu. An objection is now taken to Nestor's geography: he is said not to know the towns and burns of his own country. He speaks of the swift stream Keladon, the streams of Iardanus, and the walls of Pheia. Pheia [...] "is no doubt the same as Pheai" [...] [Footnote: Monro, Note on Odyssey, XV. 297.] (Odyssey, XV. 297), [...] "but that was a maritime town not near Arkadia. There is nothing known of a Keladon or Iardanus anywhere near it." [...] Now Didymus (Schol. A) [...] "is said to have read [Greek: Phaeraes] for [Greek: Pheias]," [...] following Pherekydes. [Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, vol. i. 308.] M. Victor Bérard, who has made an elaborate study of Elian topography, says that [...] "Pheia is a cape, not a town," [...] and adopts the reading [...] "Phera," [...] the [Greek: Pherae] of the journey of Telemachus, in the Odyssey. He thinks that the [Greek: Pherae] of Nestor is the Aliphera of Polybius, and believes that the topography of Nestor and of the journey of Telemachus is correct. The Keladon is now the river or burn of Saint Isidore; the Iardanus is at the foot of Mount Kaiapha. Keladon has obviously the same sense as the Gaelic Altgarbh, [...] "the rough and brawling stream." [...] Iardanus is also a stream in Crete, and Mr. Leaf thinks it Semitic--"Yarden, from yarad to flow"; but the Semites did not give the Yar to the Yarrow nor to the Australian Yarra Yarra.|$|E
