The Irwin bit may afford greater space for waste removal, greater strength (because the design allows for a center shank of increased size within the flutes, as compared to the Jenning bits), or smaller manufacturing costs. This style of bit was invented in 1884, and the rights sold to Charles Irwin who patented and marketed this pattern the following year.|$|E

5000|$|An {{increment}} borer is a specialized tool used to extract {{a section of}} wood tissue from a living tree with relatively minor injury to the plant itself. [...] The tool consists of a handle, an <b>auger</b> <b>bit</b> and a small, half circular metal tray ( [...] the core extractor) that fits into the auger bit; the last is usually manufactured from carbide steel. It is most often used by foresters, researchers and scientists to determine the age of a tree - the relative science being called dendrochronology - The operation enables the user to count the rings in the core sample, to reveal {{the age of the}} tree being examined and its growth rate. After use the tool breaks down: <b>auger</b> <b>bit</b> and extractor fit within the handle, making it highly compact and easy to carry.|$|E
50|$|Wood augers have a screw to {{pull them}} into the wood, as a gimlet has, and a cutting lip that slices out {{the bottom of the}} hole. The <b>auger</b> <b>bit,</b> meant to be used in a brace, also has cutting spurs to cut a clean circle deeper than where the lips scrape out the wood.|$|E

50|$|A drill {{is a tool}} {{fitted with}} a cutting tool {{attachment}} or driving tool attachment, usually a drill bit or driver bit, used for boring holes in various materials or fastening various materials together. The attachment is gripped by a chuck {{at one end of}} the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or <b>auger</b> <b>bits),</b> grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS masonry drill), countersinking, counterboring, or other operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{twist drill}} bits used in metalworking also {{work well in}} wood, {{but they tend to}} chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in rough holes for carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade <b>bits</b> and self-feeding <b>auger</b> <b>bits.</b> Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits, Forstner bits and hole saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat.|$|R
50|$|The company {{became one}} of the nation's largest {{wholesale}} enterprises with nationally known quality brands, among which Blue Grass was the most readily recognizable. John Primble knives, developed by an employee of the company, became a Belknap brand with its own division, made in Louisville between 1947 and 1985 by the John Primble Belknap Hardware Co. The Crusader manufacturing brand of Belknap included contractors' shovels, hammers, hatchets, axes, drawing knives, carpenters' pincers, planes, screw drivers, hand drills, wrecking bars, <b>bit</b> braces, <b>auger</b> <b>bits,</b> chisels, pliers, wrenches, tin snips, and tin ceilings. Other popular Belknap manufactured products included rifles, guns, padlocks, lawn mowers, and bicycles. Belknap inventory in the vast warehouse spaces grew larger and larger, and the Belknap neon sign could be seen from miles away.|$|R

25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with a hole through the center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as a flywheel, and a length of cord. The weight is attached {{near the bottom of the}} shaft and the hole board is slipped over the top. The cordage is run through a hole near the top of the shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a square hole made to fit certain sized <b>auger</b> <b>bits</b> or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to design and}} fabricate a low cost and longer life span automatic fish feeder. Besides that, another objective of this project is to use the programmable interface controller (PIC) as a controller to control the machine. This automatic fish feeder is designed to dispense food into the aquarium at a particular time each day. The components for the developed machine can be divided into two types which are automation blocks and mechanical parts. Automation blocks components includes a DC motor, limit switch, relays and a PIC controller. The mechanical parts include <b>auger</b> <b>bit</b> and also the mechanical structure of the machine. An automatic device to feed fish at predetermined amounts of food and time. Fish feeder combines mechanical and electrical system to control fish feeding activity. This device consists of pellet tank, distributor and a stand. The dispensed food will be controlled by a motor which situated under the tank. A propeller design that differs by angle of force applied to spread the food, will distribute the pellet onto tank. A control system attached to this device allows the fish to be fed atmpredetermined food amount and time. Timer is used to control the motor which run the <b>auger</b> <b>bit</b> and propeller to increase functional efficiency. In this project, concepts are generated through the research on the existing patents to improve its limitations. A rotational movement of <b>auger</b> <b>bit</b> cause the food container rotates and dispenses the food from a small hole. The fish feeder is successfully fabricated and tested. Feeding can be done at predetermined interval of time and accurate amount of food is obtained. Furthermore the waste of fish food in pond is reduced efficiently. Results show that the machine would be able to feed the fish at a certain time range which is being set by the user using the built-in timer in the PIC controller. Besides that, one of the main future developments is to network the whole system which means by combining a few PICs and controlling them from only one control center. As a conclusion, this project is quite successful because it is able to fulfill all of the objectives stated and also performing up to expectation...|$|E

40|$|This machine cuts coal along a {{longwall}} face extending up to 500 feet by a rotating <b>auger</b> with <b>bits.</b> The machine also transports the coal that is cut acting as screw conveyor. By virtue of an integral shroud comprising {{part of the}} conveyor the machine is also amenable to a separation of the zones where men work from air being contaminated by dust and methane gas by the cutting action. Beginning as single intake air courses, the air separates at the working section where one split provides fresh air to the Occupied Zone (OZ) for human needs and the other split purges and carries away dust and methane from face fragmentation in the Cutting Zone (CZ). The attractiveness of the Variable Wall Mining Machine is that it addresses the limitations of current longwall mining equipment: it can consistently out-produce continuous mining machines and most longwall shearing machines. It also is amenable to configuring an environment, the dual-duct system, where the air for human breathing is separated from dust-laden ventilating air with methane mixtures. The objective of the research was to perform a mathematical and experimental study of the interrelationships {{of the components of}} the system so that a computer model could demonstrate the workings of the system in an animation program. The analysis resulted in the compilation of the parameters for three different configurations of a dual aircourse system of ventilating underground mines. In addressing the goal of an inherently safe mining system the dual-duct adaptation to the Variable Wall Mining Machine appears to offer the path to solution. The respirable dust problem is solvable; the explosive dust problem is nearly solvable; and the explosive methane problem can be greatly reduced. If installed in a highly gassy mine, the dual duct models would also be considerably less costly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. China is {{launching}} the Chang'e project to send automated machine for acquiring the lunar soil {{and returning to}} the earth. Thus, {{we are trying to}} develop a kind of effective mechanism for the exploration mission of lunar soil coring. This paper presents a rotary-percussive coring drill which is a novel scheme for the deep surface soil acquirement. Two degrees of freedom are included in the proposed drill mechanism. Specifically-designed drill unit including <b>auger</b> and drill <b>bit</b> is employed to finish the coring of the simulant of lunar regolith. We have proposed a novel coring concept named soft-bag coring. Since there is no relative motion between the soft-bag and the cut soil core, the soft-bag method may keep the original stratification of lunar soil. A test-bed has been developed to conduct experimental tests under different drilling parameters and circumstances. The related drilling parameters such as rotary speed, penetration ratio, and percussive frequency are adjusted to adapt to different situations in the experiments. The experimental results indicate that the specifically considered drill mechanism with soft-bag inside can get high coring ratio and excellent stratification of the soil...|$|R
25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an <b>auger</b> or screw <b>bit</b> that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|R
