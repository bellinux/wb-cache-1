The result of the qualitative data through think aloud showed that (1) the most dominant LLS employed by students were listening music, utilizing time for practicing and self-evaluating, (2) the most dominant LLS used by high <b>achieving</b> students were utilizing time for practicing, practicing English together and self-evaluating, whereas the most dominant LLS used by low <b>achieving</b> students were listening music, asking friend and selecting topic. The data were collected through documentation used to classify high <b>achieving</b> students and low <b>achieving</b> students based on their grade point average.

40|$|Part 1 : Distributed ProtocolsInternational audienceMany uniform {{total order}} {{broadcast}} protocols {{have been designed}} in the last 30 years. Unfortunately, none of them <b>achieves</b> both optimal throughput and low latency. Indeed, protocols <b>achieving</b> optimal throughput rely on a ring dissemination pattern, which induces high latencies. Protocols <b>achieving</b> low latency rely on IP multicast and fail to <b>achieve</b> good throughput because of message losses. In this paper, we describe FastCast, the first protocol that <b>achieves</b> both optimal throughput and low latency. To <b>achieve</b> low latency, FastCast relies on IP multicast. To <b>achieve</b> optimal throughput, FastCast defines a protocol responsible for dynamically computing the throughput at which processes can send IP multicast messages. Thanks to this dynamic bandwidth allocation protocol, FastCast allows multiple processes to simultaneously send messages, while avoiding message losses. An evaluation of FastCast on a cluster of 8 machines shows that it indeed <b>achieves</b> optimal throughput and a very low latency...|$|R
