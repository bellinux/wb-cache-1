5|$|Black was {{the author}} of the {{landmark}} decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one. Before Gideon, the Court had held that such a requirement <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|In Gideon v. Wainwright, Justice Harlan {{agreed that}} the Constitution {{required}} states to provide attorneys for defendants who could not afford their own counsel. However, he believed that this requirement <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> at trial, and not on appeal; thus, he dissented from Douglas v. California.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v.

But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{was deeply}} {{read in the}} history of {{government}} and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right {{to keep and bear arms}} (although this <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to laws {{enacted by the}} Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.

5|$|The first form of {{sanctions}} {{initiated by the}} US against Yugoslavia took place already from 1990 as the Nickels Amendment, which was sponsored by senators Don Nickles and Bob Dole. The amendment was passed due to concerns about Albanians being arrested in Kosovo. The amendment officially came into legal effect from May 6, 1992; although it <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to $5 million-worth of US foreign aid, it was reported as instrumental in denying SFR Yugoslavia its last application for IMF loans before its breakup and hyperinflation episode.|$|E

5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I {{made the sign of}} the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> as an electroplate.|$|E

5|$|The {{authorities}} {{responded to}} the chaos with emergency legislation; the Ordinance of Labourers was passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making {{it a crime to}} refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were <b>applied</b> <b>only</b> in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
