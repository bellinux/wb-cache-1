40|$|This study {{examined}} the role that employee perceptions of dispositional <b>gratitude,</b> state <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> institutionalized <b>gratitude</b> had upon job satisfaction. Employees (n = 171) completed measures of dispositional, state <b>and</b> institutionalized <b>gratitude</b> together with job satisfaction. Multiple Hierarchical Regression showed that state <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> institutional <b>gratitude</b> uniquely predict job satisfaction. The results have implications for the fields of positive organizational scholarship and positive organizational behavior and suggest that workplaces aiming to increase job satisfaction can do so through organizationally-based <b>gratitude</b> interventions <b>and</b> by institutionalizing <b>gratitude</b> into workplace culture...|$|R
40|$|M. A. Satisfactory psychosocial {{development}} {{during adolescence}} will equip individuals with intrapersonal and interpersonal resources to facilitate adaptive negotiations {{of the complex}} adult world. There has been increasing empirical interest in fostering optimal development in adolescents through enhancing positive attributes and aspects of mental health. Accordingly, researchers have begun investigating the benefits of frequent experiences of <b>gratitude,</b> <b>and</b> have found that gratitude is associated with subjective well-being (SWB) among adolescents. The relationship between <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> SWB may be particularly important for South African youth, whose development occurs {{within the context of}} socio-political difficulties associated with transformation in the post-apartheid era, which could {{have a negative impact on}} their SWB. However, there has been no research undertaken to investigate <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> SWB among South African adolescents. This study investigated the prevalence of <b>gratitude,</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> SWB, among 812 adolescents in Gauteng. Specifically, the prevalence of state <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> trait <b>gratitude</b> were determined, <b>and</b> compared across female and male adolescents, and among participants from different population groups. Further, the relationship between state <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> SWB, <b>and</b> trait <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> SWB, was established and compared across gender and among individuals from various population groups. A quantitative non-experimental design was employed. Data was collected by self-report questionnaires assessing the prevalence of <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> SWB. The data was analysed by examining mean scores, conducting one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), as well as Pearson‟s product moment-correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up ANOVAs...|$|R

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to Palermo in August and in September became the senior {{officer in the}} Mediterranean after Jervis' successor Lord Keith left to chase the French and Spanish fleets into the Atlantic. Nelson {{spent the rest of}} 1799 at the Neapolitan court but put to sea again in February 1800 after Lord Keith's return. On 18 February Généreux, a survivor of the Nile, was sighted and Nelson gave chase, capturing her after a short battle and winning Keith's approval. Nelson had a difficult relationship with his superior officer: he was gaining a reputation for insubordination, having initially refused to send ships when Keith requested them and on occasion returning to Palermo without orders, pleading poor health. Keith's reports, and rumours of Nelson's close relationship with Emma Hamilton, were also circulating in London, and Earl Spencer wrote a pointed letter suggesting that he return home: You {{will be more likely to}} recover your health and strength in England than in any inactive situation at a foreign Court, however pleasing the respect <b>and</b> <b>gratitude</b> shown to you for your services may be.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience to hold together a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where he was, or claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. No one knew where Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least reachable. Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was able to offer Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention <b>and</b> <b>gratitude.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether gratitude {{was correlated}} with distinct coping styles, and whether coping styles mediated the relationship between <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Participants (n = 236) completed measures of coping styles, dispositional <b>gratitude,</b> <b>and</b> measures of well-being. Gratitude correlated positively with seeking both emotional and instrumental social support, positive reinterpretation and growth, active coping, <b>and</b> planning. <b>Gratitude</b> correlated negatively with behavioural disengagement, self-blame, substance use, and denial. Coping styles mediated up to 51 % {{of the relationship between}} <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> stress, but did not substantially mediate the relationship between <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> either happiness, depression, or satisfaction with life. We suggest that different mechanisms relate gratitude to separate aspects of well-being.

40|$|<b>Gratitude</b> <b>and</b> {{appreciation}} {{are currently}} measured using three self-report instruments, the GQ 6 (1 scale), the Appreciation Scale (8 scales), and the GRAT (3 scales). Two studies {{were conducted to}} test how these three instruments are interrelated, whether they exist under the same higher order factor or factors, <b>and</b> whether <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> appreciation is a single or multi-factorial construct. In Study 1 (N = 206) all 12 scales were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis. Both parallel analysis and the minimum average partial method indicated a clear one-factor solution. In Study 2 (N = 389) multigroup confirmatory factor analysis supported the one-factor structure, demonstrated the invariance of this structure across gender, and ruled out the confounding effect of socially desirable responding. We conclude <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> appreciation are a single-factor personality trait.

40|$|ABSTRACT Previous work {{suggests}} {{women might}} possess {{an advantage over}} men in experiencing <b>and</b> benefiting from <b>gratitude.</b> We examined whether women perceive <b>and</b> react to <b>gratitude</b> differently than men. In Study 1, women, compared with men, evaluated gratitude expression to be less complex, uncertain, conflicting, and more interesting and exciting. In Study 2, college students and older adults described and evaluated a recent episode when they received a gift. Women, compared with men, reported less burden and obligation <b>and</b> greater <b>gratitude.</b> Upon gift receipt, older men reported the least positive affect when their benefactors were men. In Studies 2 and 3, women endorsed higher trait gratitude compared with men. In Study 3, over 3 months, women with greater gratitude {{were more likely to}} satisfy needs to belong <b>and</b> feel autonomous; <b>gratitude</b> had the opposite effect in men. The willingness to openly express emotions partially mediated gender differences, and effects could not be attributed to global trait affect. Results demonstrated that men were less likely to feel <b>and</b> express <b>gratitude,</b> made more critical evaluations of <b>gratitude,</b> <b>and</b> derived fewer benefits. Implications for the study and therapeutic enhancementofgratitudearediscussed. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that gratitude is linked to greater psychological and physical well-being (Emmons & McCullough, 2004); helps build lasting, meaningful social relationship...|$|R
