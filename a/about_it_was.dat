5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent supposition in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E

25|$|The seventh cholera {{pandemic}} {{began in}} Indonesia, called El Tor after the strain, and reached East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1963, India in 1964, and the Soviet Union in 1966. From North Africa, it spread into Italy by 1973. In the late 1970s, there were small outbreaks in Japan {{and in the}} South Pacific. There were also many reports of a cholera outbreak near Baku in 1972, but information <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> suppressed in the USSR. In 1970, a cholera outbreak struck Sağmalcılar district of Istanbul, then an impoverished slum, claiming more than 50 lives; eventually the incident led to the renaming of the district as present-day Bayrampaşa by the authorities who were harshly criticized.

25|$|Three men {{managed to}} escape from Nitzanim during the day. They hid until nightfall and then {{infiltrated}} through the Egyptian lines {{until they reached the}} Givati outposts. They were not aware that Nitzanim had surrendered and the only information <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> received from Egyptian broadcasts, so the Givati commander Shimon Avidan found that out only that evening. Despite the fall of Nitzanim, he decided to attack on the night of June 7–8, as planned. One company took Hill 69 and positions to threaten the Egyptian lines at Isdud and prepared to recapture Nitzanim. Meanwhile, another, unsuccessful, attack was carried out against Isdud. Hill 69 was considered tactically important as an obstacle on the road to Isdud in face of the imminent truce.|$|E
25|$|Cabinet Ministers held {{a conference}} at 10 Downing Street on 5pm {{on the day}} of the assassination. They {{suspected}} Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government “should be pressed to deal with the matter”. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried about their personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson’s murder, and perceived British pressure to do something <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.|$|E
