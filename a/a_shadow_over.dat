5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

If his body casts <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> the pitch the shadow must not move until after the batsman has played (or had the opportunity to play) at the ball.|$|E
25|$|Hours {{after the}} {{assassination}} of Bakhtiar, a British hostage was released from Lebanon, presumably held by Hezbollah, but a French hostage was taken. Although many in the Iranian exile community speculated of official French complicity in Bakhtiar's death, the second kidnapping is said to cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> such theories. The French would seem unlikely to support an operation that included the kidnapping of another French hostage in Lebanon, {{but there is no}} apparent connection between the two events.|$|E
25|$|However, due to {{numerous}} {{factors such as}} long term embezzlement and corruption by officials, frequent expeditions to the south, huge palace constructions, many war and rebellion campaigns {{as well as his}} own extravagant lifestyle, all of these cost the treasury a total of 150.2 million silver taels. This, coupled with his senior age and the lack of political reforms, ushered the beginning of the gradual decline and eventual demise of the Qing Empire, casting <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> his glorious and brilliant political life.|$|E

25|$|Ledger died on 22 January 2008 from an {{accidental}} intoxication from prescription drugs. A {{few months before}} his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight {{and in the midst}} of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. His untimely death cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> the subsequent promotion of the $185million Batman production. Ledger received numerous posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he became the first actor to win an award posthumously), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} 1864 cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> Christian IX's rule {{for many years}} and his {{attitude}} to the Danish case—probably without reason—was claimed to be half-hearted. This unpopularity was worsened as he sought unsuccessfully {{to prevent the spread of}} democracy throughout Denmark by supporting the authoritarian and conservative prime minister Estrup, whose rule 1875–94 was by many seen as a semi-dictatorship. However, he signed a treaty in 1874 which allowed Iceland, then a Danish possession, to have its own constitution, albeit one that still had Denmark ruling Iceland. In 1901, he reluctantly asked Johan Henrik Deuntzer to form a government and this resulted in the formation of the Cabinet of Deuntzer. The cabinet consisted of members of the Venstre Reform Party and was the first Danish government not to include the conservative party Højre, even though Højre never had a majority of the seats in the Folketing. This was the beginning of the Danish tradition of parliamentarism and clearly bettered his reputation for his last years.|$|E
500|$|The book follows Henry Perowne, a middle-aged, {{successful}} surgeon. Five chapters chart his day {{and thoughts}} on Saturday the 15 February 2003, {{the day of}} the demonstration against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the largest protest in British history. Perowne's day begins in the early morning, when he sees a burning aeroplane streak across the sky. This casts <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> the rest of his day as reports on the television change and shift: is it an accident, or terrorism? ...|$|E

Professor William Roberts {{was associated with the}} poll, {{and is the author of}} several books on modern Italian history; he commented that: [...] "The show's inflated image of organized crime casts <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> both the state and its Italian American community." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks had {{an unhappy}} {{childhood}} after her alcoholic father abandoned the family; {{her mother was}} emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill. [...] By her own account, her childhood cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> her whole life. She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. Wealth gave her {{the freedom to choose}} her own subjects. [...] She often painted people close to her, such as the Italian writer and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, and her partner of more than 50 years, the writer Natalie Barney.|$|E
500|$|Bole heaped praise on the episode's {{final scene}} in which Janeway [...] "stalks" [...] into the {{corridor}} outside sickbay after performing the procedure which restores Tuvok and Neelix. He extolled, [...] "That last shot I did with Kate , as she's walking into the camera, she told the whole story with her face. [...] She gave a great performance. [...] I only asked for a few things; she brought that look and emotion to work with her." [...] In his book The Meaning of Star Trek, author Thomas Richards also credited Mulgrew in this scene. [...] Richards saw Janeway troubled by her difficult decision between two undesirable options and how [...] "she must live with the choice. [...] death has cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> the ship, {{and for the first}} time in the series the Federation has put to death one of its own." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} of the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter, [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] supplanted [...] "Leather Apron" [...] as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer. The name [...] "Jack" [...] was already used to describe another fabled London attacker: [...] "Spring-heeled Jack", who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came. The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans, the Boston Strangler, and the Beltway Sniper. Examples derived from Jack the Ripper include the French Ripper, the Düsseldorf Ripper, the Camden Ripper, the Blackout Ripper, Jack the Stripper, the Yorkshire Ripper, and the Rostov Ripper. Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> later serial killers.|$|E
500|$|Bernard {{became an}} {{advisor to the}} North {{administration}} on matters concerning the colonies. [...] He generally took a harder line than his predecessor Thomas Pownall, who advocated for colonial interests in Parliament. [...] Proposals he made in 1771 included ideas central to the 1774 Massachusetts Government Act, which severely constrained colonial political power, including a council appointed by the governor rather than one elected by the assembly. [...] Bernard may also {{have played a role}} in the difficulties Benjamin Franklin had in being recognized as a colonial agent; after Franklin's credentials were refused by the colonial secretary, he encountered Bernard in an antechamber. [...] Biographer Colin Nicolson observes that Bernard's presence as an advisor to the ministry [...] "cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>over</b> virtually ever American measure regarding Massachusetts" [...] that the ministry considered, because of Bernard's role in breaking trust between the colonists and the London government and the subsequent radicalization of Massachusetts politics.|$|E
