25|$|Not all {{machines}} are solely used for embroidery; some {{are also used}} for sewing. Some of the more advanced features becoming available include a large color touchscreen, <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> <b>interface,</b> auto threading, built-in design editing software, embroidery adviser software, and design file storage systems. Commercial embroidery machines can be purchased with a set number of needle colors per head(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 15,18 or more colors). Industrial embroidery {{machines are}} available with 1 to 56 heads.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{personal}} computers accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device through a built-in slot or a USB adaptor, SD cards {{cannot be used}} as the primary hard disk through the onboard ATA controller because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling. This use requires a separate SD controller chip or an SD-to-CompactFlash converter. However, on computers that support bootstrapping from <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> <b>interface,</b> an SD card in a USB adaptor can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.|$|E
500|$|Firstly {{conceived}} and still used today for optical storage devices (CD-RW drives, DVD drives, etc.), several manufacturers offer external portable USB hard disk drives, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, {{limited by the}} current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface (in practice about 30MB/s for USB 2.0 and potentially 400MB/s or more for USB 3.0). These external drives typically include a [...] "translating device" [...] that bridges between a drive's interface to <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> <b>interface</b> port. Functionally, the drive appears to the user much like an internal drive. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently Thunderbolt.|$|E

40|$|USB based data {{acquisition}} system has been developed to interface an unmanned weather station to a PC. System consists of a high speed flash microcontroller and <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> <b>interfacing</b> module. Various sensors and equipments of the unmanned weather stations {{are connected to the}} microcontroller. It sends collected data to the computer via the <b>USB</b> <b>interfacing</b> module. The <b>USB</b> <b>interfacing</b> module fulfils all the hardware requirements of the <b>USB</b> <b>interface.</b> The system completes with application software at the computer end which displays, logs and generates reports of collected weather data. The system has been designed as a generic high speed {{data acquisition}} system which can be easily extended or converted to a completely different application by altering only the firmware and software. Throughout the project the best possible data acquisition techniques and programming techniques have been adopted. The result is a {{data acquisition system}} which not only acquires data, but does it in a highly optimized manner...|$|R
