40|$|OBJECTIVE—To compare {{estimates}} of the medical costs of smoking in the United States and to consider their relevance to assessing the costs of smoking in developing countries and the net economic burden of smoking.  DATA SOURCES—A Medline search through early 1999  using keywords "smoking" and "cost", with review of article reference lists.  STUDY SELECTION—Peer-reviewed papers examining medical costs in a single year, covering the non-institutionalised American population.  DATA EXTRACTION—Methods underlying study estimates were identified, described, and compared with <b>attributable</b> <b>expenditure</b> methodology in the literature dealing with costs of illness. Differences in methods were associated with implied differences in findings.  DATA SYNTHESIS—With one exception, the studies find the annual medical costs of smoking to constitute approximately 6 - 8 % of American personal health expenditures. The exception, a recent study, found much larger attributable expenditures. The lower estimates may reflect the limitation of analysis to {{costs associated with the}} principal smoking-related diseases. The higher estimate derives from analysis of smoking-attributable differences in all medical costs. However, the finding from the most recent study, also considering all medical costs, fell in the 6 - 8 % range.  CONCLUSIONS—The medical costs of smoking in the United States equal, and may well exceed, the commonly referenced figure of 6 - 8 %. This literature has direct methodological relevance to developing countries interested in assessing the magnitude of their current cost-of-smoking burden and their future burdens, with differences in tobacco use histories and the availability of chronic disease treatment affecting country-specific estimates. The debate over the use of gross or net medical cost estimates is likely to intensify with the proliferation of lawsuits against the tobacco industry to recover expenditures on tobacco-produced disease.    Keywords: medical costs; smoking; United State...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} state-by-state totals {{of medical}} <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to cigarette smoking for calendar year 1993. METHODS: The smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) of total state medical expenditures, {{by type of}} expenditure, were estimated using a national model that describes the relationship between smoking and medical expenditures, controlling {{for a variety of}} sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral factors. Employing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the authors used the national model to estimate SAFs for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, then applied these SAFs to published state medical expenditures, by type of expenditures, to estimate total 1993 state medical <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to smoking. National estimates are the sums of state estimates. RESULTS: In 1993, the estimated proportion of total medical <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to smoking for the U. S. as a whole was 11. 8 %, with a range across states from 6. 6 % to 14. 1 %. By type of expenditure, SAFs ranged from a low of 8. 0 % for home health expenditures to a high of 15. 9 % for nursing home expenditures for the nation as a whole. Total U. S. medical <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to smoking amounted to an estimated $ 72. 7 billion in 1993 (95 % interval estimate $ 48. 0 -$ 97. 4 billion). Estimates of total smoking-attributable state medical expenditures (SAEs) ranged from $ 79. 6 million to $ 8. 72 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking accounted for a substantial portion of state and national medical expenditures in 1993, with considerable variation among states. The range across states was due to differences in smoking prevalence, health status, other socioeconomic variables used in the model, and the magnitude and patterns of state medical expenditures...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of death from cancer among women in Germany. Despite its {{clinical}} and economic relevance, no attributable costs for breast cancer have been reported for Germany so far. The objective of this study is to estimate age-specific breast cancer <b>attributable</b> health <b>expenditures</b> for Germany. METHODS: Sickness fund data from 1999 representing about 26 million insured (i. e. 32 % of the total German population) have been analysed using generalized additive models and the error propagation law. Costs have been inflated to 2010. RESULTS: Breast cancer attributable costs decreased with age. Among breast cancer patients aged 30 - 45 years, about 90 % of all health expenditures were due to breast cancer, whereas in breast cancer patients aged 80 - 90 years, about 50 % were due to breast cancer. Breast cancer attributable costs amounted to about € 9, 000 annually for patients below 55 years of age and declined to about € 3, 000 in 90 -year-old breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides estimates of attributable breast cancer costs in Germany. Compared with the international literature, the estimates were plausible but had a tendency to underestimate breast cancer attributable costs...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} procedural {{gender equity}} by assessing predisposing, enabling and need predictors {{of gender differences}} in annual medical expenditures and utilization among hypertensive individuals in the U. S. Also, to estimate and compare lifetime medical expenditures among hypertensive {{men and women in}} the U. S. ^ Data source. 2001 - 2004 the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS); 1986 - 2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality in the National Death Index through 2002 (2002 NHIS-NDI). ^ Study design. We estimated total medical expenditure using four equations regression model, specific medical expenditures using two equations regression model and utilization using negative binomial regression model. Procedural equity was assessed by applying the Aday et al. theoretical framework. Expenditures were estimated in 2004 dollars. We estimated hypertension-attributable medical expenditure and utilization among men and women. ^ To estimate lifetime expenditures from ages 20 to 85 +, we estimated medical expenditures with cross-sectional data and survival with prospective data. The four equations regression model were used to estimate average annual medical expenditures defined as sum of inpatient stay, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, office based visits, and prescription drugs expenditures. Life tables were used to estimate the distribution of life time medical expenditures for hypertensive men and women at different age and factors such as disease incidence, medical technology and health care cost were assumed to be fixed. Both total and hypertension <b>attributable</b> <b>expenditures</b> among men and women were estimated. ^ Data collection. We used the 2001 - 2004 MEPS household component and medical condition files; the NHIS person and condition files from 1986 - 1996 and 1997 - 2000 sample adult files were used; and the 1986 - 2000 NHIS that were linked to mortality in the 2002 NHIS-NDI. ^ Principal findings. Hypertensive men had significantly less utilization for most measures after controlling predisposing, enabling and need factors than hypertensive women. Similarly, hypertensive men had less prescription drug (- 9. 3 %), office based (- 7. 2 %) and total medical (- 4. 5 %) expenditures than hypertensive women. However, men had more hypertension-attributable medical expenditures and utilization than women. ^ Expected total lifetime expenditure for average life table individuals at age 20, was $ 188, 300 for hypertensive men and $ 254, 910 for hypertensive women. But the lifetime expenditure that could be attributed to hypertension was $ 88, 033 for men and $ 40, 960 for women. ^ Conclusion. Hypertensive women had more utilization and expenditure for most measures than hypertensive men, possibly indicating procedural inequity. However, relatively higher hypertension-attributable health care of men shows more utilization of resources to treat hypertension related diseases among men than women. Similar results were reported in lifetime analyses. ^ Key words: gender, medical expenditures, utilization, hypertension-attributable, lifetime expenditure...|$|R

This study aimed to develop the estimates of the direct costs of medicine for smoking in Iran during 2014. Methods: A prevalence-based approach was used to estimate the annual costs of smoking. Then, an econometric model was applied to estimate the Smoking-Attributable Fraction (SAF) for direct costs (prescription medicine) of smoking-attributable diseases. A variety of sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral factors were controlled by the model. Results: In 2014, the estimated proportions of medicine <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to smoking in Tehran (capital of Iran) were totally 8 % for chemotherapy and 1 % for other medical treatments.

Osteoporosis is defined as a systemic skeletal disease, characterised by low bone mass and microarchitectural detoriation of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE: Advanced {{dementia}} {{is characterized}} by severe cognitive impairment and complete functional dependence. Patients 2 ̆ 7 goals of care should guide the prescribing of medication during such terminal illness. Medications that do not promote {{the primary goal of}} care should be minimized. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of medications with questionable benefit used by nursing home residents with advanced dementia, identify resident- and facility-level characteristics associated with such use, and estimate associated medication expenditures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of medication use by nursing home residents with advanced dementia using a nationwide long-term care pharmacy database linked to the Minimum Data Set (460 facilities) between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use of medication deemed of questionable benefit in advanced dementia based on previously published criteria and mean 90 -day <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to these medications per resident. Generalized estimating equations using the logit link function were used to identify resident- and facility-related factors independently associated with the likelihood of receiving medications of questionable benefit after accounting for clustering within nursing homes. RESULTS: Of 5406 nursing home residents with advanced dementia, 2911 (53. 9...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} various orthopedic conditions and overweight/obesity at the Department of Orthopedics, Malmö University Hospital Sweden. Obesity is associated with numerous major medical conditions. Although the relationship between gonarthrosis and osteoarthritis and body mass index (BMI) is well recognized, other orthopedic conditions have been less well studied. METHODS: We compared the BMI of 2 orthopedic outpatient cohorts of a local community-based urban reference population. Study 1 identified the medical records of 79 consecutive emergency room patients (45 women; age 27 - 49 years) with the diagnosis of ankle fracture, for whom we calculated the BMI from the self-reported height and weight. Study 2 prospectively weighed and measured 647 consecutive patients (316 women, age 20 - 80 years) attending our orthopedic specialty clinic for various recent and chronic conditions during a 3 -week period. RESULTS: The mean BMI was 1. 9 units greater in the patients with ankle fractures than in the age- and gender-matched controls (P 30 kg/m(2) was 3. 46. The orthopedic clinic patients had a mean BMI 1. 4 units greater than the reference population (P 30 kg/m(2) (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: The results of these pilot studies have demonstrated significant relationships between obesity and common orthopedic conditions {{that contribute to the}} global excess medical <b>expenditures</b> <b>attributable</b> to obesity...|$|R
40|$|Executive summaryThe {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} chronic diseases {{is one of}} the major causes of rising health expenditure, as stated by the WHO. Not only chronic diseases are very costly, but they are by far the leading cause of mortality in the world, representing 60 % of all deaths. Diabetes in particular is becoming a major burden of disease. In Switzerland around 5 % of the population suffer of type 2 diabetes and 5 to 10 % of the annual health care budget is attributable to diabetes. If the predictions of WHO do realise, the prevalence of diabetes will double until 2030 and so is expected the <b>attributable</b> health <b>expenditure.</b> The objective of this thesis is to provide policy recommendations as to slow down the disease progression and its costly complication. We study the factors that influence diabetes dynamics and the interventions that improve health outcomes while decreasing costs according to different time horizon and use systems thinking and system dynamic. Our results show that managing diabetes requires using integrated care interventions that are effective on three fronts: (1) delaying the onset of complications, (2) slowing down the disease progression and (3) accelerating the time to diagnosis of diabetes and its complications. We recommend firstly the implementation of those interventions targeted at changing patients' behaviour which are also less expensive, but require a change in the delivery of care and medical practices. Then policies targeted at an earlier diagnosis of diabetes, its prevention and the diagnosis of complications are to be considered. This sequence of interventions allows saving money, as total costs decrease, even including the costs of interventions and result in longer life expectancy of diabetics in the long term. In diabetes management there is therefore a trade-off between medical costs and patients' benefits on the one hand and between the objectives of obtaining results in the short or long term on the other hand. Decision makers need to deliver acceptable outcomes in the short term. Considering this criterion, the preferred policy may be to focus only on diagnosed diabetics, thus attempting to slow down the progression of their disease, compared to an integrated care approach addressing all the aspects of the disease. Such a policy also yields desirable results in terms of costs and patients' benefits...|$|R
