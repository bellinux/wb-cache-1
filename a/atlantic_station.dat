Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the Atlantic coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines. It served as part of the British forces on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Bridgewater {{remained}} on the China Station until 1935, when she joined the Africa Station (later known as the South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Station).</b> The ship returned to Devonport Dockyard on 1 September 1936 for a month's refit {{and then returned to}} Simonstown. Bridgewater had her second high-angle four-inch gun installed during a refit there. It was interrupted by the Munich Crisis of September 1938 when she was ordered to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The ship later resumed her refit and remained in South Africa until she returned to Devonport for another refit on 13 April 1939. It was completed on 17 May when Bridgewater began a leisurely cruise back to South Africa and arrived there in August.|$|E

She departed Malta on 8 January 1940, bound for Freetown where she joined the 20th Destroyer Division for escort duties. In April the ship returned to the Mediterranean where Diamond was assigned to the newly formed 10th Destroyer Flotilla after a short refit at Malta.|$|E

25|$|Misoa {{left the}} Clyde in early August 1941 with large {{squadron}} of landing and troop ships, escorted by eight destroyers, {{and headed for}} Scapa Flow, where four more destroyers joined the convoy, which was intended to seize the Azores.

25|$|Unlike the North <b>Atlantic</b> <b>station,</b> the Mediterranean was a vital British {{operational}} command operating from Malta and Gibraltar. The important shipping route between India and Britain {{passed through the}} Suez Canal, and was considered threatened by France. France was concerned with the route north-south to its colonies in Northern Africa. Fisher retained his flagship from the North American Squadron, , rather than choosing a more powerful but slower traditional battleship, despite criticism from other officers.|$|E

Chicago sailed from New York on 25 November for an extended cruise, as flagship of the South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Station</b> until early July 1901, then as flagship of the European Station. With the squadron, she cruised in northern European, Mediterranean, and Caribbean waters until 1 August 1903, when she proceeded to Oyster Bay, New York, and the Presidential Review.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of World War I experience, SL convoys were one of four trade convoy routes {{organized}} {{at the beginning of}} the Battle of the Atlantic. The other routes were HX convoys from North America, HG convoys from the Mediterranean, and a short-lived series of HN convoys from Norway. Eight ships sailed as convoy SL 1 sailed on 14 September 1939 and three faster ships sailed six days later as a faster section -- sometimes designated SL(F) 1 or SL 1(F). The slower convoy was sometimes similarly suffixed with an (S). Early convoys were usually accompanied by an armed merchant cruiser or one of the South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Station</b> cruisers based at Freetown; but no anti-submarine screen was provided until the slower and faster sections rendezvoused with a single Escort Group in the Southwest Approaches.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{designed}} to carry streetcars, the tunnel ran from Maverick Square in East Boston to downtown Boston's Court Street station, with an intermediate stop at Devonshire (now State). Court Street had pedestrian access to Scollay Square station (now Government Center) but transfers to the East Boston Tunnel required an additional fare of 1 cent. In 1906, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Station</b> (now Aquarium) was opened, with {{a connection to}} the Atlantic Avenue Elevated. Court Street proved to be a problematic terminus as its single-track design limited frequent service. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) began an extension towards Beacon Hill in 1912. The downtown extension was opened to Bowdoin, with an intermediate stop at Scollay Under (now Government Center), on March 18, 1916. Immediately west of the new Bowdoin station platforms, a tight turnaround loop track underground allowed trains to quickly reverse direction for the return trip. An incline leading to a new portal at Joy Street was also installed at this time. The total cost of this extension was $2.3 million.|$|E
