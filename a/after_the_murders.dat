5|$|The {{financial}} {{ties and}} inheritance issues within {{the immediate and}} extended family added a layer of complexity to the case. Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> that Bamber intended to sell them. It {{was one of those}} cousins who found the silencer in the gun cupboard <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation {{about making the}} gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists {{in order to give}} them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> were carried out.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 March 1997, Sylvia Sheils and Mary Callinan were found dead in No.1 Orchard View, Grangegorman, Dublin 7. They were found by Ann Mernagh, another {{resident}} of the house, who raised the alarm at No.5 Orchard View. The house was a two story end of terrace house owned by the Eastern Health Board, and was used to provide sheltered accommodation for outpatients of St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital. The entire Orchard View area was completely demolished 15 years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> and is now an empty plot surrounded by a wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by {{at least one of the}} victims and was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, five days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had {{gone by the time}} the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> {{but were not}} visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
