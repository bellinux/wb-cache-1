5|$|The Nixons {{moved to}} a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, {{and the house was}} smaller and {{contained}} an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> front of a police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge {{him out of the}} way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Nightclubbing {{claimed the}} number 1 slot on NMEs Album of the Year list. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 40 on {{its list of}} Best Albums of the 1980s. Nightclubbing is now widely {{considered}} Jones' best studio album. The album's cover art is a painting of Jones by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones {{is presented as a}} man wearing an Armani suit jacket, with <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> her mouth and a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.|$|E
25|$|Brynner began smoking heavily at age 12, and {{although}} his promotional photos often showed him with <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> hand, he quit the habit in 1971. In September 1983, {{he found a}} lump on his vocal cords. In Los Angeles, only hours before his 4,000th performance in The King and I, he received the test results indicating that while his throat was fine, he had inoperable lung cancer. He and the national tour of the musical were forced {{to take a few}} months off while he underwent radiation therapy, which hurt his throat and made it impossible for him to sing or speak easily. The tour then resumed.|$|E

25|$|Following preparatory school Ross boarded at Haileybury where, {{being both}} small {{for his age}} and a latecomer to his year, he {{initially}} suffered greatly from bullying — to his intense relief the bully {{was killed in a}} vacation cycling accident — but his stock quickly rose when he revealed a talent which matched his passion for cricket. With a hint of the debonair style that was to characterise his life, he avoided participation in the OTC and all study of mathematics and science, instead enjoying art, French poetry and racquet sports. As a senior boy he was caned for making an unlicensed visit to Wimbledon; it was his misfortune that he figured, smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>in</b> a photograph of spectators carried in his headmaster's newspaper the following morning.|$|E
25|$|That night Walt goes to {{the gang}} members' house, where they draw their weapons on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the {{attention}} of the neighbors. Putting <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his hand in his jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E

Upon being scouted out {{of college}} by Canucks personnel, his style of play was {{compared}} to offensive defenceman Christian Ehrhoff. Not aggressive, Tanev relies primarily on his positioning to check players.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{ends with a}} shot of Madonna {{watching}} herself recording the song. In this last scene she {{is dressed in a}} long black coat and holds <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> her hand. Scholars noted that this last shot clearly illustrates the gender paradox of Madonna, because as she watches her female form singing the song, she herself is dressed in an androgynous way, holding a cigarette, which is associated as one of the symbolic forms of male supremacy. Feminist writer Martha Leslie Allen lauded the video, as well as Madonna, [...] "for breaking free of the conventional portrayal of women yet again, and displaying their duality." ...|$|E

500|$|Reubens had {{not always}} thought of his {{character}} as one for children, but sometime during the mid-1980s, he started forming Pee-wee into the best role model he possibly could, making of his show a morally positive show that cared about issues like racial diversity. Reubens was also careful on what should be associated to Pee-wee. Being a heavy smoker, he {{went to great lengths}} never to be photographed with <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> his mouth, even refusing to endorse candy bars and other kinds of junk food, all the while trying to release his own sugar-free cereal [...] "Ralston Purina Pee-wee Chow cereal", a project that died after a blind test.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} album's release the cover {{became part of}} the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] rumour that was {{spreading}} across college campuses in the United States. According to followers of the rumour, the cover depicted the Beatles walking out of a cemetery in a funeral procession. The procession was led by Lennon, dressed in white, as a religious figure, Starr, dressed in black, as the undertaker, McCartney, {{out of step with the}} others, as a barefoot corpse and Harrison, dressed in denim, as the gravedigger. The left-handed McCartney is holding <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> his right hand, said to indicate an imposter and the license plate on the Volkswagon parked on the street is 28IF, meaning McCartney would have been 28 if he had lived.|$|E
500|$|When first {{cast for}} the role, portraying actor William B. Davis thought {{a show about}} the paranormal would not last for long.

For the first two episodes he {{appeared}} in, he smoked [...] "real" [...] cigarettes, but later changed to herbal cigarettes, giving the reason that it was dangerous for his health. In at least one early script draft from the [...] "Pilot", a Special Agent named Lake Drazen is present at the meeting near {{the start of the}} episode, having chosen Scully for an assignment to evaluate the validity of Mulder's work on the X-Files.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E
