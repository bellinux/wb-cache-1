5|$|She and Leopold {{married in}} a {{religious}} ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income – all of which turned her into <b>a</b> <b>multimillionaire.</b> For years the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.|$|E

25|$|Harrison's {{publicity}} stunt backfired. The deal with Brown became the effective end of Confidential and Whisper, as the magazines {{were no longer}} able to publish their usual scandalous stories. The magazines' one and only trial cost Harrison over $500,000—in addition to legal fees of $500,000 and a $5,000 fine for each magazine, Maureen O'Hara settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum on July 1, 1958; Errol Flynn settled on July 8, 1958 for $15,000; and on July 16, 1958, Liberace settled for $40,000, an amount that the pianist might typically exceed with one or two performances. In addition the legal fees and settlements, Harrison gave the Meades $150,000 as a gift. Harrison was still <b>a</b> <b>multimillionaire.</b>|$|E

500|$|After a {{short time}} he {{switched}} careers and became a clerk on a steamboat, frequently working alongside Charles T. Hinde, who later married his sister.

500|$|An {{extremely}} rich widow (Leopold's gifts {{left her}} <b>a</b> <b>multimillionaire),</b> Caroline continued {{to appear in}} newspapers long after Leopold's death. She married Antoine Durrieux, her former love and longtime friend, in 1910, seven months after the king's death. He was formerly a non-commissioned officer in the French army, and served as her chief agent {{at the time of}} Leopold's death, helping her collect the necessary papers to secure her inherited fortune. Because of Durrieux's earlier role in prostituting Caroline off for money, Adam Hochschild speculates that if she had shared some of her riches with him, their arrangement was [...] "surely {{one of the most successful}} feats of pimpery of all time". Though Durrieux recognized her two sons as his own offspring, giving them his surname, he disliked how Caroline insisted he acknowledge their noble ranks when in their presence.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, the Reids {{sold the}} Herald Tribune to John Hay Whitney, <b>a</b> <b>multimillionaire</b> Wall Street {{investor}} who was serving as {{ambassador to the}} United Kingdom at the time. Under his leadership, the Tribune experimented with new layouts and new approaches to reporting the news, and made important contributions {{to the body of}} New Journalism that developed in the 1960s. The paper steadily revived under Whitney, but a 114-day newspaper strike stopped the Herald Tribunes gains and ushered in four years of strife with labor unions, particularly the local chapter of the International Typographical Union. Faced with mounting losses, Whitney attempted to merge the Herald Tribune with the New York World-Telegram and the New York Journal-American in the spring of 1966; the proposed merger led to another lengthy strike, and on August 15, 1966, Whitney announced the closure of the Herald Tribune. Combined with investments in the World Journal Tribune, Whitney spent $39.5 million (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) in his attempts to keep the newspaper alive.|$|E

500|$|Krusty is <b>a</b> <b>multimillionaire</b> who amassed {{his fortune}} mostly by {{licensing}} {{his name and}} image {{to a variety of}} substandard products and services, from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty's brand of cereal, Krusty-O's, which in one episode boasted a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products was launched by Bart, who ate a jagged metal Krusty-O and had to have his appendix removed. The [...] "Krusty Korporation", the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfired when the Soviet Union boycotted the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million. In the TV series and comic books Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger. He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with Mad Cow Disease to save money. Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

He felt as he had felt in the old days when people sneaked up on him in Wall Street and tried to loosen his grip on a railroad or a pet stock.

Mrs. Cheyne lay still and moaned, or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would listen. Hope she had none, and who could offer it? All she needed was assurance that drowning did not hurt; and her husband watched to guard lest she should make the experiment.
