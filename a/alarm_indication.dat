5000|$|Blue alarm, {{also known}} as <b>alarm</b> <b>indication</b> signal (AIS) {{indicates}} a disruption in the communication path between the terminal equipment and line repeaters or DCS.

5000|$|<b>Alarm</b> <b>indication</b> signal (AIS) (also called “all ones” {{because of}} the data and framing pattern) is a signal {{transmitted}} by an intermediate element of a multi-node transport circuit {{that is part of}} a concatenated telecommunications system to alert the receiving end of the circuit that a segment of the end-to-end link has failed at a logical or physical level, even if the system it is directly connected to is still working.

Yet, cassava consumption and production in Central Africa, the region where cassava is the most important staple food, is strongly declining and not substituted by any other important food crop. This <b>alarming</b> <b>indication</b> of hunger and malnutrition in this region and its dependence on cassava is rarely covered in the mass media. The Cassava Biotechnology Network (CBN) is counteracting this trend by bundling the scarce resources and uniting the important stakeholders involved in cassava breeding, production, marketing and consumption in and outside Africa with the aim to overcome the basic constraints of cassava as a food and a cash crop.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to recommend the most effective gear condition indicators for fleet use based on both a theoretical foundation and field data. Gear diagnostics with better performance will be recommended based on both a theoretical foundation and results of in-fleet use. In order to evaluate the gear condition indicator performance on rotorcraft fleets, results of more than five years of health monitoring for gear faults in the entire HUMS equipped Army helicopter fleet will be presented. More than ten examples of gear faults indicated by the gear CI have been compiled and each reviewed for accuracy. False <b>alarms</b> <b>indications</b> will also be discussed.

The performance of gear algorithms used in the commercial units and the effectiveness of the gear CI as a fault identifier will be assessed using the criteria outlined in the standards in ADS- 79 A-HDBK, an Army handbook that outlines the conversion from Reliability Centered Maintenance to the On-Condition status of Condition Based Maintenance...|$|R
