5|$|The {{question}} in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards {{is an example of}} delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

25|$|He {{then set}} before them the {{advantage}} which the moment presented {{for an attack}} upon Fort Caroline, with its defenses weakened {{by the absence of}} Ribault who might have taken the best part of its garrison with him, and Ribault's inability to return against the contrary wind, which in his judgment would continue for some days. His plan was to reach the fort through the forest and to attack it. If his approach was discovered, he proposed, on reaching the margin of the woods which surrounded the open meadow where it stood, to display the banners {{in such a way as}} to lead the French to believe that his force was two thousand strong. A trumpeter should then be sent to summon them to surrender, in which case the garrison should be sent back to France, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not, put to the knife. In the event of failure the Spaniards would have become acquainted with the way, and could await at St. Augustine the arrival of reinforcements in March. Although his plan failed to meet with general approval at first, it was finally agreed upon, and so it came about that Menéndez was able to write to the King in his letter of October 15 that his captains had approved his plan.|$|E

500|$|The {{efficiency}} of the railways improved over time, and by the 1980s it had many performance indicators superior {{to that of the}} United States. [...] By the 1980s Soviet railways had become the most intensively used in the world. Most Soviet citizens did not own private transport, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> it was difficult to drive long distances due to the poor conditions of many roads. Another explanation has to do with Soviet policy, the first being the autarkic model created by Joseph Stalin's regime. Stalin's regime had little interest in rail transport, or any other form for transport, and instead focused most of the country's investments in rapid industrialisation. Stalin's regime was not interested in establishing new railway lines, but decided to conserve, and later expand, much of the existing railways left behind by the Tsars. However, as Lev Voronin, a First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union, noted {{in a speech to the}} Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1989; the railway sector was the [...] "main negative sector of the economy in 1989". As industrial output declined in the late-1980s so did the demand for transportation, which led to a decline in freight transport in return.|$|E
