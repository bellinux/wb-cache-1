The minimality {{of the resulting}} covers is {{shown to be a}} basic property of the criterion used for separation, namely the ratio between left- and right-hand sides of the extended cover inequality looked for. Computational results obtained on a set of randomly generated (MKP) instances together with instances from the OR-library with up to 180 variables and 60 constraints show significant reduction in overall computing times as compared with the standard version of Cplex 6. 5 in MIP mode using <b>automatic</b> <b>cover</b> inequality generation...|$|E
40|$|While most {{schemes for}} <b>automatic</b> <b>cover</b> song {{identification}} {{have focused on}} note-based features such as HPCP and chord profiles, a few recent papers surprisingly showed that local self-similarities of MFCC-based features also have classification power for this task. Since MFCC and HPCP capture complementary information, we design an unsupervised algorithm that combines normalized, beat-synchronous blocks of these features using cross-similarity fusion before attempting to locally align a pair of songs. As an added bonus, our scheme naturally incorporates structural information in each song to fill in alignment gaps where both feature sets fail. We show a striking jump in performance over MFCC and HPCP alone, achieving {{a state of the}} art mean reciprocal rank of 0. 87 on the Covers 80 dataset. We also introduce a new medium-sized hand designed benchmark dataset called "Covers 1000," which consists of 395 cliques of cover songs for a total of 1000 songs, and we show that our algorithm achieves an MRR of 0. 9 on this dataset for the first correctly identified song in a clique. We provide the precomputed HPCP and MFCC features, as well as beat intervals, for all songs in the Covers 1000 dataset for use in further research.

40|$|We {{introduce}} herein {{the concept}} of the ill-configured object (ICO). An ICO is a geometrical object having a stable (unique) name but varying configurations (shape, size, components, and component layout). In addition, we introduce {{the concept of}} the neighbour set representation (NSR) of an object, and show that the NSR is well-fitted to the ICO. Moreover, we show that any object, either non-ICO or ICO, can be characterized as a solution of a set theoretic equation defined on its NSR. An algorithm is thus designed to detect ICOs in images. Two applications of the proposed theory are then presented. The first is ICO recognition in aerial images, and the second is automatic matching of highly deviated landmark-less images. The latter provides a foundation for <b>automatic</b> land <b>cover</b> change analysis using satellite/aerial images obtained under different conditions (time, height, and direction). * Corresponding author. 1...|$|R

In addition, the use of remotely sensed imagery in Europe has been extended towards determination of the areas potentially eligible for the farmer subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), through interactive or <b>automatic</b> land <b>cover</b> identification. For accurate quantification and fast identification of agricultural land cover areas from the imagery, a hybrid method, which combines automated clustering of self-organizing maps with object based image analysis, and called SOM+OBIA, is proposed. Performance analysis on three test zones (using multi-temporal Rapideye imagery) indicates that for the basic land cover categories (forest, water, vegetated areas, bare areas and sealed surfaces), unsupervised classification with the proposed SOM+OBIA method achieves an identification accuracy comparable {{to the accuracy of}} the traditional interactive object oriented analysis, with considerably less user interaction.

In initial planning, a Maginot ouvrage with several combat blocks, interconnected and served by underground galleries, barracks and magazines, was planned for Oberroedern. The plan was reduced to two separate casemates, Oberroedern Nord and Sud. The casemate is arranged on two levels, with living facilities and utilities on the lower level and combat stations on the upper level. The casemate fired to the north and south along the casemate line, and an 37mm anti-tank gun/JM machine gun combination firing to the south and an AC37/JM firing to the north, with a JM machine gun firing to the west..
