5|$|The Mk.8 APC (Armor-Piercing, Capped) shell weighed 2,700lb (1225kg) and was {{designed}} to penetrate the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships. At 20,000yards (18km) the Mk.8 could penetrate 20inches (500mm) of steel <b>armor</b> <b>plate.</b> At the same range, the Mk.8 could penetrate 21feet (6.4m) of reinforced concrete.|$|E
5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way {{with the use of}} steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. Redoutable nonetheless had wrought iron <b>armor</b> <b>plate,</b> and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of high-explosive shells made {{the use of}} iron <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> on warships necessary. In 1859 France launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had {{the profile of a}} ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, Gloire was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. Gloire prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.|$|E
5|$|Three Taliban {{fighters were}} in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed the wounds of the two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/5 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 38 whose mount was wider, and lighter, {{than that of}} the Flak 30, and the {{platform}} was enlarged to accommodate it from 1942. Vehicle width increased to , but the height returned to that of the normal vehicle. Initially, vehicles modified with the wider platform for the Flak 38 did not have a special designation, but they were given one sometime in 1943. The earliest known use is 1 September 1943, but the older name lingered until 1 December 1944. The Luftwaffe ordered 293 sets of <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> (Behelfspanzerung) for its vehicles in 1943. These plates covered the radiator, windshield and both sides of the driver's compartment and were fitted to both versions.|$|E

5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of <b>armor</b> <b>plate.</b> At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the range was 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum range was 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E
5|$|Loke had her keel {{laid down}} in March 1867 and was {{launched}} on 4 September 1869. She was commissioned on 22 October 1871 {{at the cost of}} 1,200,428 Swedish krona. The delay in construction may have been due to manufacturing difficulties by the British supplier of her <b>armor</b> <b>plate.</b> Generally the monitors were kept in reserve for most of the year; only being commissioned for two to four months during the summer and fall. Loke made only seven cruises, the last in late 1880, and was not commissioned afterwards. Funds were requested to rebuild her in 1903 and 1908, but they were refused. She was decommissioned on 21 August 1908 and advertised for sale. The details of her fate are unknown, but presumably she was sold and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Navarin, {{named after}} the Battle of Navarino, was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco-Russian Works and {{construction}} began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891. She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out, but did not enter service until June 1896 {{at a cost of}} over nine million rubles. Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of armor plates, the gun mountings, and other components, compounded by inefficiencies in building. One example of such was that the Russian <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness, but the builder somehow lost track of this fact and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Lemnos {{was placed}} in {{inactive}} reserve; sections of her <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> was removed to build fortifications {{on the island of}} Aegina. She was disarmed in 1937 and thereafter used as a barracks ship. On 28 October 1940, Italy invaded Greece, initiating the Greco-Italian War as part of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's expansionist ambitions. The Greek army quickly defeated the Italians and pushed them back to Albania. Less than two weeks later, the Italian fleet was badly damaged in the British Raid on Taranto, which significantly reduced the threat the Italian Regia Marina posed to the Greek fleet. Lemnos remained out of service, but spare guns from she and Kilkis were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece. On 6 April 1941, the German Wehrmacht invaded Greece to support its Italian ally in the stalemated conflict. The hulk of Lemnos was bombed in Salamis Naval Base by Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers on 23 April. The ship was beached to prevent her from sinking; her wreck was broken up {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, König {{suffered}} significant damage. A heavy shell {{penetrated the}} main armored deck toward the bow. Another shell hit the armored bulkhead {{at the corner}} and shoved it back five feet, breaking off a large piece from the <b>armor</b> <b>plate</b> in the process. Shell splinters from another hit penetrated several of the casemates that held the 15cm secondary guns, two of which were disabled. The ammunition stores for these two guns were set on fire and the magazines had to be flooded to prevent an explosion. The ship nevertheless remained combat effective, as her primary battery remained in operation, as did most of her secondary guns; König could also steam at close to her maximum speed. Other areas of the ship had to be counter-flooded to maintain stability; 1,600tons of water entered the ship, either {{as a result of}} battle damage or counter-flooding efforts. The flooding rendered the battleship sufficiently low in the water to prevent the ship from being able to cross the Amrum Bank until 09:30 on 1 June. König was taken to Kiel for initial repairs, as that was the only location that had a floating dry dock large enough to fit the ship. Repairs were conducted there from 4 to 18 June, at which point the ship was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard. König was again ready to join the fleet by 21 July. In the course of the battle, she suffered 45 men killed and 27 wounded, the highest tally for any surviving battleship in the German fleet.|$|E
