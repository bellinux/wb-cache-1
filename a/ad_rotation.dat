Adding bottom topography under the dense source greatly reduces the amount of entrainment which the descending plume undergoes.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports 3 D {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} compressible, thermal convection {{in a small}} rectilinear domain placed tangentially on a rotating sphere at latitude 45. The spatiotemporal evolution of convection is studied in an initially non-homogeneous toroidal magnetic eld located at the interface of a 2 -layer unstable/stable polytropic stratication. The eects from {{a variation of the}} rotation rate and magnetic eld strength are explored. In weak eld convection the solutions bear close resemblance to the eld-free situation with the magnetic eld treated as a passive ingredient. In this case a signicant amount of magnetic energy is transported downwards into the stable layer by penetrative motions where the eld is concentrated in small-scale tube-like features. In the case of a dominating magnetic eld, the overall structure of convection changes dramatically towards a two-dimensional, more laminar flow with convective motions occurring in columnar cells aligned with the mean magnetic eld. The latter quickly becomes flat in the convection zone due to magnetic buoyancy eects. Magnetic quenching of the flow heavily influences the mixing properties of convection, thereby, reducing the fluxes of kinetic energy and enthalpy and suppressing the downward transport of magnetic energy. <b>Adding</b> <b>rotation</b> in strong eld convection generates streaming motions parallel to the mean eld. These motions contain a large fraction of the total kinetic energy. The horizontally-averaged (mean) flows, on the other hand, are less energetic.

40|$|Nanophotonics {{deals with}} how {{electromagnetic}} fields can be confined and squeezed to orders of dimensions below the light wavelength. Plasmonics, {{one of the}} fields of nanophotonics, study collective free electron oscillations driven by light in metallic nanostructures and interfaces. The greater part of plasmonics applications utilizes the plasmons light localization property and the resulting enhanced photon density of states. Plasmonic effects {{can also be used}} to harvest and modify photon angular momentum. In this thesis, plasmonics is used in two different ways: 1) to induce rotation in optically trapped gold nanoparticles, and 2) to create chiroptically active metasurfaces. 	 Optical tweezers was pioneered in the early 1970 s by the work of A. Ashkin. As its name suggests, optical tweezers allow for precise control of the position and movement of small objects with light. This can be used for manipulation of fragile samples, such as living cells, and nanoparticles with nanometer-level precision, as well as for sensing of forces in the piconewton range. <b>Adding</b> <b>rotation</b> frequency control to the set of features applicable to a trapped particle could expand the utility of optical tweezers to nanoscale viscosity probing, mixing in micro- and nanofluidics, and microtooling of soft matter. In this thesis, gold nanoparticles, trapped by a 2 D optical trapping setup against an interface, were set in rotation using a circularly polarized laser beam. The absorbed and scattered photons possess an intrinsic spin angular momentum that generate an optical torque, which is balanced by a drag force from the surrounding water. The power dependence of the rotation frequencies could be well fitted by classic electromagnetism and hydrodynamic theories. Additionally, the light induced heating of the nanoparticles at higher laser powers was shown to strongly influence the friction of the enclosing liquid. New measurements on nanorods rotating against a water-oil interface showed increased rotation frequencies, possibly due to a particle orientation change. Rotating nanoparticles could offer a new route to probe interfaces as well as being nanoscale sources of emulsion. 	 In order to manipulate photon angular momentum, nanoparticle metasurfaces were fabricated with a focus on breaking their overall geometrical symmetry. The main technique used was hole-mask colloidal lithography, which is low cost, high speed, and offers large area coverage. Based on this method, and thanks to metallic angular and rotating evaporation techniques, diverse nanostructure patterns with increased feature control were developed. Starting from a simple geometrical principle, chirality, two types of metasurfaces were investigated. Both showed pronounced optical activity, that is, different optical response to illumination with right- or left-handed circularly polarized light. In the case of tetramers built from particles with different height, forming a staircase, an intrinsic chiral response was induced through strong near-field coupling and phase retardation effects. In the case of anisotropic particle layers, an evanescent illumination configuration resulted in extrinsic chirality, which allowed for a contrast of around 90 % in reflection between right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. This effect arises from the illumination geometry, the polarization-dependent excitation efficiency of the nanoparticles with respect to their orientation, and the density of dipoles on the surface. The observed phenomena might be utilized in, for example, polarization manipulation and enantiomer sensing. 	 Taken together, the results presented in this thesis offer some new insights into the fascinating interaction between circularly polarized light and plasmonics nanoparticles. The results may also provide as well a platform for further development of complex nanostructures for basic studies and diverse plasmonic applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate visuospatial functioning in cortical and subcortical dementia syndromes. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a cortical dementia syndrome characterized by prominent neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and association cortices of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, although degeneration of subcortical structures has also been documented. Huntington's disease (HD) is primarily a subcortical dementia syndrome characterized by degeneration of the basal ganglia; however, cortical atrophy of frontal cortex may occur in later stages of the disease. AD and HD may present distinct patterns of visuospatial deficits due to the disparate neuropathological processes underlying these two forms of dementia. Differences between these two groups have been reported in spatial location, mental rotation, visual attention, and construction. However, visual organization and recognition abilities have not been systematically investigated. The Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVOT) is a sensitive measure of perceptual organization and recognition, yet it may also have important verbal naming, construction, and mental rotation components that contribute to performance. To investigate the aforementioned issues, 20 AD patients, 20 HD patients, 21 elderly normal controls demographically matched to AD patients, and 20 young normal controls matched to HD patients were assessed with neuropsychological tests designed to measure perceptual organization (including the HVOT), confrontation naming, construction, and mental rotation. The purpose of the {{present study was}} twofold. One, this study compared the visuospatial abilities of patients with AD, a cortical dementia syndrome, and patients with HD, a subcortical dementia syndrome. Two, this study investigated psychometric properties of the HVOT by examining the influence of confrontation naming, mental rotation, and constructional ability on HVOT performance. Results revealed that AD and HD patterns of performance did not differ on visuospatial tasks including measures of perceptual organization, construction, and mental <b>rotation.</b> <b>AD</b> patient performance on the HVOT was strongly associated with confrontation naming and construction ability, whereas HD performance on the HVOT was highly correlated with construction ability. Mental rotation ability was not associated with patient performance on the HVOT. Results of the qualitative scoring of errors on the HVOT revealed that AD and HD patients did not differ significantly in type of errors made; however, there was a trend for AD patients to make more language-based errors and a trend for HD patients to make more perseverative and perceptually based errors. Both AD and HD patients made more of each type of qualitative error relative to their control groups, although not all differences were statistically significant. Overall, the results of this study support the notion that visuospatial deficits are present in both cortical and subcortical dementia syndromes. However, qualitative differences in visuospatial function were discovered. Disparate patterns of performance between AD and HD suggest that fronto-striatal dysfunction may contribute to the greater deficits exhibited by HD patients on visuospatial measures. Furthermore, the results of this study provide evidence that performance on the HVOT involves cognitive capacities above and beyond perceptual organization and recognition. As indicated by Paolo et al. (1996) and Ricker and Axelrod (1995), the HVOT may be a sensitive measure of perceptual organization. However, based on the results of the current study, caution is suggested in interpreting impaired HVOT performance as an indication of visual perception deficits due to the potential contribution of cognitive capacities including naming and construction. Lastly, the present data emphasize the importance of assessing distinct underlying qualitative features that may give rise to comparable quantitative patterns of performance in order to differentiate patient groups such as those with cortical and subcortical dementia syndromes...|$|R
