5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher {{in comparison to}} the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> in the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content.|$|E

5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were <b>also</b> <b>tested.</b> The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E

5|$|After further investigation, it was {{revealed}} on 22 October 2003 that Chambers had {{tested positive for the}} banned steroid THG. Analysis of his backup sample <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> positive and the outcome was confirmed on 7 November 2003, making Chambers the first person to test positive for the new drug. Chambers was suspended the same day with an independent UK Athletics tribunal pending. The disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2004 resulted in a two-year ban from athletics, backdated to begin on 7 November 2003. He was also banned for life from the Olympics and stripped of the medals he had won since mid-2002, after admitting that he had taken THG from that date. Chambers' 2002 relay gold medal performance was erased, costing teammates Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Christian Malcolm their medals in the process. Chambers was also ordered by the IAAF to pay back his earnings from the period of his athletics career that was affected by his drug abuse.|$|E

5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E
5|$|Furious was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades (windbreaks) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Canadian horse and the Newfoundland pony {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. The Canadian horse showed high haplotype diversity, sharing haplotypes with all Canadian populations, as well as draft breeds, Nordic pony breeds and British mountain and moorland pony breeds <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> in the study. The Canadian horse had been shown to be related to draft horse breeds, including the Percheron, Belgian and Clydesdale, in previous microsatellite loci studies. This relationship was supported by findings in the 2012 study. The high levels of diversity in the Canadian horse supported the conclusions of a 1998 study, which determined that the small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation. The 1998 paper also stated that the Canadian horse did not show inbreeding any more significant than other, more popular, breeds.|$|E

5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy.

The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by {{his defeat}} to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became {{a series of}} {{experiments}} which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics {{to a point where}} the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi <b>also</b> <b>tested</b> his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.|$|E
