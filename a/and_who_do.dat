40|$|Background: Numerous {{individual}} characteristics {{have been found}} to be associated with rates of ob-taining flu shots. This study creates a predictive model that assesses the relative impact of each of these factors on increasing rates of flu shots in a population. Methods: The Medicare beneficiary survey from 1998 and 1999 was used. Sixteen factors present in 1998 were compared between subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots. Significant factors were then used in a logistic regression to predict the probability of receiving a flu shot in 1998 and 1999. Results: Seven demographic and 7 health status measures were significantly different between sub-jects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots in 1998. Logistic regression showed that twelve of these variables were associated with a subject receiving a flu shot in 1998 and explained 11. 4 % of the vari-ability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. For the following year, 1999, 7 measures were significantly associated with receiving a flu shot and explained 64 % of the variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. One variable, if the subject had received a flu shot in 1998, was highly predic-tive of a subject receiving a flu shot in 1999, explaining 63 % of the observed variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot in 1999...|$|R

25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} guided focused ultrasound, is a non-invasive intervention (requiring no incision) {{that uses}} high intensity focused ultrasound waves to destroy tissue {{in combination with}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which guides and monitors the treatment. During the procedure, delivery of focused ultrasound energy is guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging. Patients who have symptomatic fibroids, who desire a non-invasive treatment option <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have contraindications for MRI are candidates for MRgFUS. About 60% of patients qualify. It is an outpatient procedure and takes one to three hours {{depending on the size}} of the fibroids. It is safe and about 75% effective. Symptomatic improvement is sustained for two plus years. Need for additional treatment varies from 16-20% and is largely dependent on the amount of fibroid that can be safely ablated; the higher the ablated volume, the lower the re-treatment rate. There are currently no randomized trial between MRgFUS and UAE. A multi-center trial is underway to investigate the efficacy of MRgFUS vs. UAE.|$|E
