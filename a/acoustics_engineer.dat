[...] By 1962 the authorities, after prolonged experiment, had become convinced that no improvement in the hall's reverberation could be achieved by any further treatment of its surfaces. Longer reverberation would require modification to the main structure, reducing the seating capacity and the provision of a new ceiling. This was considered too costly, particularly as any hypothetical gain in ‘warmth’ or ‘resonance’ might well be by the sacrifice of other positive qualities for which the Hall was generally esteemed, for example, its clarity, its comparative uniformity of acoustic response and its freedom from echo.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>engineers</b> usually {{possess a}} bachelor's degree or higher {{qualification}} in acoustics, physics or another engineering discipline.

In other industries, <b>acoustic</b> <b>engineers</b> might: design automobile sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design {{loudspeakers and microphones}} for mobile phones. Acousticians are also involved in researching and understanding sound scientifically. Some positions, such as faculty require a Doctor of Philosophy.|$|R

I am convinced {{that in order for}} anyone to be an <b>acoustics</b> <b>engineer</b> in a musical environment, he has to be a musician. You have to understand the sort of environment that musicians require in a studio, control room or concert hall. Most of us have come across situations in theatres or halls where the orchestra can either hear everybody or each musician is straining to hear his neighbor just to stay in tune. It is the same situation with console manufacturers - the best builders are also users because they know what is required out in the real world." ...|$|E

Mosques are among important infrastructure require good acoustic quality especially during Friday prayer where ‘khutbah’ is performed.

It is essential that architects should consider the acoustical properties of any enclosed room early in the design process.
