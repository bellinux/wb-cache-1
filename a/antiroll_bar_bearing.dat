40|$|A novel kinetic dynamic {{suspension}} (KDS) {{system is}} presented for the cooperative {{control of the}} roll and warp motion modes of off-road vehicles. The proposed KDS system consists of two hydraulic cylinders acting on the <b>antiroll</b> <b>bars.</b> Hence, the <b>antiroll</b> <b>bars</b> are not completely replaced by the hydraulic system, but both systems are installed. In this paper, the vibration analysis in terms of natural frequencies of different motion modes in frequency domain for an off-road vehicle equipped with different configurable suspension systems is studied by using the modal analysis method. The dynamic responses of the vehicle with different configurable suspension systems are investigated under different road excitations and maneuvers. The results of the modal and dynamic analysis prove that the KDS system can reduce the roll and articulation motions of the off-road vehicle without adding extra bounce stiffness and deteriorating the ride comfort. Furthermore, the roll stiffness is increased and the warp stiffness is decreased by the KDS system, which could significantly enhance handing performance and off-road capability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{a comparison}} of performance for an active <b>antiroll</b> <b>bar</b> (ARB) system using two types of control strategy. First of all, the LQG control strategy is investigated and then a novel LQG CNF fusion control method is developed to improve the performances on vehicle ride and handling for an active <b>antiroll</b> <b>bar</b> system. However, the ARB system has to balance the trade-off between ride and handling performance, where the CNF consists of a linear feedback law and a nonlinear feedback law. Typically, the linear feedback is designed to yield a quick response at the initial stage, while the nonlinear feedback law is used to smooth out overshoots in the system output when it approaches the target reference. The half car model is combined with a linear single track model with roll dynamics which are used for the analysis and simulation of ride and handling. The performances of the control strategies are compared and the simulation results show the LQG CNF fusion improves the performances in vehicle ride and handling...|$|R
50|$|Roll {{center height}} {{is a product}} of {{suspension}} instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting <b>antiroll</b> <b>bars</b> rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.|$|R
40|$|Active and {{semi-active}} suspension {{systems are}} widely diffused into the automotive industry. Most {{of the proposed}} devices try to achieve a better compromise between handling and comfort requirements by replacing traditional springs, shock absorbers and <b>antiroll</b> <b>bars</b> with active or semi-active actuators allowing to change suspension stiffness and damping according to a suitable control strategy. An alternative way for controlling passenger car suspensions is proposed in this paper. Traditional passive springs and dampers are maintained, while the geometry of the suspension and thus its kinematics is actively varied. By changing the suspension geometry, spring and damper rates are in fact varied, this modifying the vertical load on the tire and/or the vehicle height from the ground. Among the advantages concerned with this device, the most significant ones are that <b>antiroll</b> <b>bars</b> can be avoided (thus increasing the vehicle interior spaciousness), vehicle aerodynamics can be improved by regulating the vehicle height and vertical loads distribution can be modified during turns. The layout of a double wishbone suspension has thus been adapted and optimized in order to host an active hydraulic actuator connecting the coil spring to the rocker. Then a control strategy has been designed aimed at improving the vehicle handling performances during turns negotiation. The effectiveness of the proposed active suspension system has been assessed by means of numerical simulation carried out with a Multy-Body (MB) vehicle model...|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} design brief the GAZ-24 was to be retired by 1978, and though by that time work on a successor (the GAZ-3102) was underway, {{it was clear that}} the car would have to soldier on the conveyor for a foreseeable future. In 1977, following a 1976 report by NAMI on the Volga's major shortcomings (problematic steering prime among them), GAZ refused to update the GAZ-24's front suspension, instead making only cosmetic changes. (The front suspension would be unchanged until 2003, when the kingpins were changed to sealed ball joints, while the rear got an <b>antiroll</b> <b>bar.)</b> Visually, these Volgas can be identified by front and rear bumper overriders, front fog lights and rear reflectors integrated into a single block. Inside the car gained retractable seat belts, a new dashboard where all exposed metal elements were covered by plastic. In this final shape the car was produced until 1986, the estate until 1987. Including the GAZ-24-10, almost one and a half million such Volgas were produced.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} step in automotive development to evaluate the steering and handling characteristics of a vehicle is through physical subjective assessments and testing. This allows for {{a thorough understanding of}} how the vehicle behaves when driving and how it will be experienced by the customer. However, as physical subjective assessments and testing require real vehicles to be driven on a real track, it is rather inefficient time-wise, costly, and sensitive regarding repetitiveness and to surrounding conditions, compared with using digital development tools. Due to these drawbacks, the general trend in the automotive industry is to move an increasing amount of the development of vehicle steering and handling dynamics from using physical tools and methods to digital ditto. This does however require that the digital tools used provide reliable and trustworthy results, a validation of which is the main purpose of the thesis project presented in this report. The focus here is to validate the partly digital development tool that is the Moving Base Driving Simulator existing at Volvo Cars. This is performed by generating virtual vehicle models of a physical vehicle through measurements in a kinematics and compliance rig. The measurements are performed with three different <b>antiroll</b> <b>bar</b> configurations, thus generating three different vehicle models. The vehicle models are validated by simulating them driving certain manoeuvres, and driving the same manoeuvres in the physical environment in the same vehicle specimen as is used throughout the whole project. After tuning and validation, the virtual vehicle models are used as input to the Moving Base Driving Simulator. Performing a physical subjective assessment in the same vehicle as was measured in the kinematics and compliance rig, and another subjective assessment in the Moving Base Driving Simulator with the same layout, allows for a validation of the simulator by comparing the results. The project is thus covering all major steps included in vehicle dynamics development including kinematics and compliance measurements, generation, analysis and simulations of virtual vehicle models, physical objective measurements, and finally subjective assessments in a physical vehicle and in a driving simulator. The outcome of all stages are presented in this report and shows for example that 94 % of the assessed handling characteristics and 78 % of the steering characteristics change in the same direction in the physical and virtual subjective assessments when changing the <b>antiroll</b> <b>bar</b> configuration of the vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} way of the matching between suspension parameters and vehicle performance is that we assess the matching of suspension design parameters through the driver's subjective experience, this will lead that the vehicle development cycle is long and high cost, meanwhile the matching during the parameters of suspension is blindness. With the development of computer technology, combining the modern design theory and virtual prototyping technology, based on multi-body system dynamics method, the virtual prototyping model of mini passenger car was built. By using understeering degree, roll rate and total RMS acceleration values as evaluation indexes, the orthogonal experiment was designed and the range analysis was carried out, {{and the effects of}} the suspension structure parameters on handling stability and riding such as suspension rate of front suspension and rear suspension, torsion stiffness of <b>antiroll</b> <b>bar,</b> damping ratio of front suspension and rear suspension and so on were studied. Then the remarkable factors are found, the final results supply guidance and support for the optimization of the suspension parameters.
