He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E

25|$|A nonprofessional {{performer}} named Richard Lacovara doubled for Basehart in long {{shots on}} the ledge, {{which had been}} enlarged to minimize risk of falling. Lacovara was protected by a canvas life belt hidden under his costume, connected to a lifeline, Even with the double, Basehart still had to endure over 300 hours of standing on the ledge with little movement during the 50 days of shooting in New York, {{even though he had}} a sprained ankle <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> were ravaged by poison oak contracted on the grounds of his Coldwater Canyon home.|$|E
25|$|Dick-a-Dick was {{renowned for}} his skill in {{traditional}} weapons {{including the use}} of a waddy and shield. His star act was to challenge men to hit him with cricket ball thrown from 15 paces. Even when four balls were thrown at the same time, he was apparently only ever hit once, but claimed he was not ready at the time. He also always won the backwards sprint. He protected his body and head with the shield <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> with the waddy and would slowly move towards the men and suddenly yell, frightening everyone. A replica of Dick-a-Dick's club is held at the Lord's Cricket Ground museum.|$|E
25|$|Surratt and {{the others}} stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath clapped his hands. Four {{soldiers}} of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight {{at the end of}} the rope, swinging back and forth. Surratt's death appeared to be the easiest. Atzerodt's stomach heaved once <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> quivered; then, he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.|$|E

500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm {{going to make sure that}} every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E
500|$|On 12 September, it was {{announced}} that the skeleton discovered during the search might be that of Richard III. Several reasons were given: the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; and there was severe scoliosis of the spine, possibly making one shoulder higher than the other (to what extent depended on the severity of the condition). Additionally, there was an object that appeared to be an arrowhead embedded in the spine; and there were [...] injuries to the skull. These included a relatively shallow orifice, which is most likely to have been caused by a rondel dagger, and a scooping depression to the skull, inflicted by a bladed weapon, most probably a sword. Additionally, the bottom of the skull presented a gaping hole, where a halberd had cut away and entered it. Forensic pathologist, Dr Stuart Hamilton stated that this injury would have left the King's brain visible, and most certainly would have been the cause of death. Dr Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, concurred and described the latter as [...] "a mortal battlefield wound {{in the back of the}} skull". The base of the skull also presented another fatal wound in which a bladed weapon had been thrust into it, leaving behind a jagged hole. Closer examination of the interior of the skull revealed a mark opposite this wound, showing that the blade penetrated to a depth of [...] In total, the skeleton presented 10 wounds: 4 minor injuries on the top of the skull, 1 dagger blow on the cheekbone, 1 cut on the lower jaw, 2 fatal injuries on the base of the skull, 1 cut on a rib bone, and 1 final wound on the King's pelvis, most probably inflicted after death. It is generally accepted that postmortem, Richard's naked body was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and buttocks over the other. This presented a very opportunistic target for onlookers, and the angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of them stabbed Richard's right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back all the way to the front of the pelvic bone and was most probably an act of humiliation. It is also possible that Richard suffered other injuries which left no trace on the skeleton.|$|E

An inquest found that he had died of cardiac failure after being struck several heavy blows on the chest, and had also been beaten with a stick on the back.

2500|$|Rowan was {{planning}} to study {{for a career in}} hotel management, but he had always been interested in sumo from watching television broadcasts. A family friend introduced him to Azumazeki Oyakata, the former Takamiyama, who also originally hailed from Hawaii. Azumazeki overcame his initial concerns that Rowan might be too tall <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> too long for sumo and agreed to let him join his Azumazeki stable, founded in 1986. Rowan flew to Japan in early 1988. Adopting the shikona of Akebono, meaning [...] "new dawn" [...] in Japanese, he made his professional debut in March 1988. This entry cohort {{was one of the most}} successful ever, producing two other yokozuna, Takanohana and Wakanohana (sons of the popular champion from the 1970s, Takanohana Kenshi), as well as a great ōzeki, Kaiō.|$|E
2500|$|Ze'era's {{arrival in}} the Land of Israel and his first {{experiences}} there have been recorded in various anecdotes. He was small of stature and of dark complexion, for which reason Assi called him [...] "Black Pot" [...] (Ab. Zarah 16b), according to an expression current in Babylonia (comp. Meg. 14b; Pes. 88a; Ber. 50a); this name possibly also contained an allusion to his sputtering manner of speech. Perhaps with reference to a malformation of his legs, he was called [...] "the little one with burned legs," [...] or [...] "the dark, burned one with the stubby legs" [...] (comp. Bacher, Ag. Pal. Amor. iii. 7, note 2). But a different explanation of this is given in Bava Metsia 85a, where {{it is said that}} he fasted in order to merit protection from the fires of Gehenna and that he then tested himself every thirty days by sitting in the fire without coming to harm, until one day the sages distracted him (cast an eye upon him) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> were burned. Thus, these nicknames throw light upon Ze'era's ascetic piety (B. M. 85a).|$|E

2500|$|Friday the 13th was Nelson's {{first feature}} film, {{and when he}} went in for his first {{audition}} {{the only thing he}} was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, [...] "It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it." [...] Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the [...] "practical joker victim" [...] of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter's Halloween, or Bob Clark's Black Christmas before that. He served {{as a model for the}} slasher films that would follow Friday the 13th.|$|E
