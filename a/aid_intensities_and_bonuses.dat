40|$|Is {{there an}} effect of aid on {{democracy}} conditional on instability from trade ? This paper reinvestigate the debated effect of aid on democracy with a new specification. We take advantage of previous empirical findings explaining the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of external shocks, and argue {{that in the long}} term, aggregate aid flows can potentially dampen the effects of terms-of-trade instability on the quality of democracy. An empirical investigation with data from 70 developing countries (28 of them african countries) over the period 1980 - 2003 (pooled in two twelve-years periods) provides supportive results. Moreover, the data suggest that terms-of-trade instability affects democracy through income instability. These results are robust to alternative specifications and to the use of different measures of <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> democracy. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the emerging literature and debates on aid, {{within the context}} of expected increases in aid flows to the continent. The trends in ODA flows indicate a reversal in aid flows to the continent since 2000, with subsequent increases in <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> dependence. Although the more recent literature on aid is doubtful if aid only spurs growth in a in a good policy environment, the aid-institutional debate indicates a clear aid-institutional paradox, especially relating to the macroeconomic effects, the fiscal response, the absorptive capacity and the good governance aid debates. The literature further indicates that aid could serve as a barrier to vulnerable societies. From the donors' perspective, it is evident that quantity of aid does not imply quality and that the ultimate responsibility lies with recipient governments to ensure more efficient absorption of aid.

50|$|Furthermore, {{the effect}} of <b>Aid</b> on {{conflict}} <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015) showed that Aid from the US {{seems to have been}} diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014) have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen. These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014) have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{corporate}} governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, <b>and</b> executive <b>bonus</b> pay in Japanese firms. Using {{a sample of the}} largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay relationship. Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability...|$|R
