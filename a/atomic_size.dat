5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small <b>atomic</b> <b>size,</b> and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E

We demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} produce a wide-range of experimentally observed binary phase diagrams (with no intermetallic phases) by reference to the <b>atomic</b> <b>sizes</b> and cohesive energies of the two elemental materials. In some cases, it is useful to employ a single adjustable parameter to adjust the phase diagram (we provided a good choice for this free parameter). Next, we perform a systematic investigation of the effect of relative <b>atomic</b> <b>sizes</b> and cohesive energies of the elements on the binary phase diagrams. We then show that this approach leads to good agreement with several experimental binary phase diagrams. The main benefit of this approach is not the accurately reproduction of experimental phase diagrams, but rather to provide a method by which material properties can be continuously changed in simulations studies. This is one of the keys to the use of atomistic simulations to understand mechanisms and properties in a manner not available to experiment...|$|R

2500|$|The diminished {{metallic}} {{nature of}} the post-transition metals is largely attributable {{to the increase in}} nuclear charge going across the periodic table, from left to right. [...] The increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by an increasing number of electrons but as these are spatially distributed each extra electron does not fully screen each successive increase in nuclear charge, and the latter therefore dominates. With some irregularities, atomic radii contract, ionisation energies increase, fewer electrons become available for metallic bonding, and [...] "ions [...] smaller and more polarizing and more prone to covalency." [...] This phenomenon is more evident in period 4–6 post-transition metals, due to inefficient screening of their nuclear charges by their d10 and (in the case of the period 6 metals) f14 electron configurations; the screening power of electrons decreases in the sequence s > p > d > f. The reductions in <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> due to the interjection of the d- and f-blocks are referred to as, respectively, the 'scandide' or 'd-block contraction', and the 'lanthanide contraction'.
