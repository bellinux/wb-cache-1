5|$|Initially, the Whig {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta {{and its role}} in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian William Stubbs's Constitutional History of England, published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view. Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.|$|E

5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> forward in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning {{the safety of the}} system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now gave him <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> {{up in his}} career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E

50|$|Shaun Micallef's World Around Him was an Australian sketch comedy {{television}} special. Its {{title is}} {{a parody of}} the Australian documentary series The World Around Us. Airing on the Seven Network in 1996, the special provided <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>stepping</b> stone for comedian Shaun Micallef.

5|$|On September30, 1935, the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) {{completed}} Hoover Dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. Behind the dam rose Lake Mead, {{the largest}} artificial {{lake in the}} U.S., capable of holding {{more than two years}} of the Colorado's flow. The construction of Hoover was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as the Boulder Canyon Project. Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Gielgud staged perhaps {{his most famous}} Shakespeare production, a Romeo and Juliet in which he co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier. Gielgud had spotted Olivier's potential and gave him <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. As at Oxford, Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running at the New Theatre for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, comparing it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry.

5|$|At Fort Belvedere, on 10 December, Edward {{signed his}} written abdication notices, {{witnessed}} by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, {{it was given}} effect by Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Under changes introduced in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster, a single Crown for the entire empire {{had been replaced by}} multiple crowns, one for each Dominion, worn by a single monarch in an organisation then known as the British Commonwealth. Though the British government, hoping for expediency and to avoid embarrassment, wished the Dominions to accept the actions of the home government, the Dominions held that Edward's abdication required the consent of each Commonwealth state. This was duly given; by the Parliament of Australia, which was at the time in session, and by the governments of the other Dominions, whose parliaments were in recess. The government of the Irish Free State, taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> towards its eventual transition to a republic, passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 December to remove references to the Crown. The King's abdication was recognised a day later in the External Relations Act of the Irish Free State and legislation eventually passed in South Africa declared that the abdication took effect there on 10 December. As Edward VIII had not been crowned, his planned coronation date became that of George VI instead.|$|E

So I ended up somewhere with “coat to wear” and “dancing bear”. There I was, and I just sort of followed it on. And then I was never the same. And I never wrote particularly conventional songs after that." ...|$|R
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>step</b> in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E

25|$|Economically, {{this era}} is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>stepping</b> stone for Hong Kong. It {{is considered the}} first turning point for Hong Kong's economy. The per capita GDP was still relatively low in 1960. It was approximately the same as Peru, South Africa and Greece in the same decade. By comparison, Argentina had two times and Venezuela had three times the GDP of Hong Kong. The living standard was rising steadily, but low wages continued. The number of registered factories increased from 3,000 in 1950s to 10,000 in 1960s. Registered foreign companies increased from 300 to 500. There were demands for labour in every sector of the economy.|$|R

40|$|Hollow core Photonic Bandgap fibres (HC-PBGFs) are {{the subject}} of {{substantial}} interest due to their intrinsically low nonlinearity and latency, which represent a substantial advantage over conventional, solid fibres. In this paper, we review recent progress at the ORC towards achieving long lengths of uniform fibre and in particular describe the fabrication of a 11 km long span of HC-PBGF with relatively low loss (~ 5 dB/km), wide bandwidth (~ 200 nm) and good longitudinal uniformity.
