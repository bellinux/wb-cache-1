5|$|During John's {{time in the}} Western North Pacific, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had {{particular}} difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of John. John weakened considerably after entering the Western North Pacific, and, before estimates were later revised, four consecutive advisories were issued that declared John a tropical depression. Each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation. As John persisted and did not dissipate as the JTWC had predicted, it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next <b>advisory.</b> At the same time, however, two separate ship reports indicated that John had sustained winds of at least 55 knots (100 km/h, 65 mph), far stronger than the <b>advisory</b> strength of 35 knots (65 km/h, 40 mph). John {{would go on to}} restrengthen into a strong Category 1 hurricane after reentering the Central North Pacific, defying all JTWC predictions. After later reanalysis, the JTWC raised the estimated wind speeds of John for every <b>advisory</b> from 1200 UTC September 1 to its final <b>advisory</b> exactly a week later by at least 5 knots (9 km/h, 6 mph) and as much as 25 knots (46 km/h, 29 mph).|$|E

On September25, a special <b>advisory</b> was issued for Bermuda as tropical storm-force winds were likely to impact the island. Following the unexpected intensification, another special <b>advisory</b> was issued stating that hurricane-force winds would impact the island during the day on September25.

40|$|Background: The North American Great Lakes {{are home}} to 3 ̆e 140 types of fish and are famous for {{recreational}} and commercial fishing. However, the presence of toxic substances {{has resulted in the}} issuance of fish consumption <b>advisories</b> that are typically based on the most restrictive contaminant. Objectives: We investigated whether these <b>advisories,</b> which typically neglect the existence of a mixture of chemicals and their possible additive adverse effects, are adequately protective of the health of humans consuming fish from the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes. Methods: Using recent fish contaminant monitoring data collected by the government of Ontario, Canada, we simulated <b>advisories</b> using most-restrictive-contaminant (one-chem) and multi-contaminant additive effect (multi-chem) approaches. The <b>advisories</b> from the two simulations were compared to determine if there is any deficiency in the currently issued <b>advisories.</b> Results: Approximately half of the <b>advisories</b> currently issued are potentially not adequately protective. Of the four Great Lakes studied, the highest percentage of <b>advisories</b> affected are in Lake Ontario if an additive effect is considered. Many fish that are popular for consumption, such as walleye, salmon, bass and trout, would have noticeably more stringent <b>advisories.</b> Conclusions: Improvements in the <b>advisories</b> may be needed to ensure that the health of humans consuming fish from the Great Lakes is protected. In this region, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury are the major contaminants causing restrictions on consuming fish, whereas dioxins/furans, toxaphene, and mirex/photomirex are of minor concern. Regular monitoring of most organochlorine pesticides and metals in fish can be discontinued. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|While fish <b>advisories</b> were {{necessary}} in the 1980 s to protect Mohawk health when GM’s contamination was first discovered, EPA has not made any concerted attempts to ensure that <b>advisories</b> will only be {{necessary in the}} short term (O’Neill 2003). While fish <b>advisories</b> are often necessary to protect human health {{in the short term}}, {{there is a need to}} emphasize more permanent and judicious fixes to problems of contamination. The EPA’s most recent Five Year Report about the GM site states that “remedial actions have been completed in the St. Lawrence River, Raquette River, and Turtle Cove, and, when combined with the existing fish <b>advisories,</b> these measures address unacceptable exposure pathways in these areas” (USEPA 2010 : ES 1; italics mine). This report takes for granted that fish <b>advisories</b> are an acceptable tool for preventing human exposure to contaminants, similar to a cap on the river bottom that isolates contaminated sediment. Acceptance of the ongoing fish <b>advisories</b> allows GM and the EPA to avoid a more thorough and permanent cleanup.|$|R

30|$|Much of the {{literature}} on fish <b>advisories</b> has focused on concerns about whether these <b>advisories</b> properly inform minority subsistence fishermen and their families about the risks of consuming contaminated fish (Chess et al. 2005; Beehler et al. 2003; Tan et al. 2011; Imm et al. 2005). Following a conventional human health risk model in which prevention of exposure protects health, the goal of much of this scholarship is ensuring that the fish avoidance message reaches all audiences. Less focus has been given to the impact on communities who follow these <b>advisories,</b> and the feasibility of ever reversing the impact of these <b>advisories</b> even after site cleanup.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Food {{consumption}} <b>advisories</b> {{are often}} posted when industrial activities {{are expected to}} affect the quality and availability of traditional foods used by First Nations. We were recently involved in a project and asked to summarize details regarding the impacts of traditional food consumption <b>advisories</b> with respect to compliance, broader changes in diet and loss of confidence in traditional foods by people. Methods Our review was not conducted as a formal systematic comprehensive review; rather, we focused on primary and grey literature presenting academic, health practitioner and First Nations viewpoints on the topic available from literature databases (i. e., PubMed, Web of Knowledge SM) {{as well as the}} internet search engine Google. Some information came from personal communications. Results Our overview suggests that when communicated effectively and clearly, and when community members are involved in the process, consumption <b>advisories</b> can result in a decrease in contaminant load in people. On the other hand, consumption <b>advisories</b> can lead to cultural loss and have been linked to a certain amount of social, psychological, nutritional, economic and lifestyle disruption. In some cases, communities have decided to ignore consumption <b>advisories</b> opting to continue with traditional lifestyles believing that the benefits of doing so outweigh the risk of following <b>advisories.</b> Conclusions We identified that there are both positive and negative aspects to the issuance of traditional food consumption <b>advisories.</b> A number of variables need to be recognized during {{the development and implementation of}} <b>advisories</b> in order to ensure a balance between human health, maintenance of cultures and industrial activity. </p...|$|R
