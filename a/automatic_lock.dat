50|$|Because they do {{not operate}} as {{smoothly}} as standard differentials, <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differentials are often responsible for increased tire wear. Some older <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differentials are known for making a clicking or banging noise when locking and unlocking as the vehicle negotiates turns. This is annoying to many drivers. Also, <b>automatic</b> <b>locking</b> differentials will affect {{the ability of a}} vehicle to steer, particularly if a locker is located in the front axle. Aside from tire scuffing while turning any degree on high friction (low slip) surfaces, locked axles provoke understeer and, if used on the front axle, will increase steering forces required to turn the vehicle. Furthermore, automatically locking differentials can cause a loss of control on ice where an open differential would allow one wheel to spin and the other to hold, while not transferring power. An example of this would be a vehicle parked sideways on a slippery grade. When both wheels spin, the vehicle will break traction and slide down the grade.|$|R

40|$|The {{allocation}} of lock objects to critical sections in concurrent programs affects both performance and correctness. Traditionally, this allocation is done manually by the programmer. Recent work explores <b>automatic</b> <b>lock</b> allocation, aiming primarily to minimize conflicts and maximize parallelism by allocating locks to individual critical sections. We investigate several modes of lock allocation, using connected components (groups) of interfering critical sections on a critical section interference graph {{as the basis}} for allocation decisions. Our allocator uses thread-based side effect analysis which is built from several pluggable component analyses. It benefits from precise points-to and may happen in parallel information. Thread-local object information provides a small improvement over points-to analysis alone. Our framework minimizes the restrictions on input programs, dealing gracefully with nesting and deadlock, and requiring only simple annotations identifying critical sections. Legacy programs using synchronized regions can be processed without alteration. We find that dynamic locks do not broadly improve upon identical allocations of static locks, but allocating several dynamic locks in place of a single static lock can significantly increase parallelism i...|$|E

40|$|The common gate found almost {{everywhere}} {{has a lot}} of problem in term of operation, it is energy consuming, stressful and above all costly in term of paying for the man responsible for opening and closing of such gates, this then requires a fast solution. The microcontroller based automatic gate control is a better solution for the elimination of these problems caused by the manually controlled gates. The system monitors the gate as vehicles enter and exit the gate it is being mounted. The microcontroller based automatic gate senses any vehicle approaching as it cut across the path of the Infra red ray. After sensing this, the gate then automatically opens, wait for some time and closes after the time elapsed. The systems also work as an <b>automatic</b> <b>lock,</b> when the lock button is pressed that is when it is ON the gate does not open even if a vehicle cross the Infrared path. There is a special thing about this automatic gate I did in this project and that is it is totally controlled by both software and hardware, if there is any need for modification it can be easily modified by changing some part of the software since the microcontroller used can be reprogrammed, or if there is a hardware failure this can be changed and the system will be alright. ...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe paper {{presented}} by NSWSES at the 1975 ITC Conference in Washington, DC, described the Portable High Frequency Telemetry System (PUTTS) being assembled for NATO. This system used {{the best of}} the then standard state of the arts commercial components and was used for shipboard missile data receiving/recording and for quick look missile performance evaluation. In 1977 the Naval Sea Systems Command made funds available to update the AN/SKQ- 3 system by utilizing the RF assembly similar to that used in PUTTS. This new RF assembly provided dual antennas for (1) a wide angle for verticle launch and initial acquisition; (2) narrow beam high gain for long range tracking. The RF unit also included frequency scan with <b>automatic</b> <b>lock</b> when a signal was received, and sector search. In 1978 funding was received from Australia and Iran to procure additional PUTTS. These units (PUTTS III) were updated to handle faster intercept rates as well as improved range tracking and adapt the new RF features from the SKQ- 3 Mod. Added to this were the capability to handle both PAM and PCM data with light weight hardware. These systems were completed and the Australian unit system was delivered after acceptance tests with U. S. fleet operation in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of these successful improvements a new portable system has been built to (1) adapt microprocessors to the set-up of data format; (2) Provide automatic selection remote control of the RF head within the antenna frame; (3) provide the basic data to make automatic processing possible when and if desired; (4) Add the new low noise GASFET preamp to the system to increase the range; (5) Add capability for four receivers in the space presently occupied by the dual receivers to permit the handling of the new missiles with dual RF outputs and (6) provide the capability of system checking of all modules from the antenna through the system to the paper read-out device. This paper now presents the new updated system combining {{the state of the art}} development in programming, remote control, low noise preamps, miniature RF assembly, matrix control programming as well as automatic data set up and selection for data processing...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the recent}} years MALDI-Imaging {{analysis}} has gained high interest and the ever {{increasing number of}} publication demonstrates its wide applicability. The {{aim of this study}} is to employ MALDI-FTMS Imaging to gain insight into interactions between microorganisms and higher organisms. The infection of potatoes with phytopathogenic bacteria of the Streptomyces genus is the cause for substantial loss in crop harvest. Thus the understanding of this interaction might lead to more efficient treatments to protect the crop. Using MALDI-FTMS imaging, any compound of interest can be assigned to an unique elemental composition by making use of the intrinsic mass accuracy of FTMS, its high resolution and the capability to use isotopic fine structures. Methods: Potato tuber sterilized in hot water, 70 % ethanol, 0. 05 % citric acid. Inoculation in Petri dishes with perlite and 200 ?l mycelium. After 5 days the tuber was cut using a cryotome, slices were mounted on ITO slides (Bruker Daltonics). Matrix applicaton by vibrational nebulizing device (ImagePrep, Bruker Daltonics). MALDI-MS: HCCA coated slides were loaded into a 12 T FTMS (solariX, Bruker Daltonics). MALDI images: Pixel size 50 ?m. For each pixel a single scan was recorded consisting of 200 laser shots (rep. rate 1 KHz). For each scan, an 8 MWord spectrum was acquired (m/z range 130 ? 1500), up to 18. 000 pixels per given imaging experiment. External calibration: Arginine clusters (electrospray mode). <b>Automatic</b> <b>lock</b> mass calibration: Matrix peak ([2 M+H]+). Preliminary Data: Here we present results from an incubation experiment of a Streptomyces bottropensis on slices of potato tubers. During the analysis of the imaging data mass peaks were detected which were not seen in prior LC-MS/MS experiments conducted using extracts of similar inoculation experiments. These peaks gave rise to secondary metabolites emerging from S. bottropensis under these cultivation conditions. By using the high mass accuracy and mass resolving power of the FTMS we could unambiguously identify the elemental compositions of these compounds directly from the plant tissue. Key to this data assignment is the possibility to make use of the Isotopic Fine Structure (IFS), which limits the number of putative elemental compositions substantially. The series of compounds is detected as protonated species and potassium adducts which are both used for the assignment of the elemental compositions. The derived compostions (C 27 H 48 N 6 On; 5 <n< 10) suggest that these metabolites are siderophores which enable the microorganism to sustain the physiological Fe-concentration. Comparing the distributions through a vertical slice of a potato the newly detected compounds are co-located with known Iromycins. The mass measurement accuracy was well below 1 ppm...|$|E
