A {{clear understanding of}} usage behavior in real hotspots is critical information for those who develop, deploy, and manage WLAN technology {{as well as those}} who develop systems and application software for wireless networks. This thesis analyzes user behavior and network performance in public wireless networks in Helsinki, collecting traffic traces over several days at different access points. The analysis covers locations, which provide hotspots connectivity in different social environments including, libraries, museums or cafeterias. The capture process focuses of <b>open</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> infrastructures, where the access to the Internet is free and becoming ubiquitous. This enables the study of user behavior in urban environments. The first part of the thesis introduces the research field on a general basis, a literature survey is given to present the current state-of-art. The survey covers technologies and issues in open WLAN networks, relevant terminology and privacy aspects concerning the traffic collection. The performed research and capture methodology is then presented. The focus is on the challenges in wireless monitoring and data collection. The findings and part of the thesis discusses the results from the capture analysis to evaluate the Internet usage in a public wireless LAN environment. As an outcome, the thesis describes how free hotspots provide services to a diverse population that use the WLAN through <b>open</b> <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> In particular, web based applications are the most popular with the clients in this study.

Faeces and accumulated nesting material build-up on the various external structures of the campus buildings have become an issue of concern.

We continue our study based on realistic vehicular mobility traces of downtown Portland, Oregon, obtained from extremely detailed large scale traffic simulations performed at the Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL). This mobility model is used to evaluate both flat and opportunistic infrastructure routing. We here build upon [1] and extend that work to: (a) assess the impact of a range of mobility models on network performance and; (b) discuss the performance trend we may expect during the day, as urban mobility patterns change.
