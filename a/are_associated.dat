40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only with the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991 and 2000. An increase in M 1, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crises in 1993, 2000 and 2001...|$|R

30|$|From the HKT {{subfamily}} II, OsHKT 2; 1 gene {{had five}} SNPs in the promoter region showing {{association with the}} salt tolerance traits.

In OsHKT 2; 3 a total of 4 SNPs <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> with the salt tolerance traits. Of the two non-synonymous SNPs, S 1001 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with potassium concentration in shoot (extracellular side) while S 761 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with SPAD chlorophyll content (cytoplasmic side), both the SNPs resulted in Isoleucine to Threonine substitution at amino acid positions 157 and 77, respectively. In addition, one synonymous SNP S 2053 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with SPAD chlorophyll content and another SNP S 356 in the intronic region <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with potassium concentration in shoot.

5|$|The {{likelihood}} of developing paralytic polio increases with age, {{as does the}} extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis {{is the most likely}} consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases. In children under five years of age, paralysis of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive paralysis of the chest and abdomen also affecting all four limbs—quadriplegia—is more likely. Paralysis rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the highest rates of paralysis (one in 200) <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> with type 2.|$|E
