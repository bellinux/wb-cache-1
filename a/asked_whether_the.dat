5|$|In 1938 Horne {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on a {{part-time}} training scheme. He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer in No. 911 (County of Warwick) Squadron, a barrage balloon unit in Sutton Coldfield, and was called up into the RAF full-time on the outbreak of war. In the initial months of the conflict—the Phoney War—Horne's duties were undemanding, and he formed a concert party from his friends and colleagues. In November 1940 {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant, and to squadron leader a year later. In early 1942, the BBC producer Bill McLurg <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> RAF station at which Horne was based could put on an edition of his programme Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. Horne was ordered to put on the show, and he made his broadcasting debut on 16 April 1942, as the compere. Although the standard of the talent on the show was not high, McLurg was impressed with Horne's presentation, especially the way he hosted the programme's quiz; he invited Horne to be the programme's regular quizmaster, a role the latter fulfilled on over fifty Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer quizzes over the next two years. In January 1943 {{he became one of the}} show's regular comperes and presented the entire show for the first time.|$|E

25|$|When Elisha heard, {{he invited}} the king to send Naaman to him, and so Naaman came to Elisha's {{house with his}} horses and his chariots. Elisha sent a {{messenger}} to Naaman {{to tell him to}} wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave his hands over Naaman. Naaman <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, so that he might wash in them and be clean.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the HSR network in China was initially delayed by a debate over the type of track technology to be used. In June 1998, at a State Council meeting with the Chinese Academies of Sciences and Engineering, Premier Zhu Rongji <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> high-speed railway between Beijing and Shanghai still being planned could use maglev technology. At the time, planners were divided between using high-speed trains with wheels that run on conventional standard gauge tracks or magnetic levitation trains that run on special maglev tracks for a new national high-speed rail network.|$|E

25|$|In the referendum, {{voters were}} <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Saar should remain under League of Nations administration, return to Germany or {{become part of}} France. To the {{surprise}} of neutral observers as well as (to some extent) the Nazis themselves, over 90% voted in favour of reuniting with Germany. Every voting district saw at least 83% of voters support returning the Saar to German rule. Meanwhile, despite Georges Clemenceau's previous claim that there were 150,000 Frenchmen in the Saar, less than 1% of voters supported the annexation of the Saar by France.|$|E
25|$|In November 1935, the {{operation}} of Noemijulia was again raised in Parliament. George Oliver <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Board of Trade was aware that Noemijulias radio installation was defective, and what measures were being taken to correct this. Leslie Burgin replied that the Board was aware, and had requested that the ship be detained should she visit certain countries which had adopted the 1929 Safety Convention, but so far she had not docked at any port belonging {{to one of the}} signatories. In January 1936, Noemijulia arrived at Antwerp, Belgium, where she was detained. She was still detained in March as the defects in her radio and other defects had not been remedied.|$|E
25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president had to answer the questions. However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E

25|$|Convoy US 3's {{destination}} changed {{following the}} German invasion of France on 10 May 1940, which further increased {{the probability that}} Italy would enter the war. On 15 May the British Government proposed again that Convoy US 3 be diverted to the UK. The Australian Chiefs of Staff endorsed this proposal, but the Australian War Cabinet remained reluctant to agree to it. Instead, the War Cabinet <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> troops could be sent to either South Africa or North-West India to complete their training before joining the 6th Division in Egypt. After being advised that accommodation and equipment were {{not likely to be}} available in either location, the War Cabinet agreed on 19 May for Convoy US 3 to proceed to the UK. At this time the Allied forces in France were rapidly retreating. The New Zealand Government also agreed for its forces on Convoy US 3 to be sent to the UK.|$|E
500|$|That day, Hirohito {{informed}} the imperial family {{of his decision}} to surrender.

500|$|Although ABS-CBN {{officials}} {{stated that}} this occurrence with the then-new game was a [...] "mechanical glitch" [...] and an honest mistake, controversy erupted as many critics <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> mistake {{was a sign}} that the show—or at least this portion of the show—could be or was rigged.|$|E
50|$|When an {{arbitrator}} {{looks at}} a discipline dispute, <b>the</b> arbitrator first <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> employee's wrongdoing has been proven by the employer, and then <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> method of discipline should be upheld or modified. In 1966, an arbitrator, Professor Carroll Daugherty, expanded these principles into seven tests for just cause. The concepts encompassed within his seven tests are still frequently used by arbitrators when deciding discipline cases.|$|R
