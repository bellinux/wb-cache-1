25|$|In 1999, {{because of}} the PSC growth, Convergence and Union had lost the vote share for the first time, but had won the most seats due to the disproportionate <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona respect to Barcelona. Thanks to {{the support of the}} PPC, Pujol had been able to be re-elected to a sixth term in office. In spite of this, and despite Pujol's {{approval}} ratings remaining high, rumours about his possible retirement and a desire for change had resulted in CiU trailing the PSC in opinion polls for the entire legislature, with a lead nearly into the double digits by mid-to-late 2002. From mid-2003, however, the Socialist lead had begun to narrow to the point that speculation arose about a possible reenactment of the 1999 results.|$|E
500|$|Just under 10 {{million people}} voted, with an {{abstention}} rate of 28 percent, {{a level of}} apathy higher than might be suggested by the ongoing political violence. A small number of coerced voters and anarchists formed part of the abstainers. The elections of 1936 were narrowly won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right, who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The exact numbers of votes differ among historians; Brenan assigns the Popular Front 4,700,000 votes, the Right around 4,000,000 and the centre 450,000. It was a comparatively narrow victory in terms of votes, but Paul Preston describes it as a 'triumph {{of power in the}} Cortes' [...] the Popular Front won 267 deputies and the Right only 132, and the imbalance caused by the nature of Spain's electoral system since the 1932 election law came into force. The same system had benefited the political right in 1933. The political centre did badly. Lerroux's Radicals, incumbent until his government's collapse, were electorally devastated; many of their supporters had been pushed to the right by the increasing instability in Spain. Portela Valladares had formed the Centre Party, but had not had time to build it up. Worried about the problems of a minority party losing out due to the electoral system, he made a pact with the right, but this was not enough to ensure success. Leaders of the centre, Lerroux, Cambó and Melquíades Álvarez, failed to win seats. The Falangist party, under José Antonio Primo de Rivera received only 46,000 votes, a very small fraction of the total cast. This seemed to show little appetite for a takeover of that sort. The <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> between coalition members was a matter of agreement between them. The official results (...) were recorded on 20 February. The Basque Party, who had not {{at the time of the}} election been part of the Popular Front, would go on to join it. In 20 seats, no alliance or party had secured 40% of the vote; 17 were decided by a second vote on 3 March. In these runoffs, the Popular Front won 8, the Basques 5, the Right 5 and the Centre 2. In May, elections were reheld in two areas of Granada where the new government alleged there had been fraud; both seats were taken from the national Right victory in February by the Left.|$|E

2500|$|One {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} the repeal of section 127 was that full inclusion of Indigenous people in the census became mandatory and the Aboriginal populace {{was reflected in the}} <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in the House of Representatives between the states. [...] Collection of sound and systematic data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) replaced the previous inadequate data collections. [...] The availability of these demographic data following the 1971 census enabled the systematic determination and monitoring of key health indicators such as infant mortality rates and life expectancy. [...] Aboriginal life expectancy remains significantly lower than the average population, though the situation has been improving. [...] ABS data from the early 1990s showed life expectancy at birth for Indigenous men to be 18 years shorter than for their non-Indigenous counterparts, and 17 years shorter for women. [...] By 2010–2012, the life expectancy at birth for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has risen to 69.1 years for males and 73.7 years for females, which still lagged around 10 years behind the expectancies for the non-Indigenous population. Infant mortality rates in the early 1970s were {{among the highest in the}} world. Substantial improvements had occurred by the early 1990s but Aboriginal health indicators still lag behind those of the total population, especially for those living in remote areas, and closing the gap policies remain an ongoing part of governance in Australia.|$|E
60|$|The Committee {{returned}} to this country, bringing {{with them the}} recommendation that the Government on their own responsibility should fix the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> at that very point where the agreement of one Party was still preserved and where the agreement of the other was so very nearly won. And {{that is what we}} have decided to do. We have decided to allocate thirty-four seats, including Krugersdorp Rural, to the Rand, six to Pretoria, and twenty-nine {{to the rest of the}} country. Lord Selborne wishes it to be known that he concurs in this arrangement. Now I am quite ready to admit that every Constitution ought to rest either upon symmetry or upon acceptance. Our Transvaal Constitution does not rest upon either symmetry or acceptance, but it is very near symmetry and very near acceptance, and in so far as it has departed from symmetry it has moved towards acceptance, and is furthermore sustained throughout by fair dealing, for I am honestly convinced that the addition of an extra member to the Witwatersrand areas which has been made is justified by the increase of the population which has taken place since the census.|$|E
