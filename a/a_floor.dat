5|$|A. ^ General Motors, {{the owner}} of the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center, {{maintains}} that the building has 73 floors. Hines Interests, the property management firm for the building, gives <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> count of 74, while architect Skidmore, Owings and Merrill gives <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> count of 75. Emporis and other building database sites usually give the floor count as 70, while other sources state 73 stories. This table uses the floor count of 73 as stated officially by the building's owner.|$|E
5|$|Ravenscroft {{commissioned}} the architect Thomas Edward Knightley {{to design the}} new hall. Using <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> plan previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual elevation of the building, with the grand tier at street level, and the stalls and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting {{was a combination of}} gas and electricity.|$|E

5|$|Failing {{to gather}} enough support for <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> vote {{in either the}} House or the Senate (although Democrats {{controlled}} both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44percent in April 1994 and 35percent by September 1994.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E

5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills.

Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> peg.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era {{before the advent of}} the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, <b>a</b> <b>floor,</b> or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E
5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E

5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|Most {{buildings}} in Bath {{are made from}} the local, golden-coloured Bath Stone, and many date from the 18th and 19th century. The dominant style of architecture in Central Bath is Georgian; this style evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent architects of the day were employed {{in the development of}} the city. The original purpose of much of Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, <b>a</b> <b>floor,</b> or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants. The masons Reeves of Bath were prominent in the city from the 1770s to 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E

50|$|The playing {{surface in}} Western Hall has {{undergone}} several {{changes in its}} history.

While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, <b>a</b> <b>floor</b> is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
