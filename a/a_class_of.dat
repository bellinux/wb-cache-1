5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> particles called bosons and <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E
