5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the {{specimens}} belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E

5|$|On the Rochester end, NY33 {{primarily}} {{serves as}} a paralleling local route to Interstate490 (I-490), of less importance to the area's traffic patterns. Between the two cities, it is mostly a rural two-lane highway. The largest location on this stretch is the Genesee County city of Batavia, where NY33 reconnects to NY5 and crosses NY63 and NY98, two regionally important north–south highways. NY33 overlaps with all three routes <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another as it traverses Batavia. A southerly alternate route, designated NY33A, leaves NY33 northeast of Batavia in Bergen and rejoins its parent in Rochester.|$|E

25|$|Polls {{over the}} course of the {{campaign}} indicated that the race was very competitive, with many polls showing Franken and Coleman virtually tied or within the margin of error, as well as several polls showing each candidate with a significant lead <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another.

25|$|Forty-two {{different}} sports, spanning 55 different disciplines, {{have been}} part of the Olympic program <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another. Twenty-eight sports have comprised the schedule for three of the recent games, 2000, 2004, and 2008 Summer Olympics.

500|$|To Bamber's supporters, who {{over the}} years have {{included}} MPs and journalists, he is a victim of one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice. The Guardian took up his case <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> <b>One</b> <b>or</b> more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote that there was something about him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference.... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions." [...] He is reported to have passed a lie detector test in 2007.|$|R
50|$|Hósvík was <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> called Thórsvík <b>or</b> Thors Bay, but {{was renamed}} to Hósvík. It was called Thors Bay {{because of the}} founder, who was {{believed}} to be called Tórhallur.|$|R
50|$|In {{analytic}} geometry, a {{line and}} a sphere can intersect in three ways: no intersection at all, <b>at</b> exactly <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>or</b> in two <b>points.</b> Methods for distinguishing these cases, and determining equations for the points in the latter cases, are useful {{in a number of}} circumstances. For example, this is a common calculation to perform during ray tracing (Eberly 2006:698).|$|R

25|$|During {{their time}} {{together}} Erica and Dimitri have lived in two castles <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another.

25|$|From –, {{only six}} teams (the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs) {{played in the}} NHL. With so few opponents, teams played more {{frequently}} and games were often underscored by personal rivalries between players. These personal and team rivalries lasted for many years, as the turnover rate on NHL rosters was very low. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another, during this era, all the teams had animosity towards one another.|$|E
25|$|The {{changes were}} {{accompanied}} by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that {{can be traced to}} the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.|$|E
25|$|Initially Camilleri {{used the}} group to play gigs in local cafes after the {{dissolution}} of his previous band, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons. From 1983 to 1988 he used the name Joey Vincent for his work with the band. Membership in the band has been loose and fluid. Most of The Falcons, <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another, have been members; numerous other Australian musicians have drifted {{in and out of}} the line-ups.

25|$|Canadian syllabics are {{currently}} {{used to write}} all of the Cree languages from Naskapi (spoken in Quebec) to the Rocky Mountains, including Eastern Cree, Woods Cree, Swampy Cree and Plains Cree. They are also used to write Inuktitut in the eastern Canadian Arctic; there they are co-official with the Latin script in the territory of Nunavut. They are used regionally for the other large Canadian Algonquian language, Ojibwe in Western Canada, {{as well as for}} Blackfoot, where they are obsolete. Among the Athabaskan languages further to the west, syllabics have been used <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another to write Dakelh (Carrier), Chipewyan, Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) and Dane-zaa (Beaver). Syllabics have occasionally been used in the United States by communities that straddle the border, but are principally a Canadian phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} {{discussion}} about the names adopted {{for most of the}} colleges with the following alternative names all in consideration <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another: for Eliot: Caxton, after William Caxton; for Keynes: Richborough, a town in Kent; Anselm, a former Archbishop of Canterbury; and for Darwin: Anselm (again); Attlee, after Clement Attlee, the post war Prime Minister; Becket, after Thomas Becket, another former Archbishop (this was the recommendation of the college's provisional committee but rejected by the Senate); Conrad; Elgar, after Edward Elgar; Maitland; Marlowe, after Christopher Marlowe; Russell, after Bertrand Russell (this was the recommendation of the Senate but rejected by the Council); Tyler, after both Wat Tyler and Tyler Hill on which the campus stands. The name for the College proved especially contentious and was eventually decided by a postal ballot of members of the Senate, choosing from: Attlee, Conrad, Darwin, Elgar, Maitland, Marlowe and Tyler.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other regions}} of the American colonies, the region that is now Montgomery County saw protests against British {{taxation}} in the years before the American Revolution. In 1774, local residents met at Hungerford's Tavern and agreed to break off commerce with Great Britain. Following the signing of the Declaration of Independence, representatives of the area helped to draft the new state constitution and began to build a Maryland free of proprietary control. On September 6, 1776, the Maryland Constitutional Convention formed Montgomery County from lands that had <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another been part of Charles, Prince George's and Frederick Counties, naming it after General Richard Montgomery. The leaders of the new county chose as their county seat an area adjacent to Hungerford's Tavern {{near the center of the}} county, which later became Rockville. The newly formed Montgomery County supplied arms, food and forage for the Continental Army during the Revolution, in addition to soldiers.|$|E
