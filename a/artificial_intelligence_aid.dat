Here, we review the value of cabled videoobservatories as a new and reliable technology for the remote, long-term, and highfrequency monitoring of fishes and their environment in coastal temperate areas. We provide details on the methodological requirements and constraints to appropriately measure fish behaviour at day-night and seasonal temporal scales from fixed videostations. In doing so, we highlight the relevance of an accurate monitoring capacity of the surrounding environmental variability. We present examples of multiparametric video, oceanographic, and meteorological monitoring made with the western Mediterranean platform OBSEA (www. obsea. es; 20 m water depth).

40|$|Abstract] The {{successful}} high throughput {{screening of}} molecule libraries {{for a specific}} biological property {{is one of the}} main improvements in drug discovery. The virtual molecular filtering and screening relies greatly on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, a mathematical model that correlates the activity of a molecule with molecular descriptors. QSAR models have the potential to reduce the costly failure of drug candidates in advanced (clinical) stages by filtering combinatorial libraries, eliminating candidates with a predicted toxic effect and poor pharmacokinetic profiles, and reducing the number of experiments. To obtain a predictive and reliable QSAR model, scientists use methods from various fields such as molecular modeling, pattern recognition, machine learning or <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> QSAR modeling relies on three main steps: molecular structure codification into molecular descriptors, selection of relevant variables in the context of the analyzed activity, and search of the optimal mathematical model that correlates the molecular descriptors with a specific activity. Since a variety of techniques from statistics and <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can <b>aid</b> variable selection and model building steps, this review focuses on the evolutionary computation methods supporting these tasks. Thus, this review explains the basic of the genetic algorithms and genetic programming as evolutionary computation approaches, the selection methods for high-dimensional data in QSAR, the methods to build QSAR models, the current evolutionary feature selection methods and applications in QSAR and the future trend on the joint or multi-task feature selection methods.

Diel (i. e., 24 -h based), seasonal activity rhythms, or longer durational in behavioral responses can result in shifts in populations, and therefore on measurable abundances.

We provide details on the methodological requirements and constraints for the appropriate measurement of fish behavior over various seasonal scales (24 h, seasonal, annual) with camera systems mounted at fixed observatory locations.

The High Volume Operation concept, proposed by the NASA Small Aircraft Transportation System program, is based on an environment within which the decisionmaking is distributed mostly to the pilot. Realization of this concept relies on advanced cockpit systems that assist pilots in both information-processing and decision-making. This paper introduces an onboard pilot decision aid system called the Small Aircraft Pilot Assistant, which is dedicated to Small Aircraft Transportation System aircraft conducting High Volume Operations. The goal is to increase cockpit decision-making capacity by automating part of the pilot decision-making process, especially {{in the early stages of}} information acquisition and analysis. The Small Aircraft Pilot Assistant uses <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligence</b> techniques to <b>aid</b> pilots in following the High Volume Operation procedures, identifying the current flight segment, monitoring performance, advising of possible pilot mis-operation; and warning of potential traffic related hazards.
