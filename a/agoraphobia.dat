5|$|In the United States, {{alprazolam}} is FDA-approved for {{the treatment}} of panic disorder with or without <b>agoraphobia.</b> Alprazolam is recommended by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder where there is no history of tolerance or dependence.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1863, {{twelve days}} after his sixteenth birthday, Prus {{took part in a}} battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four {{kilometers}} south of Siedlce. He suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
5|$|After having sold Pharaoh to the {{publishing}} firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked, on 16 May 1895, on a four-month journey abroad. He visited Berlin, Dresden, Karlsbad, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and Rapperswil. At the latter Swiss town he stayed two months (July–August), nursing his <b>agoraphobia</b> and spending {{much time with}} his friends, the promising young writer Stefan Żeromski and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus' help for the Polish National Museum, housed in the Rapperswil Castle, where Żeromski was librarian.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was {{prevented}} by his <b>agoraphobia</b> from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll {{had been on the}} mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the last that he would make abroad.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} effects of benzodiazepine use can include cognitive impairment as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, <b>agoraphobia</b> and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use. Additionally, an altered perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and <b>agoraphobia.</b> Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without <b>agoraphobia</b> is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} present {{to mental health}} specialists develop <b>agoraphobia</b> after the onset of panic disorder. <b>Agoraphobia</b> is best {{understood}} as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur. Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent <b>agoraphobia.</b> <b>Agoraphobia</b> is typically determined when symptoms are worse than panic disorder, but also {{do not meet the}} criteria for other anxiety disorders such as depression. In rare cases where agoraphobics do not meet the criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of <b>agoraphobia</b> without history of panic disorder is used (primary <b>agoraphobia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Panic {{disorder}} with {{or without}} <b>agoraphobia</b> affects roughly 5.1% of Americans, and about 1/3 of this population with panic disorder have comorbid <b>agoraphobia.</b> It is uncommon to have <b>agoraphobia</b> without panic attacks, with only 0.17% of people with agorophobia not presenting panic disorders as well.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco smoking {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the development and emergence of <b>agoraphobia,</b> often with panic disorder; it is uncertain how tobacco smoking results in anxiety-panic with or without <b>agoraphobia</b> symptoms, but the direct effects of nicotine dependence or the effects of tobacco smoke on breathing have been suggested as possible causes. Self-medication or a combination of factors may also explain the association between tobacco smoking and <b>agoraphobia</b> and panic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have explained <b>agoraphobia</b> as an attachment deficit, i.e., the temporary {{loss of the}} ability to tolerate spatial separations from a secure base. Recent empirical research has also linked attachment and spatial theories of <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{the exact}} causes of <b>agoraphobia</b> are unknown, some clinicians who have treated or {{attempted}} to treat <b>agoraphobia</b> offer plausible hypotheses. The condition {{has been linked}} to the presence of other anxiety disorders, a stressful environment, or substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{movement}} desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) {{has been}} studied as a possible treatment for <b>agoraphobia,</b> with poor results. As such, EMDR is only recommended in cases where cognitive-behavioral approaches have proven ineffective or in cases where <b>agoraphobia</b> has developed following trauma.|$|E
25|$|Panic {{disorder}} with {{or without}} <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the social}} sciences, a {{perceived}} clinical bias exists in <b>agoraphobia</b> research. Branches {{of the social}} sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested {{in what may be}} thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of <b>agoraphobia</b> with modernity. Factors considered contributing to <b>agoraphobia</b> within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of private space on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobic-prone people a tense, unbridgeable gulf between the two.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is {{prescribed}} for epilepsy and panic disorder {{with or without}} <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic use of tranquilizers and {{sleeping}} pills such as benzodiazepines {{has been linked}} to onset of <b>agoraphobia.</b> In 10 patients who had developed <b>agoraphobia</b> during benzodiazepine dependence, symptoms abated within the first year of assisted withdrawal. Similarly, alcohol use disorders are associated with panic with or without agoraphobia; this association {{may be due to the}} long-term effects of alcohol misuse causing a distortion in brain chemistry.|$|E
25|$|The sufferers can {{sometimes}} {{go to great}} lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack. <b>Agoraphobia,</b> as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder. Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also cause <b>agoraphobia.</b> Essentially, any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressant {{medications}} {{most commonly}} used to treat anxiety disorders are mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and tricyclic antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed for treatment of <b>agoraphobia.</b> Antidepressants are important because some have antipanic effects. Antidepressants {{should be used in}} conjunction with exposure as a form of self-help or with cognitive behaviour therapy. A combination of medication and cognitive behaviour therapy is sometimes the most effective treatment for <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Agoraphobia</b> is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families, and stressful events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger. In the DSM-5 <b>agoraphobia</b> is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder. Those affected are at higher risk of depression and substance use disorder.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2010, Ben Weasel {{appeared}} on Last Call with Carson Daly {{to talk about}} his personal problems with anxiety disorders and <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Agoraphobia</b> occurs {{about twice}} as {{commonly}} among women {{as it does in}} men. The gender difference may be attributable to several factors: sociocultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of avoidance coping strategies by women (including dependent and helpless behaviors), women perhaps being more likely to seek help and therefore be diagnosed, and men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic. Research has not yet produced a single clear explanation for the gender difference in <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shirley Jackson (1916–1965), American writer – her <b>agoraphobia</b> is {{considered}} to be a primary inspiration for the novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{restructuring}} {{has also}} proved useful in treating <b>agoraphobia.</b> This treatment involves coaching a participant through a dianoetic discussion, {{with the intent}} of replacing irrational, counterproductive beliefs with more factual and beneficial ones.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} whose panic disorder involves <b>agoraphobia,</b> the traditional cognitive therapy {{approach has been}} in vivo exposure, in which the affected individual, accompanied by a therapist, is gradually exposed to the actual situation that provokes panic.|$|E
25|$|Early in his career, Ward was {{involved}} in two near-fatal incidents. He was {{run over by a}} car just outside his office, and he later received incorrect medical treatment while hyperventilating in an airplane. He then developed <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Spanish apocalyptic {{science fiction}} film, Los Últimos Días (2013), some news reporters {{speculate}} that three recent eruptions of Mount Hekla {{could have caused}} the spreading form of <b>agoraphobia</b> that kills affected people who go outside.|$|E
25|$|Because of the spasms, {{patients}} may become increasingly fearful, require assistance, and lose {{the ability to}} work, leading to depression, anxiety, and phobias, including <b>agoraphobia</b> and dromophobia. Most patients are psychologically normal and respond reasonably to their situations.|$|E
25|$|A panic-agoraphobia spectrum. Due to the {{heterogeneity}} (diversity) found in individual clinical presentations of panic disorder and <b>agoraphobia,</b> {{attempts have been}} made to identify symptom clusters in addition to those included in the DSM diagnoses, including through the development of a dimensional questionnaire measure.|$|E
25|$|H.L. Gold (1914–1996), {{science fiction}} editor – {{as a result}} of trauma during his wartime experiences, his <b>agoraphobia</b> became so severe that {{for more than two decades}} he was unable to leave his apartment. Towards the end of his life, he {{acquired}} some control over the condition.|$|E
25|$|Escitalopram has FDA {{approval}} {{for the treatment of}} major depressive disorder in adolescents and adults, and generalized anxiety disorder in adults. In European countries and Australia, it is approved for depression (MDD) and certain anxiety disorders: general anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder with or without <b>agoraphobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|During Superman's rampage and {{destruction}} on Earth 2, Lois {{is among a}} group that discovers Val-Zod, a Kryptonian, hidden in a cell beneath Arkham. Lois helps Val feel accepted and welcomed on Earth 2, learn to control his superpower, and overcome his <b>agoraphobia</b> (due to his prolonged travel in space to Earth). Val-Zod eventually becomes the new Superman of Earth 2.|$|E
25|$|By 2002, the {{laboratory}} had expanded {{to the point}} that it received subsidies from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), which gave added impetus to the work in progress, including projects involving the use of videoconferencing in the treatment of panic disorder with <b>agoraphobia,</b> and the use of virtual reality in the treatment of anxiety disorders.|$|E
25|$|Perceived threat {{control has}} been {{identified}} as a moderator within panic disorder, moderating the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobia; thus, the level of perceived threat control dictates the degree to which anxiety sensitivity results in <b>agoraphobia.</b> Another recently identified moderator of panic disorder is genetic variations in the gene coding for galanin; these genetic variations moderate the relationship between females suffering from panic disorder and the level of severity of panic disorder symptomatology.|$|E
25|$|In Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, Gwenhwyfar {{is brought}} up by a cold, unloving father, which leaves her with a deep inferiority complex and intense <b>agoraphobia.</b> Failing to produce an heir and unable {{to be with the}} love of her life, Lancelot, she falls into a deep {{depression}} and – hoping for salvation – becomes an increasingly fanatical Christian. Bradley's version is notable for popularizing the Welsh spelling, which many subsequent writers have adopted.|$|E
25|$|MAOIs {{have been}} found to be {{effective}} in the treatment of panic disorder with <b>agoraphobia,</b> social phobia, atypical depression or mixed anxiety and depression, bulimia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as borderline personality disorder. MAOIs appear to be particularly effective in the management of bipolar depression according to a recent retrospective-analysis. There are reports of MAOI efficacy in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania, dysmorphophobia, and avoidant personality disorder, but these reports are from uncontrolled case reports.|$|E
