5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with <b>all</b> <b>available</b> forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} {{advancing}} army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised {{to give him the}} title of magister militum for life and to confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn <b>all</b> <b>available</b> fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|Jurassic Park was {{broadcast}} on television {{for the first}} time on May 7, 1995, following the April 26 airing of The Making of Jurassic Park.

Jurassic Park was the highest-rated theatrical film broadcast on television by any network since the April 1987 airing of Trading Places. In June–July 1995 the film was aired a number of times on the TNT network.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodical}} cicadas (Magicicada) {{make use}} of predator satiation: they emerge, all at once, at long intervals of 13 or 17 years; their juveniles are probably the longest-lived of all insect development stages.

5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of <b>all</b> <b>available</b> studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, {{was built}} around a core of four infantry battalions. Three of these were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting {{since the start of}} the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not <b>all</b> <b>available</b> at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E

Mechanic Mack questions why Coulson would risk lives just to steal a quinjet, but Coulson explains that they need its ability to literally disappear, something they currently cannot do themselves following the injuries engineer Agent Leo Fitz recently suffered {{at the hands of}} Ward; he now struggles with technology and hallucinates the presence of Agent Jemma Simmons, who left S.H.I.E.L.D. some time earlier because of Fitz's condition.|$|E
5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of <b>all</b> <b>available</b> space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as <b>all</b> <b>available</b> vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
