Station Outlets are typically equipped with safety systems that prevent cross-connection errors, such as connecting a Medical <b>air</b> <b>flowmeter</b> to an Oxygen port. Hospitals mainly use DISS connections, though {{a wide variety of}} quick-connect adapters, based on male strikers and female outlet ports, are still in use today. These latter types are easier to connect, but are more prone to leaks and failure.|$|E

The flowmeter body {{is made up}} of the low stress silicon nitride, and the nanometer sized piezoresistive layer is deposited with FIB system for the smaller measuring area. The flowmeter is evaluated in the wind tunnel, and the 0 ~ 4 m/s air flows are applied. Although the sensitivity, ∆R/R shows the negative behavior unlike the conventional piezoresistive layer due to the added materials during the FIB process, the measurement results show the ∆R/R has a suitable sensitivity (- 1. 04 E- 2 /ms- 1) and a rapid response time (0. 8 sec). Those results represent the fabricated piezoresistive type <b>air</b> <b>flowmeter</b> has the possibility for the small area detection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Experiments were {{conducted}} to quantify the effects of entrapped air on water infiltration into a loamy sand. Transparent three-dimensional (3 -D) and 2 -D columns were used for experiments carried out for two infiltration conditions: (1) when air was free to move ahead of the wetting front and leave {{the bottom of the}} column (air draining) and (2) when air was confined ahead of the wetting front and hence could escape only through the soil surface (air confining). The measurement setup was composed of a tension-pressure infiltrometer, an <b>air</b> <b>flowmeter,</b> water manometers, and video-picture cameras. We applied both positive and negative water pressures at the soil surface and measured the simultaneous changes in the rates of water inflow and air outflow, the air pressure ahead of the wetting front, and the dynamic behavior and advance of the wetting front. The air pressure ahead of the wetting front for the air-confining condition was generally found to increase with time rather than reaching a constant level, as observed in other studies by other researchers. The air pressure fluctuated locally because of air escaping from the soil surface. On the basis of an analysis of the results we present two empirical equations to predict the maximum air pressure at which air begins to erupt from the soi...|$|E
