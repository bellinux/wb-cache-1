40|$|Phenols <b>and</b> <b>aryl</b> thiols are {{fundamental}} building blocks in organic synthesis and final products with interesting biological activities. Over the past decades, substantial {{progress has been}} made in transition-metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, which resulted in the emergence of new methods for the synthesis of phenols <b>and</b> <b>aryl</b> thiols. Aryl halides have been extensively studied as substrates for the synthesis of phenols <b>and</b> <b>aryl</b> thiols. In very recent years, C–H activation represents a powerful strategy for the construction of functionalized phenols directly from various arenes. However, the synthesis of aryl thiols through C–H activation has not been reported. In this review, a brief overview is given of the recent advances in synthetic strategies for both phenols <b>and</b> <b>aryl</b> thiols...|$|R

In the iminopyridine Fe(II) system, the alkyl <b>and</b> <b>aryl</b> substituents’ effect exhibits significant variation on the isoprene polymerization.
