The linguist Gerald Green regards Life <b>and</b> <b>Adventures</b> of Remus as the Kashubian language's only novel; while theirs is more a scholarly judgement than an objective truth, the preeminence of Life <b>And</b> <b>Adventures</b> to Kashubian literature is undeniable.

Dr. Majkowski worked on Life <b>and</b> <b>Adventures</b> from his college days on, and the novel was only published in its three-book entirety shortly after his 1938 death.|$|R

5|$|Competition {{arose from}} other genres.

They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E
