She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that [...] "in many ways, the filming is <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> the drama.

We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} between December 1996–January 1997 at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California. The song was written just outside Hoppus' vocal range, requiring him to strain {{to sing it}} (the song has a noticeably rougher and scratchier vocal track {{than the rest of}} the album). Hoppus was having vocal problems during the recording of the album regardless, due to lack of vocal warm-ups and constant smoking. These factors, combined with the stress of recording [...] "Dammit", led Hoppus to strain his vocal cords significantly, forcing the band to cancel the final week of recording the album in December 1996. [...] "I <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> my voice a lot on 'Dammit'. It sounds really raw and cool," [...] said Hoppus in 2001. [...] "But it's not a technique I would recommend for getting a good vocal sound. You know, smoking, yelling, all that." [...] As a result of this incident, the chorus has always been sung by Tom DeLonge in live performances. Guitarist/vocalist Matt Skiba would also take the lead on the chorus after replacing DeLonge in 2015.|$|E

Tracy Jordan." [...] Julia Ward of TV Squad awarded this episode with 5 out of 7, and said that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) absence was upside to the episode, explaining, [...] "I <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> Jane Krakowski, but I can't say that I've missed her". Regarding Jack and Liz's relationship in the episode, Ward thought it was an [...] "uneasy mutual respect thing", which she thought let [...] "Alec Baldwin exercise his thespian prowess".

Gerrick D.

Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Ballad" [...] was {{not as good as}} the preceding episode, [...] "Wheels", but that overall: [...] "it did offer up a few choice cuts and fun moments while advancing one big story line".

500|$|Ferret-legging {{has existed}} for centuries, but the sport made a brief {{resurgence}} in popularity during the 1970s. According to a 2005 report published in the English Northern Echo newspaper, whether due to a [...] "lack of brave contestants or complaining wives", ferret-legging is now [...] "a dying sport" [...] that is being replaced by ferret racing, in which the animals race through a plastic pipe. Although the sport is now uncommon, annual competitions were held at the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival in Richmond, Virginia from 2003 through 2009. In 2007 the Manitoba Ferret Association held a ferret-legging competition in St. Vital Park, Winnipeg, to raise money {{in support of the}} organization's shelter for homeless ferrets. Marlene Blackburn, who works with the Ferret Rescue League to ensure that no ferrets are harmed in the sport, claims that during the years the competitions have been held in Richmond no contestant has ever been bitten, although some may get a few scratches. According to Kelly Yager of the Manitoba Ferret Association, the animals <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> small, confined spaces. Jay Lugar, spokesman for the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival, said ferrets are [...] "generally very harmless, fun-loving creatures."

Out {{of all of them}} his best friend is Milhouse Van Houten, {{although}} Bart has at times shown embarrassment about their friendship. Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse, and the two have been involved in a lot of mischief together. Because of this behavior, Milhouse's mother forbids Milhouse from playing with Bart in [...] "Homer Defined" [...] (season three, 1991). While at first he pretended that he did not care, Bart eventually realizes that he needs Milhouse, and Marge manages to convince Mrs. Van Houten to reconsider. Milhouse is a frequent target for local bullies Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. At times, Bart also [...] finds himself at the hands of their abuse. Despite being the more socially powerful of the two, Bart's social popularity has temporarily subsided various episodes either due to extreme embarrassment caused by his family or other people (or even himself) or an unfortunate coincidence. Milhouse describes their social standing as [...] "Three and a half. We get beat up, but we get an explanation." [...] While Bart and the bullies have been adversaries at times, with Bart once declaring war on Nelson, the school bullies <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> Bart for his ways and hang out with him at times, especially Nelson who eventually becomes close friends with him.|$|E

500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said Chris' {{habit of}} {{pointing}} {{directly into the}} faces of people he meets and repeating their names {{was one of the}} first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived. Chris' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born, and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character. Lowe's first day of filming on the series was his birthday (March 17, 2010), which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was shot. Lowe said he loved his character's [...] "unrelenting enthusiasm" [...] and the fact that he is not a romantic lead, but rather a [...] "big, fat nerd". Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger: [...] "It's a really fun character to play against because what you’ll see start to happen is Chris doesn’t want to deliver any bad news, but he’s <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> the Bad News Bear." [...] Like much of the rest of the cast, Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script. The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins' breakup with Chris, and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward, as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past. Schur said: [...] "Ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you." ...|$|E

My idea is that she <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
