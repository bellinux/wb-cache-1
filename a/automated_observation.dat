40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop an {{observation}} program for obtaining effective flat images that are necessary for photometric observation. The development of the program was achieved by improving the existing method for obtaining twilight flat images. The existing method for obtaining twilight flat images acquires flat images by observing the sky light after sunset or light before sunrise. The decision of when to observe flat images at each night is solely dependent on the judgment of an observer, and thus the obtained flat images for particular nights may not be clean. Especially, in the case of the observatories where an <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> system is in operation, there is a difficulty that an observer should pay attention during sunrise and sunset in order to obtain flat images. In this study, a computer program is developed to improve this inconvenience and to efficiently perform photometric observation in the observatories where an <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> system is applied. This program can obtain flat images by calculating the time for obtaining flat images automatically and the exposure time using a numerically calculated function. When obtaining twilight flat images at dusk and at dawn, the developed program performs <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> and provides effective flat images by acquiring appropriate exposure time considering the sunrise and sunset times that vary depending on the day of observation. The code for performing this task was added to Obs Tool II (Yoon et al. 2006), which is the <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> system of the Chungbuk National University Observatory, and the usefulness of the developed program was examined by performing an actual <b>automated</b> <b>observation.</b> If this program is applied to other observatories where <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> is in operation, it is expected that stable and highquality flat images could be obtained, which can be used for the pre-processing of photometric observation data...|$|E

The first overwintering team at the Dome Fuji Station conducted year-round surface synoptic observations under extremely {{cold weather}} conditions which had not been experienced by any other Japanese project before. Synoptic observation data of surface pressure, temperature, wind direction, wind speed and flux of global solar radiation were automatically recorded every one minute. These <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> data were obtained without trouble throughout the overwintering period. This was made possible by development of special instruments protected against frost and snow accretion, which had been the major difficulty in <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> in the antarctic area. Visibility, total cloud amount, cloud forms, atmospheric phenomena and present weather conditions were visually observed everyday at 09, 15 and 21 o 2 ̆ 7 clock in local time. We obtained these visual observations year-round at Dome Fuji Station for the first time. During our one-year stay at the Station, from March 1995 to February 1996,an annual mean temperature of - 53. 9 ℃ was observed. The lowest temperature of - 79. 6 ℃ for this period was marked on 18 August 1995. Annual mean surface pressure was 598. 2 hPa and annual mean wind speed was 5. 8 m/s. Except in summer, a rather strong wind speed of about 6 m/s was steadily observed throughout the year and the gust ratio was very small. That was a distinctive characteristic of the wind at the Dome Fuji Station. No prevailing wind direction was observed at the Station.

For this study, we used the imaging data with an exposure time of 1 s. As is demonstrated later, images with this short exposure time were more helpful for identifying the location of auroral brightening, even though the data were not obtained at regular intervals, because of the constraints of the software controlling the <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> system.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS), {{operated}} by the Nearby Supernova Factory since 2004, is a fully-integrated instrument optimized for <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> of point sources on structured background over the full optical window at moderate spectral resolution. We have developed a forward fitting technique for separating supernova spectra from their host galaxy background, capitalizing on the multi-wavelength, multi-epoch nature of SNIFS supernova observations. With a well-sampled point spread function from simultaneous photometric observations with SNIFS, we reconstruct the host galaxy spectro-spatial shape and extract the supernova spectra. This approach takes avantage of all exposures from each supernova time serie. This bias-free optimal extraction enables not only the spectrophotometry of the SNfactory data set, but also host galaxy studies based on extracted hosts. In addition, we discuss an alternative technique based on a subtraction of a spectro-spatial galaxy reconstruction. In this approach we reconstruct a host galaxy spectro-spatial shape using a SNIFS final reference observation with constraints from earlier epoch observations. We then subtract this reconstructed host galaxy datacube from the previous epochs, and can then use either PSF or aperture-based extraction as we see fit...|$|E
40|$|As {{computing}} {{systems are}} increasingly depending on networking, {{they are also}} becoming more vulnerable to networking malfunctioning or misuse. Human intervention is not a solution when computer system monitoring and repairing must be done fast and reliably regardless of scale, networking availability, or system impairing. Future network-centric systems must be built around a defensive architecture that allows computers {{to take care of}} themselves. In this paper, we argue that the solution to building self-defending computer architectures is a Backdoor, which can support <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> and intervention on a computer system’s memory without involving its operating system. Backdoors can therefore execute even when the functionality of the operating system of a critical system has been severely compromised and the system is no longer accessible through the primary network. Backdoors can be realized in hardware over a programmable network interface or in software over a virtual machine monitor. I. Motivation and Goals Despite decades of work on verification techniques, fault tolerance and security, computers and networks continue to remain vulnerable to failures and attacks. Increasing system complexity certainly does not help, even worse, it makes humanassisted monitoring, maintenance and intervention not only prohibitively costly but, more dramatically, unacceptably slow and sometimes ineffective. This problem is only going to become worse in the future, as the number of computing devices per person will increase while the vision of pervasive computing approaches its realization.

40|$|The {{statistics}} of clear-sky index {{can be used}} to determine solar irradiance when the theoretical clear sky irradiance and the cloud cover are known. In this paper, observations of hourly clear-sky index for the years of 2010 [...] 2013 at 63 locations in the UK are analysed for over 1 million data hours. The aggregated distribution of clear-sky index is bimodal, with strong contributions from mostly-cloudy and mostly-clear hours, as well as a lower number of intermediate hours. The clear-sky index exhibits a distribution of values for each cloud cover bin, measured in eighths of the sky covered (oktas), and also depends on solar elevation angle. Cloud cover is measured either by a human observer or automatically with a cloud ceilometer. Irradiation (time-integrated irradiance) values corresponding to human observations of "cloudless" skies (0 oktas) tend to agree better with theoretical clear-sky values, which are calculated with a radiative transfer model, than irradiation values corresponding to <b>automated</b> <b>observations</b> of 0 oktas. It is apparent that the cloud ceilometers incorrectly categorise more non-cloudless hours as cloudless than human observers do. This leads to notable differences in the distributions of clear-sky index for each okta class, and between human and <b>automated</b> <b>observations.</b> Two probability density functions [...] -the Burr (type III) for mostly-clear situations, and generalised gamma for mostly-cloudy situations [...] -are suggested as analytical fits for each cloud coverage, observation type, and solar elevation angle bin.

40|$|The {{automated}} {{measurement of}} rodent behaviour {{is crucial to}} advance research in neuroscience and pharmacology. Rats and mice are used as models for human diseases; their behaviour is studied to discover and develop new drugs for psychiatric and neurological disorders and to establish the effect of genetic variation on behavioural changes. Such behaviour is primarily labelled by humans. Manual annotation is labour intensive, error-prone and subject to individual interpretation. We present a system for automated behaviour recognition (ABR) that recognises the rat behaviours ‘drink’, ‘eat’, ‘sniff’, ‘groom’, ‘jump’, ‘rear unsupported’, ‘rear wall’, ‘rest’, ‘twitch’ and ‘walk’. The ABR system needs no on-site training; the only inputs needed are the sizes of the cage and the animal. This is a major advantage over other systems {{that need to be}} trained with hand-labelled data before they {{can be used in a}} new experimental setup. Furthermore, ABR uses an overhead camera view, which is more practical in lab situations and facilitates high-throughput testing more easily than a side-view setup. ABR has been validated by comparison with manual behavioural scoring by an expert. For this, animals were treated with two types of psychopharmaca: a stimulant drug (Amphetamine) and a sedative drug (Diazepam). The effects of drug treatment on certain behavioural categories were measured and compared for both analysis methods. Statistical analysis showed that ABR found similar behavioural effects as the human observer. We conclude that our ABR system represents a significant step forward in the <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> of rodent behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the quality and}} sophistication of optical telescopes commercially {{available}} has dramatically increased, with instruments in a class previously only within the reach of professional facilities now commonly possessed by advanced amateurs. A corresponding reduction in cost not only for these optical assemblies, but also for ancillary equipment such as high quality mounts, CCD cameras and computer hardware and software has meant that many areas of research, and in particular those appropriate for high school and university students, are now far more accessible than before, vastly increasing interest {{in the study of}} astronomy and astrophysics. At the same time, there has occurred a rapid expansion of the Internet, measurable in terms of its pervasiveness, richness of end-user experience and quality of infrastructure. The combination of these phenomena has meant that most of the issues that have stymied the development of remote and robotic observation have now been largely overcome. Since early 2004, the author and co-contributors from the University of Southern Queensland’s Faculty of Sciences have been developing a system for remote and robotic observation at the Mt Kent Observatory site near Toowoomba in South East Queensland, Australia.

40|$|AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO 2) {{capture and}} storage (CCS) in sub-seabed {{geological}} formations {{is currently being}} studied as a potential option to mitigate the accumulation of anthropogenic CO 2 in the atmosphere. For the verification of CO 2 storage integrity in the sub-seafloor, developments of the techniques to detect and monitor CO 2 leaked from the seafloor is vital. Seafloor-based acoustic tomography is a technique {{that can be used}} to detect emissions of liquid CO 2 droplets or gas CO 2 bubbles from the seafloor. An in-situ pH/pCO 2 sensor can provide rapid and high-precision measurements in seawater, and is therefore able to detect pH and pCO 2 changes caused by the leaked CO 2. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) installed with the pH/pCO 2 sensor provides an <b>automated</b> <b>observation</b> technology that can detect and monitor CO 2 leakage from the seafloor. By towing a multi-layer monitoring system consisting of a number of pH/pCO 2 sensors and transponders, the dispersed area of leaked CO 2 overlying a CCS site can also be identified. The seafloor-mounted automatic elevator consists of a buoy equipped with pH/pCO 2 and depth sensors, collecting intermittently a CTD-like data as it ascends and descends. Hence, CO 2 leakage from the seafloor is detected and monitored as follows. Step 1 : detect the CO 2 leakage by the seafloor-based acoustic tomography. Step 2 : map the distribution of the leakage points using the pH/pCO 2 sensor installed on the AUV.
