5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E

25|$|Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of {{environmental}} physiology {{is on the}} one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology {{and on the other hand}} one of the oldest. Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with ecophysiology, crop ecology, horticulture and agronomy. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{has used its}} public evaluations of historical, public figures {{as a means of}} communicating to the Chinese public the traits and political goals that it considers desirable and undesirable. The Chinese {{government has}} historically tended towards evaluating public figures either as villains or heroes, leaving little room for interpretation and making it clear whether the traits <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> individual figures should be emulated or despised. The public image of some figures, including Peng Dehuai, have undergone radical reverses throughout the history of the PRC, as required by Party propagandists: Peng was portrayed as a subhuman villain during the Cultural Revolution; but, since 1978, has been evaluated as a nearly perfect Marxist, general, and public official.|$|E

The above social, intellectual and cultural factors influenced the social work profession including social group work (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). With such a wide range of social and therapeutic needs there seemed to be an even greater appreciation of group work (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Hartford, 1964; Somers, 1976). Having expanded into differing practice settings, the purposes <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> group work had been more broadly described at this juncture than in previous decades.|$|E
25|$|Hungary {{used its}} {{relationship}} with Germany to attempt to revise the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its armed forces. Adolf Hitler gave promises to return lost territories and threats of military intervention and economic pressure to encourage the Hungarian Government to support the policies <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> Nazi Germany. In 1935, a Hungarian fascist party, the Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi was founded. Gömbös' successor, Kálmán Darányi, attempted to appease both Nazis and Hungarian antisemites by passing the First Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20% of positions in several professions. The law satisfied neither the Nazis nor Hungary's own radicals, and when Darányi resigned in May 1938 Béla Imrédy was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
