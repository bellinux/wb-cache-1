40|$|Abnormal NK cell {{lymphocytosis}} detected after splenectomy: {{association with}} repeated infections, relapsing neutropenia, and persistent polyclonal B-cell proliferation. Granjo E, Lima M, Fraga M, Santos F, Magalhães C, Queirós ML, Moreira I, Rocha S, Silva AS, Rebelo I, Quintanilha A, Ribeiro ML, Candeias J, Orfão A. Department of Hematology, Hospital S. João, Porto, Portugal. npp 46740 @mail. telepac. pt Abstract We report {{the case of}} a boy with hereditary spherocytosis who presented with mild microcytic hypochromic anemia and recurrent leg ulcers that had been present since childhood. Chronic natural killer (NK) cell and B-cell lymphocytosis was detected 1 year after therapeutic splenectomy during investigation of recurrent episodes of neutropenia and persistent lymphocytosis. NK cells proved to be abnormal at immunophenotyping studies, and B-cells were polyclonal and displayed a normal immunophenotype. Genotypic analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) -beta and TCR-gamma genes showed a germ-line pattern. The clinical course of this patient was characterized by multiple pulmonary infections and <b>amygdalitis.</b> We discuss the potential roles of persistent immune stimulation due to chronic hemolysis and severe leg ulcers and of splenectomy in the origin of NK cell lymphocytosis and the relationship between NK cells and recurrent infections, relapsing neutropenia, and polyclonal B-cell response...|$|E

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study assessed the medical records of 406 patients with AL from January 1995 to December 2004. Results: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 313 (77. 1 %) patients and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in 93 (22. 9 %) patients, including 241 males (59. 4 %) and 165 females (40. 6 %). Age ranged from 9 months to 15 years (average: 6. 18 y). The most common presenting features were fever (18. 5 %), musculoskeletal diffuse tenderness (15. 0 %), pallor (11. 4 %), and leg tenderness (5. 7 %). Prior referral to our center, the most frequent initial diagnosis was anemia (15. 8 %), leukemia (15. 0 %), <b>amygdalitis</b> (3. 7 %), and rheumatic fever (2. 7 %). Osteoarticular manifestations were found on 54. 7 % of the patients with AL, with a higher frequency among patients between 1 and 9 years of age (58. 7 %, P= 0. 0007). The presence of joint tenderness (16. 2 % in ALL× 5. 4 % in AML), arthritis (26. 6 % in ALL× 9. 7 in AML), bone tenderness (26. 1 % in ALL× 16. 1 % in AML), limb tenderness (49. 5 % in ALL× 25. 8 % in AML), and antalgic gait (32. 8 % in ALL× 9. 7 % in AML) had higher prevalence on ALL. The large joints, chiefly the knees (10. 6 %), ankles (9. 4 %), elbows (4. 4 %), and shoulders (3. 6 %) were more often affected. Conclusions: AL should be considered on the differential diagnosis of osteoarticular symptoms of unknown etiology in children...|$|E
