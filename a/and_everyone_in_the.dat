Lee was Chairman of the Ee Hoe Hean Club from 1933–1935 and 1941–1945. Lee was also one of six Hokkien representatives in the Overseas Chinese Association (OCA), which acted as a bridge between the Chinese community and Japanese military administration during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore.

Only Lee survived, as a bullet hit a Buddhist medallion on his chest; this inspired him to spread Buddhism in Singapore.|$|E

Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community is too weak from hunger to work.

On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home.

25|$|Lady Bu {{was known}} to be very {{accepting}} towards Sun Quan's other wives and she did not show any signs of jealousy towards them. As such, she remained in her husband's favour in the long term. In 229, when Sun Quan declared himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu, he wanted to instate Lady Bu as the empress even though his subjects nominated Lady Xu to be the empress instead. Sun Quan eventually agreed to his subjects' suggestion. Despite so, in the following ten years or so, the imperial family <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palace referred to Lady Bu as the Empress. Lady Bu died in 238 and was posthumously honoured as an empress by Sun Quan. She was interred in the Jiang Mausoleum (蔣陵; at the Purple Mountain, Nanjing, Jiangsu).|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mercer elaborated on the song's in an interview: [...] "That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald’s hired to do a “hip commercial,” or whatever. So the kid who offered {{the whole thing up}} to us was a Shins fan." [...] Online message boards (many on Pitchfork.com) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively commercialist. The band's hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled [...] "McShins, New Corporate Suck-ass" [...] in reaction. The ad's aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company's typical upbeat themes, and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive, considering a set of the song's lyrics, which at times refer to [...] "the dirt in your fries." [...] The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home. In addition, the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album, Chutes Too Narrow (2003). Mercer nevertheless [...] "recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising," [...] remarking, [...] "Imagine us playing [...] "New Slang," [...] <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience going, 'That's the song from the McDonald's commercial — I'm loving it.'" ...|$|E

Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Dallas Morning News, also stated that some viewers formed an opinion about The Hunger Games as a parable of the Occupy Wall Street activity. The Huffington Post reported that Penn Badgley, a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, saw the film as a social commentary on the movement. Burnett also states that [...] "Collins doesn't use the terms 1percent and 99percent, but it's clear that those in the Capitol are members of the 1percent <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Panem districts is part of the 99percent".|$|E

Clarence has a wide range of interests and hobbies, and despite sometimes coming off as a goofball, has an underlying intelligence. He is also missing his two front teeth, which perhaps explains why he speaks with a lateral lisp.|$|E

2500|$|A scrum {{is formed}} as near {{to where the}} {{infringement}} or stoppage occurred and at least five metres from either goal line. A normal scrum contains eight players from each team. If for some reason a team is reduced below fifteen men the scrum numbers can also be reduced, although there can never be fewer than five. The hookers binds with their props, the locks bind each other and their front row, {{with all the other}} players in the scrum binding to the locks. The referee makes a mark where the scrum is to be formed and waits for both teams to bind together. The referee then calls [...] "crouch" [...] (both front rows must crouch down) [...] "touch" [...] (the props touch each other's shoulders) [...] "pause" [...] and then [...] "engage". However, a shortened sequence is currently being trialed in which the referee calls [...] "crouch" [...] (both front rows must crouch down) [...] "Bind" [...] (the props secure binds on each other's shoulders) and then [...] "Set" [...] at which point both packs rows engage. When engage (or set) is called the two front rows can come together <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scrum must stay bound until it is completed. Once the referee is happy with the engagement the scrum-half from the team awarded the fee throws the ball into the tunnel (gap) between the two front-rows.|$|E
2500|$|Late Spring, in Wood's view, [...] "is {{about the}} {{sacrifice}} of Noriko’s happiness {{in the interest of}} maintaining and continuing 'tradition,' [...] takes the form of her marriage, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film—including the father and finally the defeated Noriko herself—is complicit in it." [...] He asserts that, in contradiction to the view of many critics, the film [...] "is not about a young woman trying nobly to sacrifice herself and her own happiness in order dutifully to serve her widowed father in his lonely old age," [...] because her life as a single young woman is one she clearly prefers: [...] "With her father, Noriko has a freedom that she will never again regain." [...] He points out that there is an unusual (for Ozu) degree of camera movement {{in the first half of}} the film, as opposed to the [...] "stasis" [...] of the second half, and that this corresponds to Noriko’s freedom in the first half and the [...] "trap" [...] of her impending marriage in the second. Rather than perceiving the Noriko films as a cycle, Wood asserts that the trilogy is [...] "unified by its underlying progressive movement, a progression from the unqualified tragedy of Late Spring through the ambiguous 'happy ending' of Early Summer to the authentic and fully earned note of bleak and tentative hope at the end of Tokyo Story." ...|$|E

Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
