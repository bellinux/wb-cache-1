40|$|Basically, legal {{protection}} against trademark {{is to prevent}} the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition.</b> This {{can be done by}} prohibiting another person to commit a breach of trademark law. For this purpose, trademark has been regulated in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 15 of 2001 regarding Trademark (referred herewith as Trademark Law). The role of trademark becomes significantly important in protecting industrial rights in intellectual works, maintaining fair competition, and encouraging fair and free trade. Under Trademark Law No. 15 of 2001, trademark registration system is based on constitutive system. Trademark Law No. 15 of 2001 sets out requirements, procedures for registration, registration fee and other proceedings. Based on this system, the trade mark owners have the right of registered trade mark by prohibiting other parties from using it without their permission. The trademark registration system, however, is hard for Small and Medium Size Microenterprise to observe, so that prevent it from registering the trade mark.

40|$|California is {{the latest}} state to set privacy {{guidelines}} for consumer applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. On February 24, 2004, state senator Debra Bowen introduced SB 1834, to amend California’s Business and Professions Code to cover RFID. If passed, violations would be considered an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition.</b> Key requirements include: • Obtaining users ’ written consent before their personally identifiable information – such as name, address or credit card number – could be stored in an RFID tag. • Getting additional written consent before that information could be shared with a third party. • “Reasonable measures ” to ensure that user data is transmitted and stored securely. • In retail applications, the RFID tag must be removed or destroyed before the customer leaves the store. The guidelines would apply to public agencies, too. In a press release announcing the bill, Bowen cited the San Francisco Public Library Commission’s plan to tag books, starting in 2005. That {{is one example of}} how homeland security agencies could use RFID as an end run around libraries ’ resistance to turning over patrons ’ borrowing records. SB 1834 was born out of two hearings last year in the Senate Subcommittee on New Technologies, which Bowen chairs. The bill also is one of the latest examples of recent concerns about RFID security and privacy. Such concerns have already {{led to the creation of}} groups such as Customers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion & Numbering, and on February 27, 2004, the German retailer Metro Group said that it would stop issuing RFID-equipped customer cards due to consumer concerns. SB 1834 is an attempt to set guidelines before the technology goes mainstream, the point where it is tougher and more expensive to revamp or replace technology that is already deployed. “There’s no reason to let RFID sneak up on us when we have the ability to put some privacy protections in place before the genie’s out of the bottle, ” Bowen said. At least two others states have addressed the concerns with RFID...|$|E

40|$|Several {{problems}} <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> {{are discussed}} in the article: a concept <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> in the doctrine of law, preventing it in the judicial practice in capitalist countries and new tendencies in a developement <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> laws. The study is of a comparative character, i. e. laws of the largest capitalist countries and at the same time, principal legal systems are analyzed i. e. French, English and West German regulations, with due regard paid to the systems of the United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden as well as of Poland (on account <b>of</b> the pre-war <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1926 on preventing <b>unfair</b> <b>competition).</b> A phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> was closely related to economic developpement of the age of early capitalism and fluorishing free competition, its concept in the European doctrine of law had its roots in the protection of exclusive rights falling within the scope of industrial property. In some legal systems the notion <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> was extended {{on the grounds of the}} adopted "right to goodwill" (fr. achalandage), "right to competition" or principle of "fair commercial practices". Preventing <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> in a judicial practice is based either on general principles of liability in torts (England, France) or on special laws designed to prevent <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> (Federal Republic <b>of</b> Germany). Judicial decisions are of significant importance in forming principles <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> prevention, In the United States the concept <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> which is understood to be a tortious act is regulated by anti-trust law; it involves not only actions which are contrary to fair business practices but also activities which can cause restraints of competition. In business practice, signs <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> are not only prejudicing interests of competitors or disturbing the principle of a full play of market forces, but they also prejudice consummers' interests. This aspect <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> is more often noticed in a doctrine of law and in legislational and judicial activities. Interpretation <b>of</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> itself developes into widening its scope to include questions of consummer protection. At the same time the tendencies are observed to control market activities in administrational and legal way in order to protect consummers' interests.

The thesis is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition.</b> The first chapter describes various attempts on the definition of the economic competition and explains the terms as economic aspect and benefit. The legal regulation of the economic competition includes direct and indirect regulation.

Direct regulation is devided into antitrust law, that prevents elimination, restriction or another violation of economic competition, and into competition law, that prohibits the competitors from using unfair practices in the battle for customer. In the second chapter the <b>unfair</b> <b>competition,</b> its development and its subjects are covered.
