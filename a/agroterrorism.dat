5000|$|Analysts have {{identified}} a number of characteristics of the United States’ agricultural system that make it very vulnerable to <b>agroterrorism.</b> Given that agriculture generally demands large expanses of land, farms are geographically dispersed in environments that are difficult to secure. [...] Also, livestock are usually concentrated in confined locations, which allows diseases to infect more animals quickly. [...] Although many experts believe the United States is susceptible to <b>agroterrorism,</b> they have never suffered from a large scale <b>agroterrorism</b> related attack. Many political scientists {{have identified}} the 1984 salmonella attack in The Dalles, Oregon as a small-scale example of an <b>agroterrorism</b> attack in the United States. A religious cult intentionally contaminated ten restaurant salad bars with salmonella in an attempt to influence a local election, sickening more than 750 people. Even though the United States has not experienced a large-scale <b>agroterrorism</b> attack to date, similar to its anti-bioterrorism initiatives, the United States government has passed several pieces of legislation and started initiatives {{over the past few decades}} to better secure its agricultural system and prepare for potential attacks.|$|E

The ultimate goal of <b>agroterrorism</b> in killing livestock and plants and contaminating food is to cause economic crises in the agricultural and food industries, social unrest, and loss of confidence in the government. Many experts believe that the United States’ agricultural sector and food supply are among the most vulnerable and least protected of all potential targets of attack, and they believe that terrorists have taken note of this.

However, these unconventional tactics are perceived by government officials and experts alike as serious potential threats. Some types of unconventional terrorism tactics commonly recognized by terrorism experts are bioterrorism, <b>agroterrorism,</b> nuclear terrorism, and cyberterrorism.|$|E

There are some major reduced crop yield consequences resulted from this pathogen. For instance, {{it was a major}} cause of Bengal famine in 1943, where the crop yield was dropped by 40% to 90% and death of 2 million people was recorded. Also, Cochliobolus miyabeanus was involved in <b>agroterrorism.</b> It was used as biological anti-crop weapon that aimed to attack staple crops of specific places. United States treated this pathogen as a biological weapon when attacking Japan during the Second World War; Cochliobolus miyabeanus was used as the biological anti-crop agent that attacked staple foods in Japan, which was rice. Other known severe crop loss cases caused by Cochliobolus miyabeanus are globally distributed. In the Philippines, rice seedling mortality rate records up to 60%. In India and Nigeria, total crop yield rate is reduced by at maximum of 40% solely due to this pathogen. Similar unfavorable yield losses are observed in Suriname and Sumatra as well.|$|E

40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are many potential targets for terrorists in the United States, {{one of which}} is the food supply system. An attack on the food supply system would create great need for information to many audiences, primarily the general public, about the risk resulting from such an attack. The Multi-State Partnership for Security in Agriculture, a collaborative effort of 10 states, has identified the need for development of a strategy for communicating to the public the risk resulting from an <b>agroterrorism</b> incident. Before the Partnership begins development of a strategy, however, it must take into consideration the factors that are important when communicating about <b>agroterrorism</b> risk: recognition that communication of risk about food carries with it specific challenges; the public's level of trust in government will affect how it perceives and accepts risk messages; and Americans' post-September 11, 2001 fear associated with terrorism alters perception and acceptance of risk. Recognition of the existence of these factors is not enough, however. The Partnership must recognize, as well, that these factors may present barriers to effective communication.

40|$|Corn is {{the largest}} and most {{valuable}} crop in the United States and a key component for ethanol fuels, processed foods, and feed for livestock. This crop may be threatened by those seeking to harm the U. S. economy by destroying or rendering corn unusable. <b>Agroterrorism</b> is a subtype of bioterrorism, which would use pathogens or pests to accomplish its goals. The current measures to protect the United States corn crop from being a target of <b>agroterrorism</b> are inadequate and underestimate the level of damage that could be done. Estimates place damage to corn at levels as high as 70 % crop loss and total a worth of billions of dollars. Because of this potentially large impact several solutions are suggested. The most secure means of protecting the U. S. from <b>agroterrorism</b> is through reduction of monoculture and increasing biodiversity. While some reduction is possible, it is less feasible in the current economic climate, thus the next best alternative is to take more preventative actions. The best preventative measures the U. S. can take is to create a public/private partnership between farmers, government officials, and biotechnology companies. These groups working together would attempt to detect and predict human manipulation or natural evolution of diseases that would be used by agroterrorists. Ideally these steps would be undertaken on the small scale, using funds from reduced corn subsidies to aid in its growth and development. So long as monoculture remains so widespread in U.

In order to make use of interactive communication to obtain collective intelligence from the public, emergency organizations must adapt to social networking technologies, requiring multidisciplinary knowledge in the fields of information, communication, IT, and biopreparedness.

While 71 percent of the households interviewed have access to improved water, 43 percent of these continue to use unsafe sources as their main domestic water source. Our results indicate that quality perceptions and opportunity costs {{play an important role in}} households' choice of water source. The effect of prices and income levels on this choice differs according to the pricing system used. Given that supply characteristics such as the location and pricing system affect household decisions to use the improved source, households may try to influence these characteristics in their favor during the community decision-making process for the improved source. However, less than 40 percent of the households interviewed participated in decisions on location or technology. We argue that the decision whether to participate depends on three main factors: (i) the household's bargaining power, (ii) the potential benefits from influencing outcomes, and (iii) the cost of participation, (mainly opportunity cost of time). Our results indicate that bargaining power matters In some developing countries the potential exists for <b>agroterrorism</b> to cause widespread disruption through loss of sustenance, income and production.
