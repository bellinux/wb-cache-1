500|$|However, the blockading nations {{argued for}} {{preferential}} treatment for their claims, which Venezuela rejected, and on 7 May 1903 {{a total of}} ten powers with grievances against Venezuela, including the United States, signed protocols referring the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The Court held on 22 February 1904 that the blockading powers were entitled to preferential treatment in the payment of their claims. The US disagreed with the decision in principle, and feared it would encourage future European intervention to gain such advantage. As a result, the crisis produced the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, described in Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 message to Congress. The Corollary asserted a right of the United States to intervene to [...] "stabilize" [...] the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if {{they were unable to}} pay their international debts, in order to preclude European intervention to do so.

40|$|II This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the recognition and enforcement of foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> under the relevant regimes in the GCC states, both local law and international conventions. The easy enforceability of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> {{is considered one of the}} main factors in the success of international commercial arbitration. Thus this thesis not only attempts a comprehensive analysis of the requirements of and procedures for recognition and enforcement of foreign awards in the GCC States, but also evaluates whether the GCC’s laws and practices comply with best international practice standards, especially as embodied in the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The thesis comprises of seven chapters.

40|$|Foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> {{should be}} {{recognizable}} and enforceable. However, {{this is not}} always the case; they are recognizable and enforceable in some countries but not in others. Those countries that recognize and enforce awards are mostly developed countries, whereas those which do not are mainly developing countries. This study compares and contrasts the recognition and enforcement of foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> in developed and developing countries with a view to discovering why they are recognizable and enforceable in some countries but not in others. In this study, the United States is representative of the developed countries, while Indonesia represents the developing countries. Three factors determining whether or not foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> are recognizable and enforceable are identified in this study. They are the availability and adequacy of the legal framework, the attitude of the business community, and the attitude of the courts. The inquiry, accordingly, focuses on an examination of those factors in both countries.

40|$|In my view, legislatures, {{rather than}} courts or parties, should decide whether (and to what extent) courts should review <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> for errors of law. The optimal {{legislative}} mechanism {{should not be}} compulsory but should offer parties the choice whether to 2 ̆ 2 opt-in 2 ̆ 2 to this regime of expanded review by inserting language to that effect in their arbitration agreement. A legislative solution with an 2 ̆ 2 opt-in 2 ̆ 2 feature has a sounder doctrinal foundation, better respects the distribution of power between various branches of government, involves a lower risk of error and minimizes transaction costs. From this position, two additional conclusions follow: first, courts should not review <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> for manifest disregard of the law; secondly, courts should not enforce party-based expansions of the grounds for judicial review of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards.</b> The article develops this thesis in three sections. The first section introduces {{the law in the}} United States on judicial review of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> for legal errors.

40|$|The {{landmark}} {{decision of}} the High Court of Australia in the recent case of TCL Air Conditioner (Zhongshan) Co Ltd v The Judges of the Federal Court of Australia [2013] HCA 5 reinforced {{the importance of the}} principle of party autonomy in international commercial arbitration in Australia. The case was highly acclaimed as a case that confirmed Australia as an “arbitration-friendly” country. This article examines the tension between the interest in finality and enforcement of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards,</b> and the interest in a quality award. The first interest would generally argue against contractual expansion of judicial review clauses in the arbitration agreement; by contrast the second interest would support a contractual mechanism for the review of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> and contractually expanded judicial review clauses. By enforcing contractually expanded judicial review clauses, the interests of the “winner” (with an interest in finality and enforcement) and the shared interests of both parties in a quality award (irrespective of them being winner or loser) will be protected. This article argues that Australia may be arbitration-friendly {{from the point of view}} that <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> will be enforced, but that it may only be fully “arbitration-friendly” if there is the possibility to enforce contractually expanded review clauses. A country that protects both the interest in finality and enforcement of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> and the interest in the quality of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards,</b> and will further give full effect to the meaning of party autonomy in the context of arbitration as a contractual form of dispute resolution, will be a truly arbitration-friendly country...|$|R
