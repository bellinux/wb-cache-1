According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), GM crops were grown by approximately 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries in 2005; up from 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries in 2004.

25|$|The city {{is known}} to {{manufacture}} pulses, shoes,scooters, masur, chasra, electrical goods and cotton yarn. The city exports these manufactured products as well as vegetables, purval, and milk. Patna is a major importer of cotton, iron, foodgrains, rice, wheat, wool, and dalhan. Rice {{accounts for more than}} one third gross <b>area</b> <b>sown.</b> Other important foodgrains grown are maize, pulses and wheat. Non-food crops consist mostly of oil-seeds, cash crops such as vegetables, water-melons etc., are also grown in Diara belt.|$|E

Under the high yielding variety programme, {{substantial increase in}} paddy production has been achieved, even though the percentage of <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> under paddy is decreasing year after year, due to conversion of paddy fields to other purposes. The average yield of paddy is recorded as 2146kg. per hectare. Next to paddy, coconut {{is the most important}} crop in the district. Coconut is extensively grown throughout the district. An important cash crop grown in the district is cashewnut. [...] The district plays a unique role in its cultivation and production.

5000|$|Mao Zedong's {{policy of}} {{self-reliance}} was relaxed, and his dictum [...] "grow grain everywhere" [...] was abandoned. Farm households began to produce crops and animals best suited for their natural conditions. Excellent cotton growing land in Shandong that had grown grain during the Cultural Revolution returned to growing cotton. <b>Areas</b> <b>sown</b> with grain crops declined, and <b>areas</b> <b>sown</b> with cotton, oilseeds, and other cash crops expanded. Reform policies also reduced major administrative barriers that had limited labor and capital from moving beyond commune boundaries. Households with insufficient labor or little inclination to farm were able to transfer land contracts to familiesthat were interested in cultivation and animal husbandry. Rural workers were permitted to shift from crop cultivation to commercial, service, construction, and industrial activities in rural townships. Capital in rural areas was permitted to move across administrative boundaries, and individuals invested not only in their own farm production but also in business ventures outside their own villages.|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} China's farmers {{annually}} planted crops on about 145 million hectares of land. Eighty {{percent of the}} land was sown with grain, 5 percent with oilseed crops, 5 percent with fruits, 3 percent with vegetables, 2 percent with fiber crops, and 0.5 percent with sugar crops and tobacco. Other crops made up the remaining 4 percent. In the 1960s and 1970s, when policies emphasized grain output, the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> with grain exceeded 85 percent. After the reforms were launched in the early 1980s, the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> with grain fell below 80 percent and the <b>area</b> <b>sown</b> with other crops expanded correspondingly.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> in collective {{use in the}} table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of <b>sown</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

30|$|The use and {{accuracy}} of the methodology can be heavily restrained in cases when data on agricultural yields (by crop <b>areas</b> <b>sown</b> and crop production), agricultural losses, and agricultural insurance statistics (including losses) are not systematically collected and archived, and/or are not publicly accessible.

For extremely small sample sizes (for example, less than five years of yield records), this approach is simply not applicable because the data series length falls outside of the bounds of applicability, and as commented earlier, would render very large uncertainties in the statistical inference.|$|R

As the {{raw material}} of tobacco industry, tobacco is the only economic crop which is intensive produced in China at present The statistic data is {{used to analyze the}} regional specialization and agglomeration of tobacco planting industry, but the spatial pattern of tobacco <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> is always neglected. In this paper, Henan province is chosen as the study area, and the distribution pattern of tobacco <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> has been studied using RS and GIS methods. According to the analysis of phenology characters of crops, the tobacco <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> and its growing condition were monitored using two-temporal data, which was in Jan and June 2008 respectively. Then the tobacco <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> of each county was calculated and tobacco patch was derived using ARCGIS 9. 0. According to the result, the regional Geordie coefficient which indicates industry agglomeration distribution status and the fragmentation index were studied. Results showed the higher regional Geordie coefficient means the higher planting scale at present, but does not totally equal the higher level of aggregation The fragmentation index of tobacco <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> shows different trend So both the economic coefficient and the fragmentation index should be considered during discussing the aggregation level.

The change of relevant factors of cultivated land pressure index over time is analyzed, as well as the tension level of cultivated land resources. Research shows that the pressure on cultivated land is relatively great in Fengxian County in the years 1999 - 2005. Grain supply and demand is still under the unsafe state. There will be more prominent contradiction between supply and demand of cultivated land in Fengxian County in the future, and the grain security will under greater pressure. Several countermeasures are put forward to ease the pressure on cultivated land in Fengxian County, in order to realize the sustainable use of cultivated land resources, to ensure the supply and demand balance of grain and cultivated land, and to stabilize and improve the grain productivity in Fengxian County, such as protecting the current cultivated land resources by the strictest protection system of cultivated land, enhancing the intensity of land development and reclamation, enlarging the area of cultivated land, increasing the agricultural sci-tech input, and improving the grain unit yield.

Did the project have influence to the grain {{production in the}} past ten years? And how much the influence is?

It analyzes Hebei’s fast-growing trees planting <b>area,</b> grain <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> and yield from land using angle. Research shows that fast-growing trees planting’s time and space difference is very wide in Hebei and each city, but its influence is very small for the grain <b>sown</b> <b>area,</b> and has no effect on total grain yield. Because Fast-growing trees can improve ecological environment and bring huge economic benefits, it can continue to be planted in Hebei’s suitable area in the future.
