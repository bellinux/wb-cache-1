5|$|Asian {{subspecies}} {{are sometimes}} referred to as the maral, but this name applies primarily to the Caspian red deer (Cervus elaphus maral), a subspecies of red deer. There is a subspecies of elk in Mongolia called the <b>Altai</b> wapiti (Cervus canadensis sibiricus), also known as the <b>Altai</b> maral.|$|E
5|$|Internal parasites of {{the alpine}} pika include many worm species, such as Schizorchis altaica, Cephaluris andrejevi, Heligmosomum dubinini, and Eugenuris schumakovitschi.Schizorchis altaica {{was found in}} {{individuals}} inhabiting the southern <b>Altai</b> mountains, and Heligmosomum dubinini in those inhabiting the Sayan and <b>Altai</b> mountains.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika inhabits mountainous {{areas in}} western Mongolia {{bordering}} the Gobi Desert, eastern Kazakhstan, southern Russia (Tuva, Irkutsk, <b>Altai,</b> and Krasnoyarsk) and China (northern Xinjiang and Heilongjiang). It is found on mountain ranges {{such as the}} <b>Altai,</b> Khangai, and Sayan, and is also distributed from the east and south of Lake Baikal eastward to the Amur River drainage. An isolated alpine pika population occurs at the northwest Ningxia-Hexi Zoulang-Gansu border, on the Helan Mountains. O. a. cinereofusca is found in Heilongjiang and Russia, while O. a. nitida is found in northern Xinjiang, Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. <b>altai.</b> A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. <b>altai</b> in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Siberia is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} polar region, owing to the dryness of the winter climate and has glaciers only in the high <b>Altai</b> Mountains, Verkhoyansk Range, Cherskiy Range and Suntar-Khayata Range, plus possibly a few very small glaciers in the ranges near Lake Baikal, which have never been monitored and may have completely disappeared since 1989. Between the years 1952 and 2006, the glaciers found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2percent. This shrinkage has been primarily in the ablation zone of the glaciers, with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers. The <b>Altai</b> region has also experienced an overall temperature increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last 120years {{according to a report}} from 2006, with most of that increase occurring since the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The female's {{fecundity}} is low, as {{with other}} pikas inhabiting talus piles, {{and the size of}} litters decreases as the elevation increases. A.F. Potapkina observed a seasonal {{increase in the number of}} offspring per litter. On average, the female of the western <b>Altai</b> Mountains produces two litters, while in the northwestern <b>Altai</b> and the western Sayan Mountains she produces 2.7 litters—with 10% producing up to three litters in the latter case. In 1984, G.I. Makushin and G.I. Orlov determined the average annual mortality rate of the alpine pika to be 53% for populations living in forests and 41% for those living in the alpine zones—most of them aged between one and three years. The annual population density fluctuations of most populations were insignificant.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{skeleton}} of Alioramus remotus is completely unknown except for three metatarsals (bones of the upper foot), but the discovery of A. <b>altai,</b> which is known from substantially more complete remains, has {{shed light on the}} anatomy of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Details on {{the retreat}} of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} {{than in most}} other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that {{since the collapse of}} Communism there has been a large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the <b>Altai</b> Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the <b>Altai</b> and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range area {{is home to}} a {{grassland}} ecosystem that has not been found elsewhere in southern or central British Columbia. It is dominated by communities of <b>Altai</b> fescue and lichen. Extensive and diverse alpine and subalpine vegetation is also present in the area, some species of which are at the northernmost or southernmost of their range.|$|E
5|$|The conquest {{strengthened}} Tang {{rule over}} modern Xinjiang, {{administered by the}} Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously {{under the control of}} the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the <b>Altai</b> Mountain region under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman Bridle Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2000 {{found that the}} genetic {{distance}} between jackdaws {{and the other members}} of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her Birds of South Asia (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (C.dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade. The names Coloeusmonedula and Coloeusdauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list. The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the <b>Altai</b> Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of the skull there is a protrusion, called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest is greatly thickened, {{similarly}} to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest of the skull, the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped in cross section, on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid. The braincase of A. <b>altai</b> was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} {{described in}} Asia include the <b>Altai</b> wapiti (C. canadensis sibiricus) and the Tianshan wapiti (C. canadensis songaricus). Two distinct subspecies found in China and Korea are the Manchurian wapiti (C. canadensis xanthopygus) and the Alashan wapitis (C. canadensis alashanicus). The Manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration {{than the other}} populations. The Alashan wapiti of north central China is the smallest of all subspecies, has the lightest coloration and is the least studied. Biologist Valerius Geist, who has written on the world's various deer species, holds {{that there are only}} three subspecies of elk. Geist recognizes the Manchurian and Alashan wapiti but places all other elk into C. canadensis canadensis, claiming that classification of the four surviving North American groups as subspecies is driven, at least partly, for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of the surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, the {{breeding}} season for Campbell's dwarf hamster varies by location. For example, {{the breeding}} season begins towards {{the middle of}} April in Tuva and {{towards the end of}} April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed breeding season and they can breed frequently throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the <b>Altai</b> mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a locking mechanism {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. <b>altai.</b> Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E
5|$|The largest dams in Russia are the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam, {{which has}} an {{installed}} capacity of 6,400MW; the Krasnoyarsk Dam (6,000MW); the Bratsk Dam (4,500MW); the Ust-Ilimsk Dam (4,320MW) and the Zeya Dam (1,330MW). Some {{of the most recent}} dam projects are the Bureya Dam (2010MW) and the Irganai Dam (800MW). The Boguchany Dam (1920MW), Zelenchuk Dam (320MW), Zaramag Dam (352MW) and Nizhne-Chereksky (60MW) are currently under construction. RusHydro is the largest hydroelectric company in Russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world. In October 2010, China Yangtze Power, the largest hydropower corporation in China, and EuroSibEnergo, a Russian energy company, signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in Russia and export energy to China's northern territories. The West Siberian Generating Company has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the <b>Altai</b> region before 2015.|$|E
5|$|During the {{turbulent}} reign of Wang Mang, Han lost {{control over the}} Tarim Basin, which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD 63 and used as a base to invade Han's Hexi Corridor in Gansu. Dou Gu (d.88 AD) defeated the Northern Xiongnu at the Battle of Yiwulu in AD 73, evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake Barkol before establishing a garrison at Hami. After the new Protector General of the Western Regions Chen Mu (d.AD 75) was killed by allies of the Xiongnu in Karasahr and Kucha, the garrison at Hami was withdrawn. At the Battle of Ikh Bayan in AD 89, Dou Xian (d.AD 92) defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the <b>Altai</b> Mountains. After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD 91, the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from {{the borders of the}} Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people. The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai (檀石槐) (d.AD 180), who consistently defeated Chinese armies. However, Tanshihuai's confederation disintegrated after his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1216, after {{requesting}} Muhammad II of Khwarazm not to aid Kuchlug, Genghis Khan dispatched general Jebe {{with two}} tumens (20,000 soldiers) {{to deal with}} the Qara Khitai threat, while sending Subutai with another two tumens on a simultaneous campaign against the Merkits. The two armies traveled alongside each other through the <b>Altai</b> and Tarbagatai Mountains until arriving at Almaliq. At that point, Subutai turned southwest, destroying the Merkits and protecting Jebe's flank against any sudden attacks from Khwarazm. Jebe relieved Almaliq, then moved south of Lake Balkash into the lands of the Qara Khitai, where he besieged the capital of Balasagun. There, Jebe defeated an army of 30,000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar. Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug's rule, Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug's policy of religious persecution had ended. When Jebe's army arrived at Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Kuchlug, forcing him to flee for his life. Jebe pursued Kuchlug across the Pamir Mountains into Badakhshan in modern Afghanistan. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group of hunters caught Kuchlug and handed him over to the Mongols, who promptly beheaded him.|$|E
5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the <b>Altai</b> Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authorities}} had included the northern pika as a subspecies of the alpine pika. However, in 1973, Nikolai Vorontsov and Elena Ivanitskaya, {{pointed out the}} difference between their chromosome numbers. In 1980, Vladimir Sokolov and V. N. Orlov treated them as separate species, with their ranges overlapping in the Khenteii and Khangai Mountains in Mongolia. It is believed that after glaciation, the ancestors of the alpine pika were restricted to {{the borders of the}} Sayan and <b>Altai</b> glaciers, as well as the periglacial region of the major North Asiatic glaciation. The American pika and the collared pika were also included as subspecies of the alpine pika, by A.I. Argyropulo in 1948, A.A. Gureev in 1964, and G.B. Corbet in 1968. However, in 1981, M.L. Weston found out that they were morphologically different from the alpine pika. In 1986, Corbet and J.E. Hill treated them as separate species. O. a. sushkini was formerly considered a subspecies of the Pallas's pika, but is now a subspecies of the alpine pika. The Helan Shan pika and the Hoffmann's pika were formerly included as a subspecies of the alpine pika, but are now considered an independent species based on their chromosome number, morphology, and bioacoustic behaviour.|$|E
5|$|After {{disappearing from}} Belgium before {{the onset of}} the 20th century, it has {{returned}} to breed in the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg and Burgundy, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The black stork is a rare vagrant to the British Isles, turning up in the warmer months—particularly in spring—generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in Scotland six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (Peebles). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern Transcaucasia. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in Fars province, Khabr National Park in Kerman province, Karun river in Khuzestan province, Qaranqu River in East Azarbaijan province, and Aliabad river in Razavi Khorasan province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the Ural Mountains, the black stork is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to 60°‒63° N across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in Xinjiang, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the <b>Altai</b> Mountains, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the Korean Peninsula, the black stork is an uncommon summer visitor, no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|The local habitat {{was rich}} in {{mammalian}} resources, allowing the <b>Altai</b> Neanderthals to permanently {{settle in the}} foothills of the <b>Altai</b> Mountains by at least 300,000 years ago. The <b>Altai</b> Neanderthals appeared to have chosen occupational sites primarily based on their strategic locations close to rivers and within valleys, locations ideal for hunting prey. During the early to middle Late Pleistocene, the broader region in general was most likely composed of forest and forest tundra, based on a mix of conifer and some broad-leaved trees. Under these conditions, the Altai-Sayan region provided the early hominin inhabitants with a very appealing environment.|$|E
25|$|Analyzing {{chromosome}} 21 of the <b>Altai</b> (Siberia), El Sidrón (Spain), and Vindija (Croatia) Neanderthals, it {{is determined}} that—of these three lineages—only the El Sidrón and Vindija Neanderthals display significant rates of gene flow (0.3–2.6%) into modern humans, {{suggesting that the}} El Sidrón and Vindija Neanderthals are more closely related than the <b>Altai</b> Neanderthal to the Neanderthals that interbred with modern humans about 47,000–65,000 years ago. Conversely, it is also determined that significant rates of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals occurred—of the three examined lineages—for only the <b>Altai</b> Neanderthal (0.1–2.1%), suggesting that modern human gene flow into Neanderthals mainly took place after {{the separation of the}} <b>Altai</b> Neanderthals from the El Sidrón and Vindija Neanderthals that occurred roughly 110,000 years ago. The findings show that the source of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals originated from a population of early modern humans from about 100,000 years ago, predating the out-of-Africa migration of the modern human ancestors of present-day non-Africans.|$|E

25|$|Presenting a {{high-quality}} genome sequence {{of a female}} <b>Altai</b> Neanderthal, {{it has been found}} that the Neanderthal component in non-African modern humans is more related to the Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal (Caucasus) than to the <b>Altai</b> Neanderthal (Siberia) or the Vindija Neanderthals (Croatia). By high-coverage sequencing the genome of a 50,000-year-old female Vindija Neanderthal fragment, it was later found that the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthals did not seem to differ in the extent of their allele-sharing with modern humans. In this case, it was also found that the Neanderthal component in non-African modern humans is more closely related to the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthals than to the <b>Altai</b> Neandertal. These results suggest {{that a majority of the}} admixture into modern humans came from Neanderthal populations that had diverged (about 80-100kya) from the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal lineages before the latter two diverged from each other.|$|E
