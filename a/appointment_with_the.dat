5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by <b>appointment</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> landowner.|$|E

5|$|Being {{popular in}} Australia with players {{as well as}} the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936. He was on the point of {{accepting}} a permanent <b>appointment</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Australian Broadcasting Corporation when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay. During the war, Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939–42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942–48) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster. He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees. On one famous occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting. He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently. In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen's Hall. Following an afternoon performance of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, the hall was destroyed during a night-time incendiary raid.|$|E
5|$|The Mamluk Sultanate annexed Syria in 1260, and {{maintained}} the imarat al-ʿarab. In 1260–1261, sultans Qutuz or Baybars replaced Ali or Abu Bakr with Isa ibn Muhanna, who was granted Sarmin {{and half of}} Salamiyah as his iqtaʿ. Ahmad ibn Tahir and Zamil ibn Ali contested Isa's <b>appointment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> former demanding part of the emirate and the latter seeking to replace Isa. Baybars did not accord Ahmad ibn Tahir a share but gave him iqta'at elsewhere in Syria, whereas Zamil opened a rebellion against Isa. The latter called for Mamluk support and Zamil was consequently apprehended by Mamluk troops from Aleppo. He was imprisoned in Cairo but soon after released after Baybars mediated between him, Isa and other Banu Rabi'ah emirs. A further challenge to Isa came from his powerful kinsman, Ahmad ibn Hajji of Al Mira, who eventually desisted from confronting Isa when Baybars gave him virtual independence in the southern Syrian Desert. Ahmad ibn Hajji was referred to malik al-ʿarab (king of the Bedouin) in Mamluk sources and numerous tribes came under his authority.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States after the war, Juskalian had an <b>appointment</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> regular army where he was ultimately promoted to lieutenant colonel.

His responsibilities included supporting the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff of the British and Americans and preparing briefs for Eisenhower. After his tour of duty at the Pentagon, he attended the Army's Command and General Staff College's regular ten-month course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1948 to 1949.

25|$|Nevertheless, he {{did find}} success in another {{branch of the}} government. In October 1911, in {{addition}} to reapplying to the army, Howard also applied to the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service.

25|$|In 2005, Nubia {{reportedly}} told someone {{at her school}} that her father was molesting her. Unclear on whether she had meant her birth father or her foster father, DCF investigated. They determined that she had meant her birth father and the case was closed. Then, in 2006, school staff called DCF to report a large bruise on Nubia's face that they suspected was child abuse. The Barahonas were ordered to bring her to an <b>appointment</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Department of Health's Child Protection Team in Miami, but {{did not show up}} until a week later. By then, most of the bruising had disappeared and state doctors agreed with the Barahona's assertion that the bruise was from a fall.|$|E

The following year, with referrals from Constantin Ion Parhon, he became chairman of the anatomy department at the University of Iași medical faculty.

25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning {{might be seen as}} one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an <b>appointment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E

25|$|Chappell {{was chosen}} {{over the other}} contenders Dav Whatmore, Mohinder Amarnath, Graham Ford, Desmond Haynes, Tom Moody and John Emburey in a highly publicised {{selection}} process. Although lacking the experience and coaching credentials of his rivals, Chappell had emerged as the favourite in the media, and secured the <b>appointment</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> active support of the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, who had earlier taken batting tips from Chappell during the successful 2003-04 tour of Australia. Ganguly had put forth Chappell's name twice in April 2005, even when other senior members in the national team were not consulted on the matter.
