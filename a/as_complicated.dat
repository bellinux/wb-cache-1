25|$|The Navier–Stokes equations, {{even when}} written {{explicitly}} for specific fluids, are rather generic {{in nature and}} their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse.

A decomposition algorithm is proposed, where the structure of the problem can be utilized.

25|$|The {{next step}} is the {{restoration}} of the book cover; This can be <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.|$|E
25|$|The term {{boilerplate}} {{originated from}} the use of boilerplate steel for the construction of test articles/mock-ups. Historically, during the development of the Little Joe series of 7 launch vehicles, there was only one actual boilerplate capsule and it was called such since its conical section was made of steel at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. This capsule was used in a beach abort test, and then subsequently used in the LJ1A flight. However, the term subsequently came to be used for all the prototype capsules (which in their own right were nearly <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> as the orbital capsules). This usage was technically incorrect, as those other capsules were not made of boilerplate, but the boilerplate term had effectively been genericized.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it is instructive to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> as necessary.|$|E
40|$|In {{pulmonary}} vein isolation {{as a treatment}} for atrial fibrillation the proximal part of the {{pulmonary vein}}s is catheterized. A protocol for preinterventional assessment of pulmonary vein anatomy was developed, based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in combination with three-dimensional visualization to tailor periprocedural angiography. The results allow for assessment of the number, morphology, and location of the ostia of the pulmonary veins, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>complicating</b> anatomical variations, such as common trunks and aberrant courses...|$|R
30|$|Depending on {{the initial}} {{substrate}} doping level, silicon nanowires present different percentage of porosity [15] which affects the basic mechanical and electrical properties of the nanostructure, influencing the depletion region, the band structure and charge traps <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>complicating</b> the realization of proper electrical contacts [16]. A reliable and robust approach to fabricate electrical contacts on SiNWs is {{required in order to}} discriminate different contribution to measured electrical features arising from intrinsic properties of silicon nanowire or from spurious effects such as defective electrical contacts.|$|R

25|$|Systems <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> as {{computers}} require {{very high}} reliability. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, {{for eight years}} before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. Hot-pluggable hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform. Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working {{on the concept of}} replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.|$|E
500|$|Moffat {{had planned}} the revelation about River Song [...] "for a long time"; when {{creating}} Amy, he chose [...] "Pond" [...] for {{her last name}} to create a link.

Moffat informed Kingston of the secrets of her character {{at the end of}} the previous series and she was not allowed to tell anyone; Smith, Gillan, and Darvill were unaware of the identity of her character. River's identity was kept in top secrecy; the script read at the read-through had a false ending, and only a select few were issued the real script.|$|E
500|$|The twice-divorced Brett Ashley {{represented}} the liberated New Woman (in the 1920s, divorces were common {{and easy to}} be had in Paris). James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created {{one of the more}} fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: in her presence, the men drink too much and fight. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes a Circe in the festival. Critics describe her variously <b>as</b> <b>complicated,</b> elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway [...] "treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy." [...] She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the other women in the book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.|$|E

30|$|Biodiesel {{production}} by transesterification of triacylgly-cerols (TGs) should proceed quickly if the feedstock has low moisture and {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) content, {{but it can be}} problematic if these optimal conditions are not met. The presence of FFAs and moisture in the feedstock are key variables affecting the efficiency of the biodiesel production process, resulting in soap formation and incomplete conversion of TGs to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>complicating</b> subsequent biodiesel purification. Beef tallow is a more realistic feedstock, dirty, containing particulates, and has moisture which should be refined before the transesterification process.|$|R

500|$|Media {{commentators}} characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Time's Lily Rothman viewed Marlohe as a [...] "mix of {{good and}} evil, strong and vulnerable, aloof and up for some intimacy with the ever-seductive 007". Julian Sancton of Forbes cited Sévérine {{as an example of}} [...] "the femme fatale whose moral ambiguity matches James Bond's own," [...] while Yahoo!'s Frank DiGiacomo regarded the character <b>as</b> <b>complicated.</b> The former described the character's personality as a combination of [...] "panther-like sexiness", [...] "snaky qualities", and fear. While discussing Sévérine's impact on the plot, Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress interpreted her as a pawn in the conflict between Bond and Silva. Sévérine has a titular instrumental track on the film's soundtrack, which is a [...] "string-drenched" [...] piece playing during her sex scene with Bond. To pass China's censorship laws, references to prostitution were removed from the subtitles. Sévérine's tattoo was changed from a symbol of a Chinese sex trafficking operation to that of a gang.|$|E
500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, and it was <b>as</b> <b>complicated</b> and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days {{figuring out how to}} make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last-minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last track to be worked for Medúlla.|$|E
