25|$|X's design {{requires}} the clients and server to operate separately, and device {{independence and the}} separation of client and server incur overhead. Most of the overhead comes from network round-trip delay time between client and server (latency) {{rather than from the}} protocol itself: the best solutions to performance issues depend on efficient <b>application</b> <b>design.</b> A common criticism of X is that its network features result in excessive complexity and decreased performance if only used locally.|$|E

500|$|VFDs are {{available}} with voltage and current ratings covering {{a wide range of}} single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690V. While motor-application LV drives {{are available}} in ratings of up to the order of 5or6 MW, economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings. [...] Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices such that any given voltage rating is {{greater than or equal to}} one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16kV (60Hz) or 3.3/6.6kV (50Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12kV switching. In some applications a step-up transformer is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications [...] greater than between about 375kW (500HP) and 750kW (1000hp). MV drives have historically required considerably more <b>application</b> <b>design</b> effort than required for LV drive applications. The power rating of MV drives can reach 100MW, a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, power quality, and reliability requirements.|$|E
