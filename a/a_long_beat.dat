60|$|Men, who are of one blood with sheep, have {{followed}} {{their friends and}} the railway along the river valleys where the towns are. Across the hills the inhabitants are few, and, outside their State, little known. They withdraw from society in November if they live on the uplands, coming down in May as the snow gives leave. Not {{much more than a}} generation ago these farms made their own clothes, soap, and candles, and killed their own meat thrice a year, beef, veal, and pig, and sat still between-times. Now they buy shop-made clothes, patent soaps, and kerosene; and it is among their tents that the huge red and gilt Biographies of Presidents, and the twenty-pound family Bibles, with illuminated marriage-registers, mourning-cards, baptismal certificates, and hundreds of genuine steel-engravings, sell best. Here, too, off the main-travelled roads, the wandering quack--Patent Electric Pills, nerve cures, etc.--divides the field with the seed and fruit man and the seller of cattle-boluses. They dose themselves a good deal, I fancy, for it is a poor family that does not know all about nervous prostration. So the quack drives a pair of horses and a gaily-painted waggon with a hood, and sometimes takes his wife with him. Once only have I met a pedlar afoot. He was an old man, shaken with palsy, and he pushed a thing exactly like a pauper's burial-cart, selling pins, tape, scents, and flavourings. You helped yourself, for his hands had no direction, and he told a long tale in which the deeding away of a farm to one of his family was mixed up with pride at the distances he still could cover daily. As much as six miles sometimes. He was no Lear, as the gift of the farm might suggest, but sealed of the tribe of the Wandering Jew--a tremulous old giddy-gaddy. There are many such rovers, gelders of colts and the like, who work <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>beat,</b> south to Virginia almost, and north to the frontier, paying with talk and gossip for their entertainment.|$|E

40|$|The {{exchange}} rate forecasting {{has been an}} interesting topic for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. <b>Beating</b> the random walk model has been the goal of many researchers, who applied various techniques and used various datasets. We tried to beat it using bayesian model averaging technique, which pools {{a large amount of}} models and the final forecast is the average of forecasts of these models. We used quarterly data from 1980 to 2013 and attempted to predict the value of {{exchange rate}} return of five currency pairs. The novelty was the fact that none of these currency pairs included U. S. Dollar. The forecasting horizon was one, two, four and eight quarters. In addition to random walk, we also compared our results to historical average return model using several benchmarks, such as root mean squared error, mean absolute error or direction of change statistic. We found out that bayesian model averaging can not generally outperform random walk or historical average return, but in specific setting it can produce forecasts with low error and with high percentage of correctly predicted signs of change...|$|R
60|$|It was the Sixth Sunday after Epiphany, and the collect {{began with}} the words: O God, whose blessed Son was {{manifested}} that he might destroy {{the works of the}} devil, and make us the sons of God, and heirs of Eternal life. Philip read it through. He could make no sense of it. He began saying the words aloud to himself, but many of them were unknown to him, and the construction of the sentence was strange. He could not get more than two lines in his head. And his attention was constantly wandering: there were fruit trees trained {{on the walls of the}} vicarage, and <b>a</b> <b>long</b> twig <b>beat</b> now and then against the windowpane; sheep grazed stolidly in the field beyond the garden.

50|$|One of {{the vital}} matters {{to be decided}} {{in the period of}} {{gestation}} before composition, is the overall length; and then the kind of proportions that best fit this length. The Symphony takes about 35 minutes to play and its four movements are tolerably equal, though the slow movement is somewhat longer than the others. So it is not <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> spun-out rhapsodic work, but a short, concentrated dramatic work. And this concentration, compression even, is made clear from the word go. The opening sonata allegro makes big dramatic gestures above the pounding, opening C's, and is driven along and never loiters. It divides itself into fairly equal quarters: statement, first argument, re-statement, second argument and coda. the lyrical quality of the slow movement is emphasised by presenting the 'song' of the song-form (after a short introduction) at first on divided cellos and later on divided violins. In between lies a lengthy and equally lyrical passage for all the string body. The woodwind and brass accompany the 'songs' with cluster-like chords decorated by harp and piano.The movement ends with a tiny coda for the four horns, a sound I remembered from the 'Sonata for Four Horns' which I had already written.The scherzo is entirely in additive rhythm. Additive rhythm means simply that short beats of two quavers and <b>long</b> <b>beats</b> of three quavers are added together indefinitely in a continuous flow of unequal beats. The movement has been called an 'additive structure', which I think very well describes it. At the central point heavy <b>long</b> <b>beats</b> are contrasted against light short beats in a kind of tour de force of inequality issuing in a climax of sound with brilliante trumpets to the foe. the movement then unwinds, via a cadenza-like passage for piano and harp alone to its end.The finale is a fantasia in that its four sections do not relate to each other, like the four sections of the first movement sonata allegro, but go their own way. Section 1 is short and entirely introductory; section 2 is the <b>longest</b> and is <b>a</b> close-knit set of variations on a ground; section 3 is <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> melody which begins high up on violins and goes over at half-way to cellos who take the line down to their bottom note, the C of the original pounding C's'; section 4 is a coda of five gestures of farewell.|$|R
